Once you have weighed 1 ounce of crisps, you can look further down on the food label to find the total grams of carbohydrate.  The G counted here, one ounce of crisps equals 23 grams of carbohydrate, this bag of crisps contains 10 servings.

Where am I going? What am I doing? Is that going to  Checked my blood sugar levels for most diabetics. That means it difficult NeverEnding routine of checking blood sugar watching what they eat and calculating insulin doses. But Katie took part in a clinical trial of an Innovative device. That's been dubbed an artificial pancreas. This is my sugar level at the moment. It combines a continuous glucose monitor that read your blood sugar every five minutes and then sends the information wirelessly to an insulin pump that releases the precise amount of insulin automatically.  Keys are computer algorithm that does those calculations faster and more accurately than any patient can it looks at the numbers from a moment to moment basis and will proactively predict what's going to happen next and make clinical decisions that cannot be done at that rate. You would have to be standing and staring at your glucose sensor the entire day and night Derek rap is the CEO of JDRF International which funded much of the development of the artificial pancreas. It means peace of mind for them and for their loved ones,  it allows them to lead a fuller more complete lives. Katie showed me how her device helps keep her blood sugar and very tight control critical to preventing the terrible complications of diabetes, but it's also given her peace of mind takes a lot of stress off of me as mentally thinking about it, but it also makes me feel better and physically have more energy and be healthier because it's keeping me in much tighter control at first you artificial pancreas will likely be for people who struggle  old to keep their blood sugar under control and experts say these devices are going to get much better but insurance coverage remains to be worked out.

       " \"Here's another reason to exercise. Researchers? At Joslin, Diabetes Center have seen that after regular exercise. Unhealthy, white fat starts to look like metabolically active Brown fat. We know that exercise is very important effects on the heart and muscles but exercise is affecting every tissue in the body. And now we have some really strong data to show that fat which we think of, as sort of as the bad tissue can actually function in a positive way. Lori Good Year in Christian Stanford used both human and animal models to show that. As a result of regular exercise training, white fat increases, its metabolic activity transplanting that trained fat into a sedentary animal model also showed beneficial metabolic effects. We're seeing the effects of adipose tissue affecting skeletal muscle affecting Brown, adipose tissue, and having whole body affecting whole body, glucose homeostasis. The trained white fat had more than 1000 newly activated jeans, specializing in a rabbit.  Up metabolism. So this really shows that exercise really improves your overall metabolic health and that the effects of exercise which are typically attributed to skeletal, muscle can actually improve adipose tissue function. So even if we're not seeing changes in body mass, we're actually seeing that the fat when you exercise become more metabolically active and healthier being able to make white fat act like brown fat could have clinical implications through good fat, transplantation or fat changing pills. Another research area we have going on in the lab, right?  Out is to really try to identify proteins that are changing within the train fat proteins that are being secreted from this fat with the idea that these could potentially become targets for therapeutic treatments, but I always like to emphasize that that exercise training affects so many tissues throughout the body to make one pill. That's going to mimic all the effects of exercise. I think is very difficult to do but I think there are  Our possibilities to activate some of the proteins that we know are activated by exercise. That could help in the treatment of diabetes or other metabolic diseases.\",\n",

       " \"Hi, I'm Ansley from diabetes what to know and I'm here today to talk about the signs and symptoms of diabetes many people wonder if they have diabetes and you may be wondering what are the warning signs of diabetes. What's the first clue unfortunately diabetes itself doesn't have any symptoms I say unfortunately because of diabetes, whereas easy to recognize as the common cold people would go to their doctor at the first sign of trouble instead. We can only look at the signs and symptoms of high blood. Her which often don't occur until diabetes is already in place some of those symptoms include frequent urination. If you're going to the bathroom a lot even during the night that could be a sign of diabetes as blood glucose goes up the body tries to get rid of that excess sugar through urine and the excess sugar drawers water with it so that you end up going to the bathroom more often this can occur slowly over a long period of time which makes it easy for people to ignore it or get used to it excessive thirst.  When you go to the bathroom more frequently Your Body compensates by increasing your thirst so that you can replace the Lost water. Now you may have thought that you were going to the bathroom all the time because you've been drinking so much water or soda or juice. But actually it's the other way around high blood sugar causes you to go to the bathroom a lot which makes you thirsty and if you drink sugary drinks like Kohler sweet tea, it only makes things worse blurry vision is another symptom of high blood sugar large changes in the glucose in your blood can temporarily  Change the shape of the lens in your eye causing your vision to be poorly focused or blurry. This is only temporary. There's no permanent change in the lens. Once you get your blood sugar levels within your target range your vision will improve another sign of diabetes is urinary infections and yeast infections particularly in women, if any of these symptoms persist you should visit your doctor a quick and easy blood test can tell you whether or not you have diabetes if you find that you do have diabetes.  He's know that you can do very well by paying just a little attention to it. Having diabetes isn't so bad unless you ignore it and then it can be very bad and remember all the signs and symptoms are caused by the high blood sugar not the diabetes itself. And these symptoms are temporary. Once your blood glucose levels are in range and stable you're going to feel a million times better.

There are a few different ways that we can screen for and diagnose diabetes. The most, common one is a hemoglobin A1c. This is a blood test that can be performed that will kind of give us an average of what a patient's blood sugar has been doing over 3 to 4.  A month time period, we do use it for screening as well. Sometimes we'll see that a patient is borderline or pre-diabetic and we can start to take more intensive, preventive actions to help prevent that patient from going on to become diabetic.

She has to check her blood sugar throughout the day to make sure it's not too high and not too low. Typically this would be done with finger sticks. She would check 15 times a day. That's no fun.

It tends to be within 10 to 20 points of my actual blood sugar which to me is fabulous these sensors check a glucose or blood sugar level in the fluid in between the cells. This gives you the same reading as checking a glucose level in the blood stream. These devices have been available over the last five years and they're getting smaller and smaller while it sits on the skin. It has a  a small filament that goes into the skin with an automatic inserter. My husband's been the one who's most of the time been inserting for me an alarm sounds when the sugar is too high and you can give yourself more insulin.

Yes, so currently the FDA has approved use of the device. But with two finger sticks a day for calibration, you do have to check I would say at least two to four times a day. It is a super reliable device as long as you're willing to calibrate it when I want you to and you may still have other inconveniences in everyday experiences.

This organ controls, your sugar levels, and produces a special juice that releases the nutrients from your food to help. Keep you in the best possible shape. The pancreas sits just behind your stomach. An appropriate home.  As one of its jobs is to break down the food, you eat, it aids digestion by producing a special tonic made of water, sodium. Bicarbonate, and digestive enzymes.  Sodium, bicarbonate, neutralizes, the stomach's natural acidity. So these digestive enzymes can perform their jobs, lipase breaks down fatty substances protease splits up proteins and amylase divides carbohydrates to create energy, rich sugars. Most of those nutrients then get absorbed into the bloodstream and go on to enrich the body. While all this is happening, the pancreas works on another critical, task control.  The amount of sugar in your blood, it achieves this with the hormones insulin and glucagon, which are produced in special cells called the islets of langerhans. Having too much or too little sugar can be life-threatening. So the pancreas must stay on constant alert. After a big meal, the blood often becomes flushed with sugar to bring us back to normal. The pancreas releases insulin, which makes the excess sugar move into cells where it's either used as an energy source.  Source or stored for later insulin. Also tells the liver to shut down sugar production. On the other hand, if blood sugar is low the pancreas releases a hormone called glucagon that tells the body cells and liver to release stored sugars back into the bloodstream, the interplay between insulin and glucagon, is what keeps our sugar levels balanced but a faulty pancreas can no longer coach us like this meaning that this healthy balance is destroyed.  It's weakened by disease, the organs ability to produce insulin may be reduced, or even extinguished, which can trigger the condition known as diabetes without regular insulin release sugar steadily builds up in the blood eventually hardening, the blood vessels and causing heart attacks. Kidney failure and strokes the same lack of insulin. Deprived cells of the energy-rich, sugar. They need to grow and function people with diabetes. Also tend to have higher levels of glucagon.  Which makes even more sugar circulate. Without this internal health coach, our sugar levels would go haywire and we wouldn't be able to digest important nutrients.

Five infection, 6 illness, 7 increased stress 8,  East activity, what are the symptoms of hyperglycemia? It is important to know the early signs of hyperglycemia. If hyperglycemia is left, untreated. It may develop into an emergency condition called ketosis signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia. Include one increased thirst to blurred vision. 3 frequent urination for increased hunger, 5, numbness or tingling in the feet. Additional early symptoms include one fatigue feeling weak, tired, too.  To sugar in the urine 3 weight loss for blood glucose of more than 180 milligrams per deciliter, five, vaginal and skin infections six slow healing cuts and Source, how can I treat and prevent hypoglycemia? If you have any of the early signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia, you need to one test, your blood glucose to test your urine for ketones. If you have type 1 diabetes and your blood glucose is more than 250 milligrams per deciliter, three. Call your doctor.

       " \"Hello, I'm Tom Mason from the diabetes, Council.com researcher writer and I have type 2 diabetes. Today. I'm going to answer the question is exercise good for diabetes. But before we get into that, make sure you download my free diabetes management book, which also includes a diabetes grocery shopping guide foods to eat and avoid by clicking the link below. When I first saw this question, I thought it was a trick is exercise. Good for diabetes. I mean, Exercise is good for anything, right? But then I started thinking I'm sure the answer is yes, but why? And that's where my research began. The goal of treatment in type 2. Diabetes is to achieve and maintain optimal, blood glucose lipid and blood pressure levels to prevent or delay. Chronic complications of diabetes. Many people with type 2 can achieve blood glucose control by following a nutritious meal plan and an exercise program losing excess.  Gasps wait, implementing necessary, self-care behaviors and taking oral medications. Although others may need supplemental insulin. Now, diet and physical activity are essential in managing and preventing type 2 diabetes. They help treat the associated. Glucose lipid blood pressure control abnormalities as well. As Aid in weight loss and maintenance when medications are used to control type 2 diabetes. They should augment lifestyle improvements, not replace them.  Now 2010 study by the American College of sports medicine made the following conclusion. Quote exercise plays a major role in prevention and control of insulin resistance, pre diabetes, gestational, diabetes type 2 diabetes, and other diabetes related Health complications, both aerobic and resistance, training, improve insulin action, at least acutely and can assist with the management of blood glucose levels lipids, blood pressure.  Cardiovascular risk mortality and overall quality of life, but exercise must be undertaken regularly to have continued benefits and likely include regular training of various types. Now, most people with type 2, diabetes can perform exercise safely, but you there are certain precautions, you need to take. But the inclusion of an exercise program or other means of overall, physical activity is crucial for Optimal Health, in individuals with type 2.  There's no question that exercise is good. But there are some things you need to be aware of choose an exercise plan. That's right. For you, whether it be an aerobic, exercise, yoga resistance, training cardio, training, weight, training, whatever you do. Make sure you check with your healthcare provider to determine if that program is right for you and monitoring your blood sugar is vital, check your sugar before and after you exercise. And if possible, even check it during your exercise.  Sighs routine exercise and most people with diabetes will cause a vast drop in blood sugar. So you need to have some type of card with you. Whether it be a drink or a fruit or a snack that can help you lift that blood glucose level after exercise. I hope this answered. Your question is exercise. Good or bad for diabetes. Don't forget to get your diabetes management book by clicking. The link in the description box below. And as always, let me know if you have any other diabetes related questions. Thank you so much for watching. I'm time.  Mason.\",\n",
       " \"So you have type 1 diabetes, it's something you're going to manage mostly with insulin a hormone. Your body doesn't produce when you have Type 1 Diabetes by now. You probably know how and when to give yourself insulin and if you have an insulin pump, you probably know how to maintain it. But do you know how to tell if something's not working? That's what we'll be looking at. You eat carbohydrates to fuel yourself with energy, your body breaks down the carbs into sugar which then goes into your blood, think about it, like filling up the gas tank in the car. When you eat your body stores, the carbs to use as energy, when you need it later, like filling up the gas tank, insulin is what opens the tank to let the gas in a someone with type 1 diabetes. You don't produce insulin naturally. So the sugar doesn't get to where it's supposed to be which is why you take insulin. If you're not getting the insulin, you need, the sugar, you eat stays in your blood, instead of being stored in the tank. When this happens, your body won't have the fuel, it needs when it needs it and your body will seek out alternative sources to break down into fuel. One of the first sources. It looks for is fat. Except when your body breaks down fat, it leaves ketones in your bloodstream that make your blood acidic together with high blood sugar, acidic blood from the ketones can make you sick.  Sick. And put your body in a state of diabetic ketoacidosis or dka. And dka is really, really serious. It can even be fatal, the most common reasons for DK. Happening are developing type 1 diabetes, missing taking your insulin, getting an infection and malfunctioning equipment. Your body will give you, plenty of pre dka warning signs. Before you're in serious danger, you made.  More than usual, which is your body, getting rid of the sugar that isn't making its way into yourself. You may feel thirstier than usual, which is your body. Diluting the unused sugar in your bloodstream with water. You may find yourself breathing faster, which is the way your body tries to compensate for acidic blood and you may feel tired and weak. If you notice any of these warning signs, check your blood sugar and also check your blood or urine for ketones if you are worried or you're not sure what to do. Call your  Your Diabetes Care team or go to the hospital.  Remember these easy steps to prevent Decay? A test your blood sugar regularly, always take your insulin. Even when you're sick. If you are sick, stay hydrated and you may need to take more insulin than normal. If you wear a pump check regularly to make sure it is connected and working. And if you notice any of the dka symptoms, check your blood or urine for ketones, want to know more about dka have other questions about managing your diabetes ask  Or Diabetes Care team and stay tuned for more videos to help you stay healthy and continue to live the life you want.\",\n",
       " 'Diabetes refers to a group of conditions characterized by a high level of blood glucose commonly referred to as blood sugar too much sugar in the blood can cause serious sometimes life-threatening health problems.  There are two types of chronic diabetic conditions type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.  Pregnant women May acquire a transient form of the disease called gestational diabetes, which usually resolves after the birth of the baby pre-diabetes is when the blood sugar level is at the borderline higher than normal but lower than in diabetics.  Prediabetes may or may not progress to diabetes.  During food digestion carbohydrates or carbs break down into glucose, which is carried by the bloodstream to various organs of the body.  Insulin is a hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas and is necessary for glucose intake by target cells.  In healthy people beta cells of the pancreas produce insulin.  Insulin binds to its receptors on target cells and induced glucose intake.  In type 1 diabetes beta cells of the pancreas are destroyed by the immune system by mistake.  The reason why this happens is unclear but genetic factors are believed to play a major rule.  Insulin production is reduced less insulin binds to its receptor on target cells less glucose is taken into the cells more glucose stays in the blood type one is characterized by early onset symptoms commonly start suddenly and before the age of 20.  Type 1 diabetes is normally managed with insulin injection type 1 diabetics are there for insulin dependents?  In type 2 diabetes the pancreas produces enough insulin, but something goes wrong either with receptor binding or insulin signaling inside the target cells.  The cells are not responsive to insulin and therefore cannot import glucose glucose stays in the blood. In other words type 2 diabetics are insulin resistant.  Here again genetic factors predispose susceptibility to the disease, but it is believed that lifestyle plays a very important role in type 2 typically obesity an active lifestyle and unhealthy diet are associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes.  Type 2 is characterized by adult onset symptoms usually appear gradually and start after the age of 30 type 2 diabetes accounts for about 80 to 90% of all diabetics management focuses on weight loss and includes a low-carb diet.',\n",
       " \"Diabetes diabetes is a chronic disease in which blood sugar is not processed correctly.  Insulin is a hormone designed to control the levels of blood sugar in your body blood sugars can become too high. If you do not produce enough insulin or if insulin does not work properly, there are different types of diabetes type 1 diabetes occurs when the body stops making insulin, but five to ten percent of people with diabetes have type one and it is always treated with insulin.  About 90% of people with diabetes have type 2 and it usually affects adults type 2 diabetes occurs when insulin does not work, well causing blood sugar levels to rise gestational diabetes is a temporary condition that occurs in pregnancy If you experience gestational diabetes, you have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease and should continue to follow up with your doctor pre diabetes is a condition in which blood sugars are higher than normal but not high enough to fit the criteria for diabetes.  Nearly half of the people affected with pre-diabetes will develop diabetes at some point in their lives signs and symptoms can include the following unusual thirst frequent urination weight change gain or loss extreme fatigue or lack of energy blurred vision frequent a recurring infections cuts and bruises that are slow to heal tingling or numbness in the hands or feet trouble getting or maintaining an erection. If you have any of these symptoms, it is important to contact your healthcare provider right away. It is important to recognize that many people who have type 2 diabetes.  He's have no symptoms. What are some of the risk factors for type 2 diabetes anyone over the age of 40 should be tested for diabetes. Every three years anyone who has one or more risk factors should be tested more frequently having a parent brother or sister with diabetes.

       " \"This young man had a problem where he he has diabetes. He stepped on a nail and he got a very serious infection and he got an ulcer on the bottom of his foot and it was down here underneath the second metatarsal and then it got an infection and it just sucked it up here and went all the way across his foot and then up through his foot and there was a hole all the way through the foot. When we first clean this out there was badly infected and he's been on this thing called a wound. Vac. Which is a negative pressure. Wound therapy machine for about five weeks and he's improved a lot in those five weeks. And here in the next couple of weeks. We hope to get him back to work. And on with his life. This just shows a lot of different principles of taking care of a diabetic foot and I'll talk to you a little bit about those. The first one is, you know, this probably could have been prevented with appropriate preventive measures like a good insole or custom made.  Eight device inside the shoe to take pressure off these areas, you know, once you did get an ulcer then that could have been treated with offloading may be a total contact cast by some Misfortune. He ended up getting a really bad infection. And so now we're kind of stuck dealing with a lot of tissue loss and he's doing pretty good with that.  And once we get him back up on his feet, there are some things we can do to sort of prevent this from ever happening again. So what we're going to apply now is collagen, and what collagen is, is the building block, that sort of like a scaffold for tissue to grow into and that's one of the reasons we've been able to get this patient to heal. So rapidly, he had a lot of tissue loss with a big defect and he's all filled in now because we've been using this college and material and collagen is, you know,  Just a white powdery substance and just put it on the wound. Put it up out.  A quarter thickness, we're going to put this sponge on. Now, what this sponge does. This sponge is a, it's an open cell foam, which means it all communicates with itself. Let's say you were to put one half of the sponge in the water and suck on it. The water would come. All the way up through the sponge if it was all sealed, because that's what open cell foam means. It means that it's, it's open all the way down. So this is open cell foam and that's kind of how it works. So now you can see the sponge. It's all nice and puffy. It's not squeeze down at all.  We cut a hole in this sealer, that we've wrapped around his foot.  Attach the  The part that goes to the suction canister.  Plug that in.  So what this thing does, is it maintains a pressure of - 125 millimeters of mercury continuously or you can set it up for alternating pressure. But basically that the principle of it is it increases circulation in the area in the area of the wound by about anywhere from 25 to 40 percent depending on the study that you agreed. And so, what this does is it romantically increases the rate of healing that occurs inside this foot. So, this thing cuts the Heat  Time probably. If you with a would like the one that you had it would probably would have taken two or three months to heal and this has been about a month. So, with collagen, and the wound VAC, you know, we've really dramatically decrease the curing time for him to get back to work and normal lifestyle. We'll see you soon. Maybe about 5 or 5 days, okay.\",\n",
       " \"Tingling or numbness affecting your feet may seem like a trivial symptom of no real importance. However, in this video, I will explain why this symptom may be very important with regard to your health in general and why you should not ignore it.  Tingling hands feet or hands and feet is an extremely common and bothersome symptom such tingling can sometimes be entirely innocent and temporary. For example, it could result from pressure on nerves when your arm is bent under your head as you fall asleep or it could be from pressure on nerves. When you cross your legs for too long in either case the pins and needles effect, which is usually painless is soon relieved by  Removing the pressure that caused it.  In many cases, however, tingling in the hands and feet can be severe occurring at regular times or continuously day and night. It can also accompany other symptoms such as pain pitching numbness and muscle wasting in such cases tingling may be a sign of nerve damage. Now this sort of nerve damage is known by doctors as peripheral.  Apathy because it affects the nerves distant from the brain and spinal cord often in the hands and feet. There are more than a hundred different types of peripheral neuropathy and overtime peripheral neuropathy can worsen resulting in decreased mobility and even disability. In fact diabetes is the number one cause of peripheral neuropathy accounting for well over a  A third of cases in diabetic neuropathy tingling and other symptoms often first develop in the feet and then they go up the legs followed by tingling and other symptoms affecting the hands which then go up the arms about two-thirds of people with diabetes have mild to severe forms of nerve damage. And in many cases these symptoms are the very first sign.  Of diabetes. So here's the main point. I want to make tingling and numbness in the feet may be the first sign that you have serious peripheral neuropathy and that you might have diabetes Now diabetes puts you at risk of heart attack stroke, kidney failure blindness and a huge long list of other serious complications.  So that tingling that you have could be your only warning sign of a serious complication developing elsewhere in your body. Don't ignore the symptom and please get a checkup.

       " \"Hey, this is Dr. K from imedicalschool. And today we're going to talk about how to diagnose diabetes. Let's first start off by discussing. What is diabetes diabetes is when the body is unable to regulate levels of sugar or glucose causing the glucose levels to go sky-high. The complications of diabetes include microvascular and macrovascular complications these include coronary artery disease Peripheral arterial disease kidney failure retinopathy and neuropathy now, why does it I lose control serum glucose will remember the pancreatic beta cells are responsible for producing insulin insulin causes a decrease in serum glucose. So they're generally two causes to diabetes either low insulin production or increase insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes an autoimmune response occurs where the body attacks the pancreatic insulin producing beta cells in doing so the body is unable to produce.  Zeus an adequate amount of insulin we can test for this autoimmune response by testing for particular antibodies these antibodies include anti glutamic acid decarboxylase and to islet cell autoantibodies and anti insulin antibodies surprisingly. These antibodies have also been shown in type 2 diabetes in decaying that with long-standing type 2 diabetes. There may be an underlying autoimmune process type 2 diabetes occurs due to insulin resistance.  So as a society, we love our fast food and fatty foods me included as her intake of carbs and sugar increases our body tries to regulate the elevated sugars. So our bodies produces tons and tons of insulin after some time the body becomes desensitized to the high levels of insulin and the body has to produce more to achieve the same effects. This cycle continues producing a relative insulin deficiency due to insulin resistance with weight loss and a  Diet the insulin resistance can improve so how do we diagnose diabetes while the diagnosis of diabetes is based on symptoms and lab work. It's important to take a history to identify symptoms of hyperglycemia, like polyuria polydipsia Vision blurriness or changes fatigue and abdominal pain polyuria means having excessive urination. It's due to glucose being spilled into the urine pulling water with it polydipsia means having an excessive thirst and this is  The body's way of trying to regain that water loss due to the glucose pulling water into the urine in terms of lab work. The diagnosis of diabetes can be established if random glucose is 200 or greater with hyperglycemic symptoms in addition a fasting plasma glucose of 126 or greater a to our post glucose challenge of 200 or greater or a hemoglobin A1c of 6.5 are greater is diagnostic of diabetes. If a  I work meets the criteria. It needs to be repeated for confirmation. In addition. There are two high risk groups for developing diabetes these include impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance impaired fasting glucose is defined by fasting plasma glucose of 100 to 125 impaired glucose tolerance is defined after a patient has had a 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test if they're to our plasma glucose is 142 199.  And then they have impaired glucose tolerance. Well, that was a brief overview of how to diagnose diabetes in the future. We will talk about treatment and medical management of diabetic.

       " \"Hello, I'm Tom Mason of the diabetes, Council.com researcher writer and I have type 2 diabetes. Today. I want to talk to you about whether or not you need diabetes medication after you watch the video. Today. I invite you to check out the description box for my new ebook. This is one of the most comprehensive diabetes meal planning books. You'll find anywhere it contains. Diabetes friendly meals and recipes recipes for different goals, such as 800 to. 1,800 calories per day meal plan, diabetes meal, planning tips and tricks. And there are also tons of diabetes, friendly recipes for everyone. Now, the answer, this question, really depends on several factors. The first of which is what type of Diabetes do you have? So, let's first breakdown, type 1 and type 2 type 1, diabetes. Well, if you have that then you are insulin-dependent. If you have type 1 then approximately 90% of  your insulin producing cells have been destroyed and sadly the process that destroyed the 90% of insulin producing cells will destroy the remaining. 10%, Ultimately, you will be totally dependent on insulin type 1. Diabetes cannot be managed without medication, and this is not my opinion. It's the opinion of the foremost diabetes center in the world. The Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. Here's what they have to say on the matter. If you have type 1 diabetes, you must take  Daily insulin injections to keep your blood glucose in normal range, your body produces little or no insulin. Insulin is a vital hormone that helps your body convert food into energy, without insulin, you would die. So the answer is far as type 1. Diabetes goes. Well, it's yes, you do need your diabetes medication. But what about type 2. Well, here's what Joseline has to say about that. If you have type 2 diabetes, the answer. This question is much.  It's clear. Many people can keep their blood glucose in a healthy range without medications either oral or insulin if they lose weight and keep their weight down, our regular physically active and follow a meal plan that helps them keep their portion sizes under control. So yes, it is possible for people with diabetes to maintain their blood sugar without medication. So, do you need it? Well, sometimes know, you see the key to managing your diabetes.  Beatty's is to lose weight and regularly exercise and this isn't something you try for a month. This is a lifelong commitment and it can be done. But many fail, eventually many people with type 2, diabetes, find the despite, their best efforts weight control, exercise and diet aren't enough to keep their blood glucose in a healthy range. And this is not unusual and it's not your fault. One theory. Is that some people's insulin-producing cells. Just get tired out from having  To produce more and more insulin because their cells are resistant to the effects of insulin. If your healthcare provider tells you, you need to take oral diabetes medications or insulin injections to manage your blood glucose. It's very important. You follow their instructions, keeping your blood glucose in a healthy range is key to preventing long-term complications such as eye disease, kidney disease, heart attacks and other problems that poorly controlled blood glucose can cause over a period of years including  Amputation. If you want to try and manage your diabetes without medication, then you must let your healthcare provider know your intentions and you need to monitor everything. Very closely. Don't just wake up one day and say I'll Eat Right today. Walk two miles. So I don't need my meds. That would not be a good move.  Don't forget to get my new e-book and please subscribe to our channel for many more videos like this one in the future. I want to thank you so much for watching. I'm Tom Mason.\",\n",
       " \"I've talked about the role meet may play an increasing the risk of diabetes and the potential protective role of healthy plant foods, but plant-based diet is not only appear to guard against getting diabetes in the first place. They may successfully treat the disease better than diabetic. Diets patients are typically placed on controlling weight and cholesterol diet is based on whole plant foods. Can result in significant weight loss without any limits on portion size, or calorie counting. Because plant Foods tend to be so calorically. Here's 100, calories of broccoli, tomatoes, and strawberries, compared that to 100 calories of chicken cheese or fish. People just can't seem to eat enough to compensate for the calorie deficit. So lose weight, eating whole plant foods and most importantly, it works better plant based diet, beat out the confession. American Diabetes Association died in a head-to-head, randomized, controlled clinical trial without restricting Porsches. No calorie or carb.  Owning a review of all such studies found. The individuals. Following plant-based diets experience improved reductions in blood sugar's body weight and cardiovascular risk. Compared with those following diets. That included animal products. And cardiovascular risk is what, kills diabetics. The most are more likely to get strokes more likely, heart failure. In fact, diabetes has been proposed as a coronary heart disease. Risk equivalent, meaning diabetic patients, without a history of coronary disease. Have an equivalent risk to  Those non-diabetic individuals with confirmed heart disease. A newer study used a technique to actually measure insulin sensitivity, improved on both diets in the first three months, but then the veg diet pulled ahead and look at their LDL cholesterol. That's what we see when people are put on a plant-based diets. Cholesterol comes down so much can actually reverse the athletes closest progression. Reverse the progression.  Session of heart disease. We know about the beneficial effect of vegetarian diets on controlling way blood sugar is cholesterol insulin sensitivity and oxidative stress compared to Conventional diabetic diets. What about quality of life, mood? How do people feel after making such a dramatic change in their diets in this randomized, controlled trial. Study subjects were assigned either to a plant-based diet, group or control group vegetables, grains beans, fruits and nuts with animal products limited to a maximum of  Daily portion of low-fat yogurt and the control group got the official diabetes diet quality of life improved on both dies in the first few months, but within six months, the plant based group clearly pulled ahead. Same thing with depression scores dropped in both groups in the first three months, but started to Rebound in the control group, bottom line, the more plant-based diet led to a greater Improvement in quality of life and mood patients.  Consuming a vegetarian diet, also felt less constrained than those consuming. The conventional diet people actually felt the conventional diabetic diet was more restrictive than the plant-based diet disinhibition decreased with a vegetarian diet. Meaning those eating vegetarian were less likely to binge and the veg group folks, tended to feel less hungry, all of, which helps with sustainability in the long term, which is, of course, critical for changing diet. So, not only do plant-based diets appear to work better, but they may be easier to  Stick to with the Improvement. In mood patients, May exhibit desired improvements.

       " \"Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar level is one of the commonly found conditions in people with diabetes.  Hypoglycemia can be defined as blood sugar level below 70 mg / DL it can occur in any person with diabetes who is on insulin our blood sugar lowering medications.  Let's look at some common causes of hypoglycemia.  Excess insulin dose or medication is one of the most common causes for hypoglycemia not eating enough or not eating at proper time skipping or delaying meals not eating enough after consuming alcohol or some other reasons unplanned or excessive exercise may also lead to hypoglycemia.  Now what are the symptoms of hypoglycemia, according to the type of hypoglycemia? The symptoms can change mild hypoglycemia, give symptoms like headache shaking pounding heartbeat sweating tiredness dizziness blurred vision drowsiness or tingling sensation around mouth or lips mild. Hypoglycemia can be managed easily.  Madras hypoglycemia, give symptoms like personality change irritability confusion poor coordination difficulties in concentrating or slurred speech.  This type of hypoglycemia can be managed, but it requires immediate attention.  The third type severe hypoglycemia leads to Coma or seizures.  Severe hypoglycemia requires emergency treatment the patient needs to be hospitalized for the management of severe hypoglycemia.  Know how to detect hypoglycemia. It is very simple based on symptoms and by checking your blood sugar level immediately after symptoms will give you an idea whether you're suffering from hypoglycemia.  The other indication of hypoglycemia is when blood sugar level is increased the symptoms disappear.  How to treat hypoglycemia remember early recognition and appropriate treatment is the key to manage and treat hyperglycemia. The rule of 15 is a very helpful way to remember the treatment.  Rudolph 15 says you have to eat 15 grams of fast-acting carbohydrates after the episode of hypoglycemia, 15 grams of carbohydrates may include 15 grams of glucose powder or powdered sugar 1 tablespoon of honey, or Jam half a glass of fruit juice or soft drink.  You can have one of the above options immediately after the episode of hypoglycemia. Then you have to wait for 15 minutes and re-check your blood sugar level.  If the blood sugar level is above 70, you're supposed to have a light snack to prevent further episodes of hypoglycemia. If blood sugar level is below 70, then you have to repeat 15 grams of carbs and wait for another 15 minutes.  You have to re-check your blood sugar to ensure whether your blood sugar level is above 70 the treatment of hypoglycemia should always be followed by some investigation as to why the hypoglycemia or occurred and what could be done to prevent its further occurrence. Thank you.\",\n",
       " 'Alpha-glucosidase Inhibitors are oral anti-diabetic. Drugs used for diabetes mellitus type 2 that work by preventing the digestion of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are normally converted into simple sugars, which can be absorbed through the intestine. Hence, alpha-glucosidase Inhibitors, reduce the impact of carbohydrates, on blood sugar examples and differences examples of alpha-glucosidase Inhibitors include acaba spree Coes Maglite all  guys at Vogue Lobos, even though the drugs have a similar mechanism of action. There are subtle differences between a car bus and Maglite. All acarbose is an oligosaccharide whereas Maglite ol resembles a, monosaccharide Maglite ol is fairly well absorbed by the body as opposed to acarbose. Moreover acabas, inhibits pancreatic alpha-amylase. In addition to alpha-glucosidase, Natural alpha-glucosidase Inhibitors. There are a large number of natural.  Products with alpha-glucosidase Inhibitors action, for example, research has shown the culinary mushroom attack has a hypoglycemic effect. The reason my attack lowers blood sugar is because the mushroom naturally contains an alpha-glucosidase Inhibitors. Another plant attracting a lot of attention is a laser oblinger role in clinical. Use alpha-glucosidase, Inhibitors are used to establish greater glycemic control over hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus type 2.  Two particularly with regard to postprandial hyperglycemia. They may be used as monotherapy in conjunction with an appropriate diabetic diet and exercise or they may be used in conjunction with other anti-diabetic drugs alpha-glucosidase Inhibitors, may also be useful in patients with diabetes, mellitus type 1. However, this use has not been officially approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Mechanism of action alpha-glucosidase Inhibitors are  The rides that act as competitive Inhibitors of enzymes needed to digest carbohydrates specifically alpha-glucosidase enzymes, in the brush border of the small intestines. The membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidase is hydrolyzed, oligosaccharides trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose, and other monosaccharides in the small intestine acarbose. Also blocks pancreatic alpha-amylase. In addition to inhibiting, membrane-bound alpha-glucosidase has  Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the Lumen of the small intestine inhibition of these enzyme. Systems reduces the rate of digestion of carbohydrates less glucose is absorbed because the carbohydrates are not broken down into glucose molecules in diabetic patients, the short term effect of these drugs therapies is to decrease current blood glucose levels. The long-term effect is a small reduction in hemoglobin A1c.  Level dosing, since alpha-glucosidase Inhibitors are competitive Inhibitors of the digestive enzymes. They must be taken at the start of main meals to have maximal effect their effects on blood sugar levels, following meals will depend on the amount of complex carbohydrates in the meal, side effects and precautions since alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, prevent the degradation of complex carbohydrates into glucose. The carbohydrates will remain in the intestine in the  colon bacteria will digest the complex carbohydrates. Thereby causing gastrointestinal side effects such as flatulence and diarrhea. Since these effects are dose-related. It is generally advised to start with a low dose and gradually increase the dose to the desired amount pneumatosis. Sisto hits intestinalis, is another reported side effect. If a patient using an alpha-glucosidase Inhibitors suffers from an episode of hypoglycemia, the patient should eat something.

       " \"A fourth group of medication is one that we call Fires older Dean diodes.  We just use the word T's Edie's for short in order to pronounce it easily.  There are two agents made in this fashion. They are called avandia or Raza glitter Zone and Actos or pioglitazone.  These agents are a little bit different than anything else in that. They work in the body to reduce insulin resistance. They work on the muscle cells and the fat cells of your body and enable them to use insulin better and therefore reduce your blood sugar very effectively. Avandia comes as a 2 4 or 8 milligram tablet and it's taken once a day or sometimes twice a day.  Actos comes as a fifteen Thirty or forty five milligram tablet and is also taken once a day.  The big thing about these two agents is that they don't cause an excessively low blood sugar. And therefore we don't really need to test our blood sugar as often when we take that medicine in order to identify hypoglycemia because it won't happen.  However, these agents do have some adverse effects. They cause some fluid retention. And therefore if you have heart failure, you should not take these medications. There was a question whether there was an increased incidence of heart attack actually with avandia, but in recent studies that has not been shown to be the case, even though there was an increase incidence of heart attack in patients who had fluid retention and  heart failure  There is one other side effect of these drugs which is of some importance. It has recently been shown that they cause a weakening of the bones or osteoporosis and may lead to fractures but it's a you unusual fracture site. It's the law the bones of the feet or the hands of the lower arms not the spine and the hips the usual source of most osteoporosis fractures. So if you have a person who has osteoporosis, they probably  Shouldn't take these agents.  Finally, I should mention these Agents come combined with metformin and with a sulfonylurea called Amaryl and therefore avandia is available as a Van Dam it and a Van de menthe is a drug combining 500 milligrams of Metformin with 2 4 or 8 milligrams of avandia.  The amount of Metformin in those agents could be either a 500 or a thousand milligrams pill so you can end up taking one pill twice a day and have a very significant blood sugar lowering and it's used to great deal in patients who have a high A1C that is high blood sugars. And you need more than one drug to get them down to their goal level. That's when you would consider a combined agent.  Another combination is a combination of avandia and a sulfonylurea Amaryl or glue glimepiride.  And a van derail comes as a for milligram of avandia with 122 milligrams of Amarillo or four milligrams of avandia with four milligrams of Amarillo.  This combined agent taken twice a day very effectively reduces blood sugar. But in this case can cause hypoglycemia because the sulfonylurea Amaryl does produce hypoglycemia.  They also can cause fluid retention and lead to some fractures in women as well.\",\n",

The only concentration of insulin available in the United States is 100 units. Per milliliter a milliliter is equal to a cubic centimeter. All insulin syringes are graduated to match this concentration.  Insulin syringes are available in various volumes, for example, 3/10 CC which would hold a maximum dose of 30 units 1/2 cc to hold a maximum dose of 50 units and one cc to hold a maximum dose of 100 units.  Some insulins are cloudy suspensions to ensure uniform dispersion of the insulin in the Cloudy suspension roll the vial gently between your hands avoid vigorous shaking which will produce air bubbles or foam and interfere with obtaining the accurate dose.

I try to do a lot of research for these videos and I came across  Statistic this week, while researching for this particular video that just blew me away. I mean, I really, really had no idea that this statistic was as bad as it was a shocking 9 out of 10 people who have pre-diabetes, don't know, they have it. I was one of those 9y. Well, almost all medical journals. I have researched on this topic, have concluded that in general terms.  Prediabetes has no symptoms. However, dr. Ashida Gupta says, if you have certain signs of type 2 diabetes in a less severe form, you could have a diagnosis before it becomes type 2. So if you experience any of the following, just one of them, it would be a good idea for you. To ask your doctor to check your blood glucose.  A blurry vision, sudden spikes and dips in your blood sugar which are common in those with pre-diabetes. Can impair your eyes ability to bend and focus leading to blurred vision according to dr. Gupta. The blurriness should go away. Once you get your sugar levels back into normal range.  Excessive thirst one or more well-known signs of pre-diabetes and diabetes is excessive thirst and it occurs in response to the Surplus sugar. In the blood, your body attempts to flush the excess into the urine, which means you'll need to go more often than usual this in turn can cause dehydration making you feel thirsty. Stubborn wounds or infections, high blood sugar can slow your circulation.  So skin takes longer to repair itself. As a result, minor bruises and cuts might take longer than usual to heal. The condition can also promote the growth of bacteria and fungi, which may lead to repeat infections, especially of the skin or vagina like urinary tract infections.  Extreme fatigue, your body uses blood sugar for fuel, but pre diabetes causes insulin resistance, which means your body isn't able to effectively convert the glucose in your blood into energy. This is leaves you with severe fatigue and sometimes even flu-like symptoms.  Sudden unexplained weight gain or loss when the body is unable to get the energy. It needs from blood glucose. It starts burning other things for fuel resulting in weight loss. Even if you're not on a diet or working out, on the other hand, insulin resistance can make you feel hungry, which can cause weight gain.  And darkened areas of skin, high insulin levels can speed the rate at which skin cells reproduce leading to a condition called acanthosis. Nigricans.  It occurs when the scan on the back of the neck under the arm or in the creases of your elbows, begin to darken, maybe even your knuckles and they take on a smooth or velvety feeling. If you feel you've experienced any of these signs, I suggest you make an appointment with your healthcare provider and tell them you have a concern about diabetes. You should then be given at the very least, a glucose screening and hopefully even an A1C test.  You may not have anything, but what's the harm in a small test to find out?

Such as eight hundred, two 1800 calories per day meal plans, diabetes meal, planning tips and tricks. And there are also tons of diabetes friendly recipes for everyone.  Now, this is a great question and I have thought of several ways to approach it. But I've narrowed it down to two. I will first. Look at why it is important for you to know and then why it is important for others to know as well? First. Let's define what pre-diabetes is and is not diabetes is defined as having a fasting plasma blood, glucose level of 126 milligrams per deciliter or greater on two separate occasions.  Occasions if diabetes symptoms exist and you have a casual blood glucose taken, at any time that is equal to, or greater than 200 mg, and a second Test shows the same high blood glucose level. Then you have diabetes, in general, people who have a fasting plasma glucose in the 100 to 125. Rains are defined as having impaired fasting glucose. Now, if your  Doctor gives you an oral glucose tolerance test and at two hours, your blood glucose is 142. 199, you have impaired glucose tolerance. Now, either of these is a medical terminology for what your doctor is referring to. When he says you have pre-diabetes, now the foremost authority in my opinion on anything diabetes-related is the Joslin Diabetes Center and they offer this piece of advice.  Sure to ask your doctor, what your exact blood sugar test results are when he tells you that you have pre-diabetes. Some Physicians are not as familiar as they should be with the new National guidelines for diagnosing diabetes. They may be telling you, you have pre-diabetes when in fact you have actual diabetes. So to answer the question, the main reason, I think you need to know if you have prediabetes is so that you can take steps necessary.  Terry to hopefully keep it from becoming diabetes. This is the main reason why anyone should know if they have pre-diabetes, who is at a higher risk of having prediabetes. Well, according to the Joslin Diabetes, Center among those, who should be screened for pre diabetes, include overweight, adults, aged 45 and older. And those under age 45 who are overweight and who have one or more of the following risk factors, habitually physically, inactive have  And previously been identified as having impaired fasting, glucose or impaired glucose tolerance have a family, history of diabetes, are members of a certain ethnic group, Asian Americans, African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Native Americans have had gestational diabetes or have given birth to a child weighing more than nine pounds have had elevated blood pressure, have an HDL cholesterol level the good.  Cholesterol of 35 or lower and or triglyceride level of 250 or higher have had polycystic ovary syndrome and have a history of vascular disease. Now, if you fall Within These categories, you should be screened as soon as possible. Then you can get a plan together to prevent any further damage. I also think your family and friends should know that you have pre-diabetes. They can be a great source of support and comfort.  In this lifestyle change and it will take place one way or another. There will be a chain, but most of all, if you do find out you have pre-diabetes, there is good news. There are two key factors to anyone having diabetes. If you have the right diet and physical activity, you with pre-diabetes can prevent it from becoming diabetes and some of the ill effects that comes from the disease.

       " \"Studies dating back nearly a century noted a striking. Finding if you take young healthy people split them up into two groups, half on a fat Rich diet and half on a carb Rich diet within just two days. This is what happens. The glucose intolerance skyrockets in the fat group in response to the same sugar challenge, the group that had been shoveling in fat and it up with twice, the blood sugar as the amount of fat in the diet goes up. So does our blood sugar spikes? Why would eating fat lead to higher blood sugar levels? It would take scientists nearly seven decades to unravel this mystery, but it would end up holding the key to our current understanding of the cause of type 2 diabetes.  The reason athletes carb load before a race is to build up the fuel supply within their muscles, right? We break down the starch into glucose in our digestive tract. It circulates as blood glucose, also known as blood sugar and it's taken up by our muscles to be stored and burned for energy. Blood sugar though is like a vampire needs an invitation to come into ourselves. And that invitation is insulin. Here's a muscle cell. Here's some blood sugar outside, waiting patiently to.  Come in insulin is the key that unlocks the door to let sugar in our blood enter the muscle cell when insulin attaches to the insulin receptor. It activates an enzyme which activates another enzyme, which activates two more enzymes with finally activates glucose transport, which acts as a Gateway for glucose to enter the cell. So insulin is the key that unlocks the door into our muscle cells.  What if there was no insulin though? Well, blood sugar will be stuck on the bloodstream, banging on the door to our muscles, and not be able to get inside. And so with nowhere to go, sugar levels would rise and Rise. That's what happens. In type 1 diabetes, the cells in the pancreas that make insulin get destroyed and without insulin sugar. In the blood can't get out of the blood into the muscles and blood sugar Rises. But there's a second way, we could end up with high blood sugar. What if there's enough?  Insulin, but the insulin doesn't work. The key is there but something, something's gummed up the lock. This is called insulin resistance. Our muscle cells become resistant to the effect of insulin. What's gumming up the door, locks and our muscle cells preventing insulin, from letting sugar in fat, what's called intra, Maya, cellular lipid, fat inside our muscle cells.  Fat in the bloodstream can build up inside the muscle cell creating toxic fatty breakdown products and free radicals, that can block the signaling pathway process. So no matter how much insulin we have out in our blood. It's not able to open the glucose Gates and blood sugar levels. Build up in the blood. This mechanism by which fat induces insulin resistance wasn't known until fancy. MRI techniques were developed to see what was happening. Inside people's muscles.  As fat was infused into their bloodstream, that's how we found out that elevation of fat levels in the blood causes insulin resistance, by the inhibition of glucose transport into the muscles. And this can happen within three hours. One hit of fat can start causing insulin resistance. Inhibiting glucose uptake after just 160 minutes.  Same thing happens to teens you, infuse fat into their bloodstream. It builds up in their muscles and decreases, their insulin sensitivity showing that increased fat in the blood is an important contributor of insulin resistance and then you can do the opposite experiment, lower the level of fat and people's blood and the insulin resistance comes right down, clear the fat out of the blood and you can clear the sugar out of the blood, so that explains  This finding on a high fat. Ketogenic diet, insulin doesn't work very well, our bodies become insulin resistant. But as the amount of fat in our diet gets lower and lower insulin works better and better.  This is a clear demonstration that the sugar tolerance of even healthy individuals can be impaired by administering. A low-carb high-fat diet, but we can decrease insulin resistance by decreasing fat intake.\",\n",

According to the Mayo Clinic metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions, which does include high blood sugar, but also increased blood pressure.  Excess body fat around the waist and abnormal cholesterol or triglycerides levels that all occur together, which increase your risk of heart disease stroke and your risk of diabetes. Having just one of these conditions doesn't mean you have metabolic syndrome. However, any of these conditions increase your risk of serious disease and having more than one of these, might increase your risk even more. Now, an underlying cause of metabolic.  Is insulin resistance, which is a condition that increases the chances of developing pre diabetes, Diabetes Type 2 and other cardiovascular diseases. So an understanding of the interaction of insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome. And pre-diabetes, I think is critical to making the lifestyle changes that can help you avoid, type, 2, diabetes, and many other health problems. You see, food is broken down in the body into glucose.  It's the simple sugar. That is the main source of energy for our bodies. It is digested into many different macromolecules protein, fat carbohydrates. Then carbohydrates are broken down further into glucose, which is a simple energy used by cells for fuel. Now, insulin allows this glucose to leave the bloodstream into the cells where it can be used as fuel. And the activities of that set up your pancreas makes sense.  Treats insulin, the glucose can't enter the cells if your pancreas doesn't manufacture enough insulin or your sales are unable to process, the insulin that is present in the bloodstream as a result glucose levels become elevated, which sets the stage for pre-diabetes and type 2 sheet issues with too much fat produce fewer insulin receptors, and they're more resistant to insulin in a vicious cycle. The pancreas  Responds by pumping more insulin into the insulin-producing cells that die from exhaustion type 2 diabetes in Sue's. Now when you are insulin resistant, your muscle fat and liver cells do not use insulin properly. The pancreas tries to keep up with the demand for insulin by producing more eventually. The pancreas cannot keep up with the body's need for insulin causing excess glucose to build up in the blood straight.  Many people with insulin resistance have high levels of both blood glucose and Insulin circulating in their blood at the same time. So that is an underlying cause for Syndrome X or the metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes means that you have a higher risk of developing type 2. Diabetes Studies have shown that most people with pre-diabetes, go on to develop type 2 within 10 years unless  They make changes to their weight, their diet, and their levels of physical activity. So while both pre diabetes, diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome have insulin resistance as an underlying, cause they are not the same thing as we stated earlier Syndrome X or the metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions added together pre-diabetes, and the insulin resistance that occurs.  Because of metabolic syndrome does not mean that they are the same thing at all.

       " \"Hello, I'm Tom Mason of the diabetes Council.com researcher writer and I have type 2 diabetes Now. I want to emphasize that my perspective is coming from one with type 2 and not type 1 diabetes. Our channel is primarily for those with type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes today. I want to answer the question. What is postprandial blood?  Koko's and why should people with pre-diabetes know about it?  After you watch the video today, I invite you to check out the description box for my new ebook. This is one of the most comprehensive diabetes meal planning books. You can find anywhere it contains diabetes friendly meals and recipes recipes for different goals such as eight hundred two 1800 calories per day meal plans diabetes meal planning tips and tricks. There are also tons of diabetes friendly recipes for everyone.  There are a lot of big terms out there aren't there and you really need to know what some of those terms are and why they are important one such term postprandial blood glucose.  Now the term postprandial glucose might sound like jargon but it literally means sugar after the meal. So what we are talking about here is the blood glucose reading at about one to two hours after a large meal. Now that part is pretty simple to answer but why should you know what that number is? Well, some of you with pre-diabetes are checking your blood sugar in the mornings some might not be  Really depends on your control and want your doctor thinks is best. But if you're only testing first thing in the morning, you might be missing the full picture in my research. I came across an interesting article in everyday Health some of what I'm about to say about PPG or postprandial glucose is from that article. You see the first morning glucose level check is usually the lowest of the day and checking only in the morning is kind of like  It purposefully blindfolding yourself to only see the best case scenario. If you want to see a more complete picture mix it up check your glucose level at various times during the day. Now the Ada of the American Diabetes Association recommends checking the blood sugar levels before eating that's a fasting blood sugar and then again one to two hours after the beginning of the meal which is postprandial glucose.  Now particularly do this if the target A1C goals aren't being met the test after the meal called the postprandial glucose test. You might need to test your blood sugar at other times during the day or after certain activities depending on the information you and your medical team are trying to put together. You see that test is very very important to see what meals are doing especially certain meals to your plug.  glucose now those PPG numbers are affected by number variables including what you eat how active you are your insulin sensitivity and how quickly food moves through your stomach the postprandial glucose gives us information about how the body is able to manage the blood glucose after a meal it informs us that blood glucose has returned to normal or if it's up or down after the meal intake now when blood sugar spikes after meals and  Stays High. Well that could make a difficult for you to achieve your A1C and other blood sugar control goals. Now that's according to guidelines published by the American Association of clinical Endocrinology. Just if your A1C continues to be higher than your target goal your chance of developing complications increases, especially your chance of developing type two. So the PPG can help troubleshoot those problems.  By measuring your postprandial glucose, you can determine whether dietary modifications or pre-meal bolus insulin is needed to reduce these spikes. Now if you have pre-diabetes, that's probably not going to happen. But if you achieve your Premier glucose targets, but your A1C remains above Target, then you really need to monitor that very very closely and talk to your doctor about it learning how to count carbs can help you achieve your PP goals  Herbs contribute significantly more to your postprandial glucose then fat and protein and so checking it regularly can help you figure out the best balance of carbs fats and proteins. Now, I know this is a lot to take in and for some of you your doctor is not having you take a postprandial glucose, but at some point you make so I hope that this has been informative for you.

       " \"Neuropathy or damage to the nerves is a debilitating disorder. Diabetes is by far the most common cause up to fifty percent of diabetics will eventually develop neuropathy during the course of their disease. It can be very painful and the pain is frequently resistant to Conventional treatments. In fact, there are currently considered no effective treatment for diabetic neuropathy clinicians rely on steroids opiates and antidepressants to try to mediate the suffering. Twenty years ago a remarkable study was published on the regression of diabetic neuropathy with a plant-based diet. There are two types of diabetic neuropathy a relatively painless type characterized by numbness tingling and pins and needle Sensations and then a second form which is painful with burning or aching Sensations to the point of excruciating lancinating stabbing pain this study concentrated on the painful type xxi.  Excel frame with moderate or Worse symptomatic painful neuropathy for up to 10 years were placed on a whole food plant-based diet along with a half hour of walking everyday years and years of suffering and then complete relief of pain and 17 of the 21 patients within days.  Numbness noticeably improved to and the side effects were all good. They lost 10 pounds blood sugar's got better insulin. He's dropped in half and in five of the patients not only apparently was their painful neuropathy cured so was their diabetes normal blood sugars off of all medications and their triglycerides and cholesterol improved to high blood pressures got better. In fact gone in about half the hypertensives and 80% drop overall in the need for high blood pressure medications within three weeks.  Now this was a live in program where patients meals were provided what happened when they were sent home the 17 folks were followed for years in an all except one the relief from the painful neuropathy continued or improved even farther. How'd they get that kind of compliance pain and ill-health are strong motivating factors.  One of the most painful and frustrating conditions to treat in all of medicine and 75 percent cured in a couple days with a natural non-toxic. In fact beneficial treatment a diet composed of whole plant Foods, how could nerve damage be reversed? So suddenly it wasn't necessarily the Improvement in blood sugar control since it took about 10 days for the diet to control the diabetes. Where's the pain was gone in as few as four days.  There are several mechanisms by which a total vegetarian diet Works to alleviate the problem of diabetic neuropathy as well as the diabetic condition itself. The most interesting speculation was that it could be the trans fats naturally found in meat and dairy and refined vegetable oils that could be causing an inflammatory response. They found a significant percentage of the fat found under the skin of those who ate meat or dairy consisted of trans fats. Whereas those on a strictly Whole Food plant-based.  Had none, they stuck needles in the buttocks of people eating different diets and nine months or more on a strict plant-based diet appeared to remove the trans fat from their bodies or at least their butts, but their pain didn't take nine months to get better got better in days. So more likely it was due to an improvement in blood flow nerve biopsies and diabetics with severe Progressive neuropathy of shown small vessel disease within the nerve there.  Our blood vessels within our nerves that can get clogged up the oxygen levels in the nerves of diabetics was found to be lower than even that of deoxygenated blood this lack of oxygen within the nerve may arise from blockages within the blood vessels depriving the nerve of oxygen presumably leading them to cry out in pain within days though improvements in blood rheology the ease of blood flow on a plant-based diet May.  A prominent role in the reversal of diabetic neuropathy plant-based diets may also lower the level of igf-1 inside the eyeballs of diabetics and decrease the risk of retinopathy diabetic vision loss as well. But the most efficient way to avoid diabetic complications is to eliminate the diabetes and this is often feasible for those type 2 patients who make an abiding commitment to daily exercise and a healthy enough diet.  Since the initial report of neuropathy reversal, the results have been replicated significant improvements and numbness and burning. Why didn't I learn about this in medical school the neglect of this important work by the broader medical community is nothing short of unconscionable.\",\n",
       " \"The everyone with diabetes counts program funded by the centers for Medicare and Medicaid services offers no-cost, diabetes self-management education classes for people with pre-diabetes and diabetes. Learn from a class graduate and a practice manager about their experiences with this program. Good morning. This is Pat. I'm here with Tony who participated in the diabetes self-management agent education course, we offer here in Lawrence.  Just about a year ago and Sufi way the practice manager who is engaging her Medicare and dual eligible patients with diabetes or pre-diabetes to attend class.  Well, I learned through it too. So and God, do you? And the reason is just that I'm looking for classes like this, so to attend. So when classes do come up soon and Doctor you will tell me and give me the information how to attend the classes.  I have diabetes and it's very important to me to give educated on it. And that's why I attended the classes education. I learned how to eat. I learned how to read the labels. The class was excellent for me.  This will be important like yourself. You came across, you were very understanding when we were going too fast. You're slowed us down or going to slow your speed us up so that you know, the instructors were very important to the class.  It it's made a big impact because at one point my sugar was out of control. My diabetes was out of control and I felt that after the class I can maintain it. Well, one of them is when I made a meal like a breakfast and what would happen is I would I would just make my regular breakfast and then we put it on the board and it showed how much I was over.  You know what the Cubs and the facts and everything, the cow everything.  Then to the class, I learned how to make a man.  And I had the book that was a book and into us. So we knew exactly what meal to make.  And how to keep it within its range.  And it worked perfect. Well when you hear other people talk and there was one gentleman that he had his own physical issues and he came to the class and he came to the class to get educated on Diabetes to educate his son, who was dealing with diabetes.  Well, the value is that patients learn and they're engaged and they're educated Panic, put some ownership on them for controlling their diabetes because we can sit and dictate do this, do that. Take your medicine. Eat this your A1C level needs to be that but if you don't help them learn how to manage their disease, they go home and they don't know what to do. So, this class, I saw people that thought they knew a lot about diabetes, who came to me afterwards and said, wow, I didn't really know anything, and now I know what a carbohydrate is. And now,  Know how many carbs I can eat and I didn't realize that I couldn't have two bowls of rice instead of you know, and have a blood sugar in a normal range. So I think it really empowered the patients to take control of their disease process. Getting the doctors involved because I think there's no better word to a patient than a doctor recommending something. The next best is the nurse to recommend it and just playing it up of how beneficial it is and that they're going to take some control and that we  Courage that to all work together as a team to get the success and the benefit of what we want and the goal of that are controlled. Diabetes is a team effort. It's not just the patient. It's not just the doctor. It's not just the medications. It's everything, combined of a team effort. And I think the biggest thing for us getting people here was to have it at the office because people are comfortable here. They're not going to a strange place. They were, you know, excited to tell us things about the class after  The class ended for the day and it just worked having it here. If there were any questions, we were available to help with the instructors or with the patients.  Well, I don't see why anybody should have any misgivings. I mean.  Everybody needs help. Everybody needs education. It's a service that's free to the patient's. They come in and they learn and they benefit from it. And you know, it empowers them and what better way than to have everybody as a team help control. I don't know why anybody would be opposed to having somebody come and help educate their patients. Just would not make any sense.  Classes are taught by two trains leaders using the Stanford University.

       " 'This video will teach you how to inject your insulin using a syringe.  Please watch the entire video before injecting your insulin.  Your healthcare provider May recommend that you inject insulin using a syringe to help you control your blood sugar level injecting, insulin with a syringe involves choosing an injection site, preparing the syringe and insulin and then injecting the insulin into your body.  Your healthcare provider will tell you what type of insulin you need as well as when and how much you need to inject.  You will need alcohol, wipes, your bottle of insulin.  A new syringe for each injection.  And a Sharps disposal container to throw away. The used syringes.  A disposable syringe has the following parts a barrel.  A plunger.  A needle cap.  And a needle, selecting the injection site.  Before injecting your insulin select the injection site on your body, the areas for insulin injection, include the abdomen, or belly upper arms, the thighs, and the buttocks. When selecting the injection site, be sure you use a different spot. Each time. You give yourself an injection.  Leave at least one inch away from the last injection spot.  Inject your insulin at least 2 inches from your belly button.  And choose a spot. One inch or farther away from any SCAR or mole.  Preparing the syringe and Insulin Step 1, wash your hands with soap and water and then dry them.  Step 2. If your insulin needs to be mixed gently, roll the bottle between your hands. Do not shake the bottle because it may cause bubbles to form in your insulin.  Before injecting yourself, check the insulin in the bottle to make sure it is the type of insulin, your doctor prescribed for you.  Not past the expiration date.  And the insulin is free of clumps.  Step 3, remove the cap from your insulin bottle. Use an alcohol wipe to clean the rubber stopper, on the top of the bottle.  Step 4, remove the syringe from its package. Be sure to use a new syringe each time you inject insulin.  Step 5, remove the needle cap from the syringe.  Do not touch the needle or allow it to touch any surface and do not use the syringe. If the needle is bent, some syringes have a cap over the plunger that you may need to remove as well.  Step 6, pull back the plunger to draw in an amount of air that is equal to your insulin dose.  Step 7. Hold your insulin bottle securely on a flat surface. Push the needle, through the rubber, on the top of the bottle, push the plunger to inject the air into the insulin bottle.  Leave the needle in the bottle, this helps to keep the right amount of pressure in the bottle and makes it easier to draw insulin into the syringe.  Step 8 with the needle. Still in the bottle, turn the bottle and syringe upside down.  Step 9, pull back the plunger to fill the syringe with just a little more than the insulin dose you need. If you see air bubbles tap, the barrel of the syringe with your finger, to make them rise to the top slowly push in the plunger, just enough to push out the air and extra insulin.  Step 10 carefully. Check to make sure the amount of insulin in the syringe matches your insulin dose.  Pull the needle out of the bottle and carefully. Lay the syringe on a flat clean surface.  Make sure the needle does not touch anything.  Injecting the insulin.  Step 1, clean your injection, site with an alcohol wipe, use a circular motion to clean. A spot about 2 inches wide. Step to pinch. A two inch fold of skin in the cleaned injection spot. Step 3, hold the syringe, like a pencil and quickly. Insert the needle straight into your skin at a 90 degree angle. Make sure the whole needle, enters your skin.  Step 4. Push the plunger all the way down to inject the insulin into the fat tissue beneath your skin, slowly count to five. Before, removing the needle, to make sure you have injected, all of the insulin step 5, pull the needle, straight out to remove it.  Step 6 throw away the syringe into your Sharps disposal container never throw your syringes or needles directly into the trash contact. Your healthcare provider.

What can you do if your blood sugar gets really high? I mean you need to bring it down because you can really be in trouble. Well extremely high blood sugar levels can be dangerous and they can cause lasting Health complications. Remember if you ever have blood sugar readings that  In high for more than 24 hours without coming down and after an effort has been made to lower them. You need to call your health care provider immediately. That being said we've all had those days when we get a random high blood sugar reading and we're not sure what caused it or we forget to give insulin or we eat a delicious dessert without realizing how much sugar is actually in it. We've all been there for whatever reason those out of the ordinary high blood sugar readings happen and need to be  treated no need to rush to the doctor for every high blood sugar reading though. There are some simple steps. You can take to lower your blood sugar fast. The following can help most people bring down their blood sugar to an acceptable level. However, if you have any questions about how to bring down your blood glucose, it's important to talk to your healthcare provider. They know your situation much better than I do and can give you a plan of attack for high blood sugar, but for everyone else the first thing we need to  It was watch for signs of high blood sugar, you know, the feeling extreme thirst sluggishness nausea blurred vision a downright sick feeling and your family or friends may tell you that extreme irritability is a major sign. You need to check your blood sugar to see if it's high. Well the best thing to do is Catch it before it gets really high or it will be harder to bring down quickly causing havoc on your blood sugar readings for days. Now if you do not take insulin as part of your treatment plan.  And these tips will show you how to lower your blood sugar fast. If you take insulin, you will first want to give the appropriate amount of insulin to correct the blood sugar. However, insulin still take some time to take effect before Bringing Down the blood sugar. So these tips will help you feel a bit better in the meantime insulin is the medication that will bring down blood glucose the fastest someone who uses mealtime insulin can take correction doses to lower blood glucose. This requires a thorough understanding.  I think however of when to inject how often to give correction Doses and how much insulin to use you'll need to work with your doctor or diabetes instructor to learn how to do this. Well, that being said, I have three major tips that will help you lower your blood sugar fast. First of all hydrate, the more water you drink the better drink at least two glasses of water immediately one right after the other water will help flush out your system and stabilize the glucose in your  Your bloodstream according to David Spiro who's an RN and a contributor to WebMD quote for people with diabetes. The risk of dehydration is greater because higher than normal blood glucose depletes fluids to get rid of the glucose the kidneys will try to pass it out in the urine, but that takes water so the higher your blood glucose the more fluids you should drink which is why thirst is one of the main symptoms of diabetes. So number one hydrate number two.  Exercise exercise is a good way to get better blood sugar control and keep your blood sugar levels in a healthy range is part of your routine management, but exercise can also help lower blood sugar when it is excessively High by getting your heart pumping. It's your blood flowing what uses up the glucose in your bloodstream faster. It will also get your endorphins going which will help your body start to feel better soon. Try to keep your heart rate up for at least 10 to 15 minutes. Check your  blood sugar intermittently to prevent it from rebounding too low and your attempts to stabilize it if your blood sugar's have been so high that you have high ketones in your blood a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis that could happen. So you do not exercise because it could actually drive your blood sugar even higher. You also need to eat a protein snack protein acts as a blood sugar stabilizer and can slow the absorption rate of  Goes one of the symptoms of high blood sugar is increased hunger. So this can help satisfy that craving while helping lower the blood sugar at the same time now, don't grab a snack. That's a lot of sugar along with the protein. You just be defeating the purpose of it good sources of protein include a tablespoon of no sugar added peanut butter or an ounce of cheese. Just don't overdo it the most important thing you can do for your health and your diabetes is to pay close attention to how you feel whenever you feel like  Like something is out of whack. It probably is. So test your blood sugar and do something about it in the long run.

       " \"Soon autoimmune disease is this special sort of disease where your own immune cells have gone Rogue and start to attack your own cells, right? Hepatitis happens to mean, inflammation of the liver. So it's reasonable to say that autoimmune hepatitis. Is this resulting inflammation of your liver tissue because they're being attacked by your own immune cells.  Like many autoimmune diseases, the root cause of autoimmune. Hepatitis is ultimately not super clear. But some researchers think it's a combination of environmental triggers and genetic predisposition.  It tends to occur most often in young women in the female to male ratio is about four. To one, also though, an important piece of the genetic puzzle is the human leukocyte antigen system shortened to HLA, which is this location of genes on chromosome, 6 that regulate our immune functions specifically these genes control, the proteins that are encoded and used on the cells. Surface to present foreign molecules to the immune system, but although they present antigens there. Also,  Form of antigen themselves. They aren't though the same type of antigen as one on an infectious molecule, but actually a low antigens that vary from person to person and are actually specific self proteins.  Usually, our thymus makes sure that the T cells that attack these self proteins aren't allowed to survive in autoimmune disease. There may be some abnormality associated with specific self proteins. That lets the T cells attack them.  Based on studying people with autoimmune hepatitis. They often have HLA DDR3 and ddr4 which are both MHC Class 2 surface receptors the Dr. Part refers to its location on the chromosome. For example, depending on the location. You could have hlaa, hla-b HLA, C, or HLA D, and HLA DS3 sub-regions. P q and R. So this one is HLA Dr.  So specifically with autoimmune hepatitis, there seems to be some sort of connection between these particular self proteins, the HLA Dr. And mounting an attack against your own liver.  Autoimmune. Hepatitis also tends to be associated with other diseases like Hashimoto's thyroiditis where your immune cells attack, your thyroid and Graves disease where your thyroid over produces thyroid hormones.  Clinically autoimmune, hepatitis patients can sit anywhere on a spectrum from completely asymptomatic to cirrhosis and fulminant. Hepatitis also known as acute liver failure or they might be somewhere in between with debilitating symptoms like fever jaundice, and hepatosplenomegaly a condition where both the spleen and the liver are way larger than their normal size. Probably caused by inflammation, due to immune cell attack.  Also, for symptomatic patients, will be this increase in blood transaminases. Usually, there's only a small amount of transaminases in the blood which are these enzymes that help. Metabolize amino acids, alanine aminotransferase or alt is mostly found only in the liver and aspartate aminotransferase or AST is found in both the liver as well as other tissues. So if the liver cells are damaged by immune cells, both, alt and AST start leaking out into the  the blood from the liver, but typically since alt is more associated with the liver, alt will be higher than a St. Even though they both will likely be elevated autoimmune. Hepatitis can be split into two types. Type 1 is the most common accounting for about 80% of autoimmune, hepatitis cases and is characterized by several lab findings. First. We'll look for antibodies to your own nuclei that are floating around in your blood. We also call these anti-nuclear antibodies or anacs.  And these antibodies have failed to be able to tell the difference between self and non-self. And so the end up being against the proteins in the nuclei of your own cells. Also along the same lines. We might find antibodies that are targeting your own smooth muscle, proteins as well. Decreased serum. Albumin is also a marker for autoimmune, hepatitis and damage to the liver. Usually serum. Albumin is produced in the liver. But if the liver becomes damaged serum albumin production, May decrease,  Finally an elevated, or prolonged Prothrombin time, which is the time. It takes your blood to clot is a typical lab finding in more severe cases.  Time to autoimmune. Hepatitis is way less common and is defined by the presence of antibodies to the microsomes of the liver or your kidney, a lkm one or two, a liver cytosol antigen ALC one. This type is most common in young girls and usually happens alongside another autoimmune disease.  As to treatment, initially patients can be given immunosuppressant medications. They may be given corticosteroids which help inhibit the immune responses that are mediated by both B and T cells.  Another drug, azathioprine has a similar immunosuppressant action and inhibits an enzyme that we need to synthesize DNA and so it's strongly inhibit cells, like T cells and B cells that proliferate a lot during an immune response. The patients are resistant to these drug therapies. They might have to undergo a liver transplant.\",\n",
       " \"If a doctor is concerned that a patient either has diabetes or is at risk from diabetes. They might suggest an A1C test to be performed. And what I want to do in this video is one, just explore what A1C even means. And also how that actually relates to diabetes or a high or the site of the main side effect of diabetes, which is having high blood sugar or hyperglycemia. So to do that, let's think about, let's think about red blood cells and I know what you're King, what does this have to do with diabetes? And we'll get there in a little bit. So red blood cells are the main oxygen carriers in our blood. They kind of look like these. Like these lozenges and inside of red blood cells, you have hundreds of millions of hemoglobin molecules hemoglobin proteins. Let me draw some hemoglobin proteins. You actually have the number. I found is two to three hundred million / /, red, blood cell. And then we have tens of trillions of red blood cells. We have a lot of hemoglobin in  Has and hemoglobin is what makes red blood cells red when hemoglobin is bound to oxygen. It has a red color. So this right here each of those are hemoglobin protein hemoglobin. Now, it turns out that hemoglobin. Let me draw a bigger version of it hemoglobin if it has some glucose around. So let me draw some glucose floating around near the hemoglobin. If it has some glucose around, there is some chance. It's not a high probability, but there's  Chance of the hemoglobin and the glucose bump into each other, at just the right way that they'll buy, they'll bind to each other. And so you'll have this situation where you have glucose bound to the hemoglobin. Now this, this this hemoglobin with a glucose bound to it, is called glycated hemoglobin gly, glycated hemoglobin. I wrote glycated in green for because I'm using  green for the for the glucose. So glycated hemoglobin and another name for glycated hemoglobin or hemoglobin that has some glucose bound to. It is hemoglobin A1c. Hemoglobin.  A1C. And now I can imagine things are starting to click in your brain when you are measuring your A1C levels. That's a test of the percentage of your hemoglobin. That is hemoglobin A1c. So you take a blood test. They're measuring the relative to the total amount of hemoglobin there. How, what percentage of that is hemoglobin, is hemoglobin A1c and a normal range of that. So, if you just have normal blood sugar over a  The bull amount of time you're going to have a hemoglobin A1c level in kind of the for four to six percent range and people are still kind of trying to tighten up these ranges and it doesn't completely correlate a tightly with blood sugar. It does correlate, but there's still people with the same blood sugar can still have fairly different A1C levels, but four to six percent is considered normal is considered normal. And if you have higher higher than seven or  or eight percent so greater than seven to eight percent. So, if you had a, like an A1C level of nine or ten percent, that's high, that's high. And so you can imagine this is kind of a proxy for how much glucose you have in your bloodstream because the more glucose that you have in your bloodstream, the the higher the probability that that glucose is going to react with the actual hemoglobin so that you're going to have a higher percentage of hemoglobin A1c. And the other reason why this is useful, it's kind of like  You can see on the first pass, it's useful because it's not one of these snapshot test. Everything we've talked about so far, with respect to diabetes is taking your blood sugar at any one point in time. And we know that your blood sugar changes throughout the day it changes depending on how active you are changes, depending on what you might have. Just eaten. So when you take, when you do blood sugar, you're just getting a sample. You don't know what the blood sugar is throughout the damage. You just kept sampling it, which could get a pretty annoying keep, you know, keep freaking your needle with A1c.  This starts to become a measure of how much glucose you have in your blood over a longer period of time. And in general is kind of used as a measure for the last few months because the red blood cells and the hemoglobin in them. They have a lifespan of about 120 days, 120 Day, Life Span. Now that obviously doesn't mean that all of your hemoglobin gets produced on one day and then I'll dies 120 days later. You have some red blood cells and hemoglobin. That might be a few seconds.  Then you have some that might be approaching 120 days old. So on average they're going to be about 60 days older about two months old. So when you're measuring this percentage, you're you're definitely not getting the percentage of anything older than 120 days. And on average you're seeing things that are from about two months old. So the higher this percentage, this is saying, wow, things, you know, my average, my average hemoglobin molecule in my body is only maybe 60 days old at this point and already seven to eight percent of them seven to eight percent.  None of them have already been glycated, which is an indicator that I probably have more blood sugar than a normal person. In a normal situation. Only four to six percent of, of my of my hemoglobin would get glycated. So, hopefully that explains what A1C is. And, but I do want to say, you know, and I said at the beginning, the video, I'm not a Doctrine. And even if even amongst doctors, the A1C test or the A1C measurement, it's a little bit there. It's a there's there's some debate about how useful.  Is whether what, what it's measuring or kind of how far back it actually is a good view at kind of your glucose levels. And also, as I mentioned to people with the exact same blood sugars could have different A1C levels depending on other things, how old they are or whether they have some other type of medical condition.\",\n",
       " \"Diagnosed. Let's look at what these numbers are and what they mean, blood glucose readings, checking your blood sugar, knowing what the numbers mean is very important in regards to taking blood glucose readings, if you know everything about getting the numbers, but don't know why or what they mean. You're wasting your time and effort knowing if your blood sugar is too high or too low or just, right? Is vital in treating.  Diabetes. Now, you were diagnosed with pre-diabetes because of these numbers, you were diagnosed with pre-diabetes because of these numbers. Your fasting blood glucose level was between 100 and 125 on two separate readings. This is the amount of glucose that was present in your blood after a time of not eating normal, blood glucose levels are less than 100. Now, you are shooting for a fasting blood.  Travel between 80 and 120 before each meal, which is called pre prandial, a postprandial reading, should be less than 180. Now, reading of less than 80 is considered hypoglycemic. This means your blood glucose level is getting too low. In this case. You will need to get some carbs in your system. The recommended amount if carbs is 15 grams and then check your blood sugar again. Now,  If your fasting blood glucose level is too high, especially before eating saying that 180 range. You may need to take a fast acting insulin to help bring it down. This all depends on whether your doctor has actually prescribed insulin for you or not. Probably not with prediabetes, but this should be discussed with your doctor and is one of the reasons taking blood sugar readings, are so important. Now a test that will  Occur at the doctor's office and not at home is called the A1C. Test A1C is used to diagnose, diabetes and used as an indicator to help manage the disease. The A1C test is a blood test that provides information about a person's average levels of blood glucose called blood sugar over the past three months. Now, you may hear your doctor called the A1C. It's also sometimes called a hemoglobin A1c.  See, or an hba1c or a glycohemoglobin test, most people use A1C. Now specifically, the A1C test measures the percentage of your hemoglobin that is coated with sugar. Hemoglobin is a protein in red, blood cells that carries oxygen. If you have a high A1C then you aren't controlling your blood sugar very well. This has the potential to cause more diabetic related problems.  Where the A1C is a better indicator of how you're controlling your blood sugar over simply testing, once or twice a day is the A1C, looks at your average over three months. You may take your levels at the same time each day, say as soon as you get out of bed and your blood sugar reading, maybe 120 or even better. But as the day goes on your levels, may increase with the consumption of meals, lack of exercise and other factors. You are under the impression.  That you have a good control on your diabetes. When in reality, you may not be see the A1C number is a percentage of the average blood glucose level. It is measured in milligrams per deciliter. And for someone without diabetes, the A1C should be 5.7 or below. When the A1C test is used to diagnose diabetes and A1C level of 6.5 or higher on two different test yields. A diagnosis.  It's of diabetes, a result between 5.7 and 6.4. Well, that would give the diagnosis of prediabetes. This means that you're too high risk of developing type two.

       " \"Hello, my name is Carlton rivers and I'm a registered dietitian with Nick pet. Today. We're going to be discussing how to improve your diet after a diagnosis of diabetes. Now. These strategies are not just for those with diabetes. I encourage everyone to apply these tips to their diet every day. So let's get started. The first thing that you want to remember is to monitor the amount of carbohydrates you eat that way, you're able to control your blood, glucose levels, or blood sugar levels. So what is a carbohydrate? Well car? Hydrates are found in bread and rice and pasta and other starchy things like potatoes and corn and legumes which are beans and peas. Carbohydrates are also found in Sweet foods and drinks like fruit and milk and yogurt as well as sugar-sweetened beverages fruit juice and some candy. And of course any sweet desserts. So, the type of diet I'm going to be emphasizing. Today is the Mediterranean style diet.  Right. Now, this diet has huge amounts of research that have shown wonderful benefits in improving cardiovascular health. And also, increasing insulin sensitivity, which is necessary for someone with type 2 diabetes. A mediterranean-style diet is rich in seasonal fruits, and vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats, like fish and nuts and avocados. And then it's going to be moderate amounts of cheese and dairy products.  Like milk and yogurt, it's going to be moderate amounts, of lean protein, and eggs, and then just minimal amounts of red meat and sweets. So, if you notice over here, there's still are carbohydrates in the Mediterranean style diet. In this is where carb counting comes into play. So I find that carb. Counting is the best way to monitor the amount of carbohydrates, you eat and drink at mealtime and for snacks. So, what I have done here is, I've portion  Doubt the carbohydrate containing foods into one carb serving. So, what does that mean? Well, 15 grams of carbohydrates, equals one carb serving. So let's take this piece of bread. For instance, this piece of bread contains about 15 grams of carbohydrates. So we'll say this is one carb serving. Now, if your recommended to consume to carb servings for breakfast, then you want to limit your carbohydrate intake to 30 grams that breakfast.  The American Diabetes Association recommends a good starting point, as 325 carb servings per meal. That would be a sandwich made out of two slices of bread. You could put meat and cheese in it along with a bunch of non-starchy vegetables and then a small side of fruit. And there you go. You have three carb servings. So what I'm going to do today is I'm going to show you how to make the most out of this diet.  So I'm going to take a little over one cup of spinach, and then I'm going to grab some tomatoes and a radish.  And what's great about these vegetables, is they're very low in carbohydrates. So we call them free foods. You can pretty much eat as much as you want of these foods and not raise your blood glucose levels. So I'm going to add this to the salad and I always love adding a salad to any meal because it just helps helps fill you up. So we're going to slice up some of this radish and add it to the salad. And then we're going to grab some water.  That's what's your filled with really healthy fats.  They're really great for your brain health and to raise your good cholesterol, your HDL cholesterol. So I'm just going to crush some of that. Now, one serving size is about one Palm full which is one ounce of nuts. And then I'm going to add in some just mozzarella cheese. Just slice it up, sprinkle it on and then we're going to do salad dressing. So it's really just one tablespoon of olive oil and a half a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar.  Or whatever vinegar that you prefer, so I'm going to drizzle it over.  And now, of course you can buy salad dressing in the grocery store, but it's probably more expensive. And if you get the low-fat version, then it's going to be high in sugar. So I say go with homemade, it's usually better anyways, so I'm also going to add in about 3 ounces of salmon fillet. And so, there you go. So this meal actually does not have many carbohydrates. It does not even have a full one carb serving. So if you want to add carbon  Hydrates to this meal, you could add half of a sweet potato, which is about 15 grams of carbohydrates. You could add one cup of strawberries, which is one carb serving.  And then you could add half a cup of grapes. So not all fruits are created equal. There are some that are higher in carbohydrates than others. For instance, berries are going to have the lowest amount of carbohydrates. Whereas grapes are a bit higher and so our bananas. So one carb serving of banana is going to be half of a banana and then for an apple one, small apple is going to be one carb serving. So if you have a big apple, you're probably going to want to cut it in half.  Monitor your carbohydrate intake. So, remember when you're trying to make a lifestyle, change involving your diet, it's not that difficult. Look at all the wonderful food that you get to eat. All you have to do is make sure you're eating nutrient rich foods so high in vitamins and minerals so yummy fruits and vegetables, whole grains, things that are going to fill you up and keep you satisfied. They're also going to improve your health and just make you feel better. So, when you're adjusting your diet to control,  Your blood glucose levels or your blood sugar levels, go low in carbohydrates, and high in those healthy fats like olive oil, avocados in Salmon. It's going to take a little bit more preparation, but I know you can do it. So eat up and enjoy. Happy eating.\",\n",

I want to emphasize that my perspective is coming from one with type 2 and not type 1 diabetes. Our channel is primarily for those with type 2 diabetes and prediabetes.  Today, I want to answer the question. Will I lose my feet because of prediabetes?  After you watch the video today, I invite you to check out the description box for my new ebook. This is one of the most comprehensive diabetes meal planning books. You'll find anywhere it contains. Diabetes friendly meals and recipes recipes for different goals. Such as eight hundred, two 1800 calories per day meal plans, diabetes meal, planning tips and tricks. There are also tons of diabetes friendly recipes for everyone.  Now, let me State up front that the chances of someone with pre-diabetes losing a foot to amputation because of the disease is highly unlikely. I've found no cases in my research, but why would someone asked this question in the first place? Well, diabetes can lead to complications in which amputation may be necessary. Let me explain with the help of the American College of foot and ankle surgeons people with  BT's are more susceptible to foot problems often because of to complications of the disease nerve damage. I'll called diabetic neuropathy or poor circulation. Peripheral neuropathy causes a loss of feeling in the feet, reducing the ability to feel pain or injury poor circulation. Diminishes, the body's ability to heal making it difficult to resist infection and heal injuries or  Means for a person with diabetes, these complications can be deadly combination. When a person with diabetes has neuropathy. They often can't tell if their shoes are causing pressure and producing corns, calluses Cuts or blisters. These minor foot injuries can develop into ulcers, which is a break or hole in the skin. With poor circulation. The ulcers can become infected and then may not heal properly. Now, this is a  Complication associated with diabetes and can lead to a chronic foot ulcer, which is the leading cause of amputation, amputation is considered when healing potential is poor or a serious infection becomes widespread and could threaten the patient's life. Now, let me reiterate, this is talking about diabetes, not pre-diabetes. However, we have discussed a pre diabetes can lead to type 2, so I think it's important.  That we talk about these now to prevent these complications. It's vital to take preventative measures to care for your feet, including wearing proper shoes, daily foot inspections and regular exams, by your healthcare provider or even a podiatrist. Even the smallest foot problem can turn into serious complications. It's important to seek treatment early for any issues. Especially minor Cuts, blisters corns and calluses.  Now, when complications arise, the loss of life and limb are real concerns for those with diabetes who have a serious infection, Physicians and patients must work together to consider the best options to treat that infection prevent limb loss and to get the patient as well as possible.  Now amputation is a complicated and it's something that both patients and Physicians work hard to avoid. If possible. It is estimated that nearly 85% of amputations are preventable, with education and early intervention amputation. Should not always be seen as a failure of treatment, but sometimes a faster more reliable means of Rehabilitation in order to return to activities of daily living.  The surgery may be the best way to control a severe infection that could require a more traumatic amputation in the future or that could. Otherwise prove fatal for the patient after undergoing, an amputation patients often experience improve General Health because the severe infection has been resolved. Now, amputations not always mean loss of an entire foot or leg surgical intervention is performed at many levels.  Reading partial toe, amputations partial foot amputations or below the knee, amputations a foot and ankle surgeon will make a thorough assessment and determine the best method of getting the patient on the road to recovery. Now, as stated earlier, the likelihood of one with pre-diabetes losing, a foot is extremely unlikely. However, those with type 2 are at a higher risk. So let's watch those feet. Let me give you a quick.  Session and foot care and this really should become a daily routine for you. Inspect your feet. Check your feet and Toes inspecting, the tops sides. Souls heels in the area between your toes. If you're physically unable to inspect your own feet, use a mirror or ask someone to help contact your doctor immediately. If you discover any sores, redness, Cuts, blisters or bruises.  Wash your feet every day in warm water, with mild soap, hot water and harsh soaps can damage your skin. Check the water temperature with your fingers or elbow before putting your feet. In your diabetes, may make it difficult to sense. Water temperature with your feet. Be sure to dry your feet. Pat them dry and make sure they're dried. Well infections tend to develop in moist areas. So make sure  You draw the area between your toes very well and moisturize your feet. If the skin on your feet feels rough or dry use lotions or Oils, but do not use them between your toes. This is a very important thing. We're talking about here, very important stuff. Make sure you take care of those feet.  Don't forget to get my new e-book and please subscribe to our channel for many more videos like this one in the future. Thank you so much for watching.

       " \"Welcome to my channel health for you.  What are the different types of diabetes? There are two major types of diabetes called type 1 and type 2 type 1. Diabetes was also formally called insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.  Or do win the line onset, diabetes mellitus in type 1 diabetes. The pancreas undergoes an autoimmune attack by the body itself and is rendered incapable of making insulin abnormal. Antibodies have been found in the majority of patients with type 1 diabetes.  Antibodies are proteins in the blood that are part of the body's immune system. The patient with type 1, diabetes must rely on insulin medication for survival.  What is type? 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, such as type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly manufactures, antibodies and inflammatory cells that are directed against and cause damage to patient's own body tissues in person with type 1 diabetes. The beta cells of the pancreas, which are responsible for insulin production are attacked by the misdirected immune system. It is believed that the tendency to do.  I love of normal antibodies in type 1. Diabetes is in part genetically inherited, though.

These antibodies can be directed in the majority of patients and may help that remind which individual are at risk for developing type 1, diabetes.  At present the American Diabetes Association does not recommend General screening off the population for type 1 diabetes, though, screening of high-risk individuals, such as those with a first-degree relative sibling or pairing with type 1, diabetes should be encouraged type 1, diabetes tends to occur in young lean individuals, usually before 30 years of age. However older patients to present with this form of diabetes on occasion.  This subgroup is referred to as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, ld8 lie.

This actually means the pink.  As produce larger than normal quantities of insulin. A major feature of type 2. Diabetes is a lack of sensitivity to insulin by the cells of the body, particularly fat and muscle cells. In addition, to the problem with an increase in insulin resistance, the release of insulin by the pancreas, may also be defected and sub optimal optimal. In fact, there is a, there is known.

Finally, the liver in these patients continues to produce glucose through a process called gluco neo genesis, despite a riveted glucose levels, the control of gluconeogenesis becomes compromised.  It is said that type 2 diabetes occurs mostly in individual over 30 years old and the incident, incidence increase with age and N are alarming number of patients with type 2.

       " \"Administration of glucagon.  Most students with diabetes will have an order for the use of glucagon, if needed. However, Wisconsin statute chapter, 118 Point, 29, allows glucagon to be given to any student who is known to have diabetes and is believed to be experiencing a severe low blood sugar, low blood sugar and children with diabetes can have varied symptoms. These can include, but are not limited to nervousness, shakiness weakness, extreme hunger.  Slight nausea. Dizziness headache blurred vision fast heartbeat and or feeling tired based on the child's individual. Health plan also known as a diabetes action plan or diabetes emergency plan, low blood sugar is treated with some type of quick, acting oral sugar, such as candy icing, and or juice.  Severe low blood sugar symptoms include disorientation unconsciousness, and seizures. If not treated promptly. It can lead to death. Glucagon is an injectable medication and is used in emergency situations when the student is unresponsive or unable to swallow because of a very low blood sugar.  Given that when a child is having symptoms of severe low blood sugar. It can be a stressful situation. It is highly recommended that you familiarize yourself with the students emergency plan beforehand.  Your school nurse or other licensed, Healthcare professional must review. The glucagon procedure with you to ensure that you have the skills to perform this emergency medication administration store the diabetes, emergency plan and glucagon kit in a location that is easily accessible During a severe low blood sugar event. Be sure that staff members who have regular contact with the student know where the medication is stored.  The glucagon kit contains a vial with powder and a syringe with liquid diluent.  Be sure to check the expiration date on the medication package. Remember to keep Health Care information, confidential.  Procedure for medication administration, identify that symptoms of a severe low blood sugar reaction are present. And that based on the child's diabetes, emergency plan, medication needs to be given.  Call for assistance. Ask that another school staff person call 911 or Emergency Medical Services.  Explain the procedure to the child at his, or her level of understanding.  Assemble supplies and place on a clean surface.  Review the students diabetes emergency action plan.  Check the glucagon kit and order to be sure it is for the right child.  The right medication.  The right dose.  Being given at the right time.  And being given by the right route. Also check to ensure the medication has not expired. Wash, your hands of possible.  Put on gloves.  Remove the glucagon vial and syringe containing the liquid or diluents from the case.  Remove the gray cap from the vial.  Remove the cap from the syringe.  Place the needle tip in the center, top of the vial and slowly push the deal. You went from the syringe into the vial.  Gently swirl the vial with a syringe still in the vial until the solution is clear. This takes about 10 to 15 seconds.  Turn the vial upside down, being sure that the needle does not fall out of the vial.  Pull the solution into the syringe, by pulling back on the plunger as you withdraw. The ordered amount of glucagon solution.  If present remove air bubbles by tapping on the outside of the syringe and expelling the air, or by pushing the dose back into the vial and pulling back on the plunger again.  Recheck, the five rights again, checking the glucagon kit and order to be sure it is for the right child, the right medication, the right dose being given at the right time and being given by the right route.  Identify the location buttock thigh or arm for the injection, cleanse, the injection site with an alcohol wipe.  Insert the needle into the skin at a 90 degree angle.  Slowly inject the solution.  Remove syringe.  Put the used syringe in the carrying case. Closed the carrying case to avoid a possible needle stick injury, apply pressure, using the alcohol wipe and gently massage injection site.  If the student is not lying on their side move, the student to a side-lying position because vomiting often follows the injection of glucagon. If needed ask another person for assistance.  If alone with student and you have not already called 911 or Emergency Medical Service do so now.  Monitor, the students arousal pulse and respirations if breathing stops begin rescue, breaths.  If breathing and heartbeat, stop, begin CPR.  Maintain a side-lying position to prevent aspiration due to vomiting. Once Rescue Squad arrives inform them of medication administered including type of medication dose and time send along glucagon kit along with used dose dispose of all used materials. And proper receptacles, remove gloves and wash hands.  Follow up with the parent or guardian and healthcare provider as needed.  Document the event and administration of glucagon including time day dosage, and site of administration.\",\n",

And if, you know, the signs to look for, then you can avoid having to deal with long hospital, visits and stays and all of that. And you can go straight to just learning to manage your blood sugar. So we are going to go through the warning signs with you guys and kind of talk through them. So that you know what? They are. Excessive thirst check. You definitely got that. Didn't you frequent urination? Yeah. What  Yeah, we were on a road trip at one point when we were like wow Aspen has to pee a lot bedwetting or heavy diaper. Nope.

I don't know what's going on, but I asked her to play dolls with me, which Aspen would have jumped at the chance to play dolls with Shay anytime. And she told me she didn't want to play because she just wanted to take a nap. She basically was just on the couch all day, every day. Pretty much. And we thought, maybe she had like mono or something is with the doctor when we talked to him on the phone thought she might have, because she just was so lethargic.  She would walk down the stairs, get on the couch and just kind of lay there all day, stomach, pain, nausea and vomiting. She did not have nausea and vomiting but definite stomach pain. In fact, we thought she had a major gluten issue. So, we had taken her off gluten completely, which is that actually helped. It seems weird, but it's because gluten has so many carbs. So I made me go higher. Uh-huh. Fruity breath odor. What? I don't know. I didn't I didn't ever notice that what I think it means your breath smells like  Fruit fruity. Breath odor. What? It's so weird. I'm nervous that one. Yeah, apparently people who are in dka have like really sweet breath smell rapid, heavy breathing. Like she would be sitting on the couch doing nothing and just having the like  Like you could tell it was like something was not right at all. It's often mistaken for so type one, diabetes. All the signs for dka are sometimes mistaken for a stomach flu or virus. Strep throat, grow it growth spurt urinary tract infection or in our case mono. So any kind of flu like thing, you know, a lot of people think oh, well, she must just have some sort of bug. So our heart is really to help other kids, not have to go through it.  We went through, I would love to be able to get more awareness around this, so that kids are diagnosed so early that they don't ever have to go through the dka and the sickness part because they really don't have to. We had actually, when we were being educated at Barbara Davis, there was a little girl in there who had never gotten sick at all. They went in thinking, she had a urinary tract infection, I think, and she was diagnosed type one diabetic. Here. We were with like poor emaciated Aspen, who is so skinny and it  I've been in the hospital for three days. She had needle, pokes, you know, all over her and she looked awful and then this little girl just look perfectly healthy and she hadn't been sick at all. But they had found it quick enough that she didn't have to go through all that if you or someone, you know is experiencing these symptoms right now. Please go to a doctor and ask them if it could be type 1 diabetes. They can easily test and find out. If it is with either a finger prick or a urine test. We would love to be able to prevent other kids.  From having to suffer through this. And so, that's our real heart here. And we are joining with Beyond type one, who's doing a big dka awareness project and they want other people to spread the word. So that more and more people can know about this. If people just know the signs and know what to look for, this can so easily be prevented. So beyond type, one wants to send all of you guys a packet that will help spread awareness for dka. This is full of all these little  Posters for you, and actually, they're in Spanish or English, which is pretty great. We would love for you guys to get a packet like this. Take these posters. Don't just let it sit in your house because that is pointless. Take these posters and hang them up at your school. Go and ask your school. If you can hang it in the nurse's office or hang it in the hallway or take it to your doctor's office. Take it to your church, wherever you can find that you can raise awareness for. This is a really fantastic thing.  NG that we would love to partner with you guys in. So, we'll put a link below to the page on Beyond type one.org that you need to go to to get your own packet so that you can get started. The other thing you can do to spread awareness is to share this video. So if you're on Facebook, share this video on Facebook, share this video on Twitter, on Instagram, or wherever you can put a link that way. Other people can know the signs and know what to look for. And you never know who's going to be watching.  Who's going to be like? That's what's going on with my kid right now. So please share this. So that more people can know what to look for. And also if you would like to follow along with our family's Journey, just click subscribe. We would love to. Have you join us. It's never a dull moment, really. And also, we'll put a link below to a playlist that has some more sort of specifically diabetic videos in that. And also there's a place here, you can click to subscribe. So, thanks so much for watching and now  Now, you know, we have to do.  We have to go change your insulin pump. Oh, yeah, so that's what comes next.

       " \"Hello, I'm Tom Mason of the diabetes, Council.com researcher writer and I have type 2 diabetes. Today. I want to talk about the glycemic index after you watch the video today. I do invite you to check out the description box for my new e-book. This is one of the most comprehensive diabetes meal planning book. You can find anywhere it contains, diabetes friendly, meals, recipes recipes for different goals, such as 800 or 1800 calories. Day meal plans, diabetes meal, planning tips and tricks. There are also tons and tons of diabetes friendly recipes for everyone. Let me State up front that why? I believe the vice emic index is a very important tool for those of us with diabetes. I truly believe. The glycemic load is a better tool but the glycemic load uses the glycemic index in its calculation. Therefore understanding the GI is also an important concept to get the absolute best research.  So for this project, I will be quoting a lot of material from the official website of the international GI database which is hosted by the University of Sydney that web address is www.osemtv.com. Now, this website is an extraordinary research tool with a plethora of information about the glycemic index and I truly invite you to visit this site if you want to know more about this topic, but as I stated all of my research was done on this extensive website,  Not the vice emic index is a ranking of carbs, on a scale from 0 to 100, according to the extent, to which they raise blood sugar levels after eating. The ranking is as follows foods with a GI of 55 or less is considered a low GI food food for the GI of 56. 269 is a medium GI food and foods with a GI of 70, or higher is a high GI food. Now food to the hi.  Hi GI are those which are rapidly digested and absorbed this results in a yo-yo effect. In the blood sugar levels, low GI foods are digested and absorbed in a gradual way. This produces a much more even rise in blood sugar and insulin levels. Now, research has proven this much more beneficial to the health of those with diabetes. Low GI diets have been shown to improve both glucose and lipid levels. In people with diabetes, both type 1 and type 2 weight can be  Much better with a low GI diet. Low GI foods are absorbed slowly, which helps keep you Fuller longer the impact on your blood sugar is minimal. And you will see a reduction in insulin levels and insulin resistance. Now, recent studies from the Harvard School of Public Health indicate that the risk of type 2, diabetes and coronary heart disease are strongly related to the GI of the overall diet, the World Health Organization and food agriculture organization.  Recommends that people in industrialized countries, based their diets on low GI Foods in order to prevent the most common diseases of affluence such as coronary, heart disease, diabetes and obesity. Now, I found it very interesting, how a GI value, for a particular food is determined according to the GI website, quote, to determine a Foods GI value, measured portions of the food, containing 50 grams of available carbohydrate or 25.  Of available carbohydrate for foods that contain lower amounts of carbs are fed to 10 healthy people. After an overnight fast, finger prick, blood samples are taken at 15 to 30 minute intervals over the next two hours. These blood samples are used to construct a blood sugar response curve for the two-hour period. The incremental area under the curve, is calculated to reflect the total rise in blood glucose levels. After eating the test food. The GI value is  Calculated by dividing the iau, see for the test food, by the I UA C, for the reference food, the same amount of glucose and then multiplying by 100. Now the chart on your screen may make that a little bit more clearer. There is now a push by some to have terms like sugars and complex carbs. Be removed from the nutritional label and replaced with total carbs. That's carbs - dietary fiber and glycemic index. The main problem with this concept is that there are  Very few places who conduct legitimate GI calculations the human nutrition unit at the University of Sydney has been at the Forefront of glycemic research for over two decades and is tested hundreds of foods as an integral part of its program. Now, if you watched any of my videos at all, you know that I'm an advocate of the glycemic load, rather than just the glycemic index. But if I seem again decks basically only tells us how quickly a food is digested and gets into the bloodstream. But the glycemic load,  Takes into consideration every component of the food as a whole, it tells us much more about how the food will affect our blood sugar overall with glycemic load. The numbers are a bit different foods to the GL of 10. And below are considered low g l foods with hgl between 11 and 19 are considered medium GL and foods with a 20 GL or boar is a high G L food. Now, because the glycemic load of a food looks at the food as a whole and not just the  The same food can have a high GI but an overall low GL, making it better for you than it. Originally might have been have appeared take watermelon. For example, if you looked at the GI of watermelon, you wouldn't need it at all. Why? Well depends on the type melon actually, but the GI of watermelon can be between seventy and ninety five. So you are told as one with diabetes. You can't eat that. It's G is way too high. There's too much sugar, but the glycemic load of watermelon is between  Six, it has very little impact on blood sugar. So you might not have considered watermelon on the basis of GI, but the GL is so low. It's a great summertime snack and I was very pleased to see the following on the GI website quote glycemic load or GL, combines both the quality and quantity of carbohydrate in one number. It's the best way to predict blood glucose values of different types and amounts of food. Now, that really  We made me feel well validates my hypothesis on the GL. Now the formula to calculate g l is very simple. You take the GI multiply the amount of total carbs, divided by 100. Now the amount of carbs, the total carbs is that - dietary fiber, you take the carbs - a dietary fiber. And this is also specific to an amount of food. So, let's do a calculation. For example, you're told is a person with diabetes. You shouldn't eat white bread. Well, let's look at this, the  I have Wonder, Bread is 70, that's a high GI food one. Slice of Wonder Bread has 15 carbs, one dietary fiber. So our formula would be 70, which is the GI x 14. That's 15 minus 1 divided by 100. This equals nine point eight. Wonder Bread, has very little impact on your blood sugar. A slice of Wonder Bread can be wonderful for you now. I hope this has shed light on the glycemic index and possibly  only a little more about the glycemic load as well.

       " \"Hello, I'm Tom Mason of the diabetes, Council.com researcher writer and I have type 2 diabetes. I want to emphasize that my perspective is coming from one with type 2 and not type 1 diabetes. Our channel is primarily for those with type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes today. I want to answer the question.  My father has diabetes. Should I be screened for pre-diabetes on a regular basis?  After you watch the video today, I invite you to check out the description box for my new ebook. This is one of the most comprehensive diabetes meal planning books. You'll find anywhere it contains. Diabetes friendly meals and recipes recipes for different goals. Such as eight hundred, two 1800 calories per day, meal plans, diabetes meal, planning and tips and tricks. And there are also tons of diabetes friendly recipes for everyone.  Diabetes is a complex condition. Several factors must come together for you to develop type 2 for example, obesity and a sedentary lifestyle play a role, but genetics can also influence, whether you'll get this disease. The really needs to be more research in the field of prediabetes, but there seems to be a link especially given the fact that many with pre-diabetes develop type 2 within 10 years. Now this  Article is based on genetic links with time to simply because the research isn't extensive enough for prediabetes, but I honestly feel the comparisons are closely related and can be extrapolated. Now, if you've been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, there's a good chance that you're not the first person with diabetes in your family. According to the American Diabetes, Association your risk of developing type 2. Diabetes is one in seven.  If one of your parents was diagnosed before the age of 51 in 13, if one of your parents was diagnosed after the age of 51 into, if both, your parents have diabetes, several gene mutations have been linked to the development of type to these gene. Mutations can interact with the environment and each other to further, increase your risk. Now, the role of genetics in type 2 diabetes. Well, it's there.  And it's also an environmental Factor. Scientists have linked several gene mutations to a higher risk of diabetes. Not everyone who cares, a mutation will get diabetes. But many people with diabetes do have one or more of these mutations and it can be very difficult to separate genetic risk from environmental risks. The latter is often influenced by your family members, for example, parents with healthy eating habits are likely to pass.  Come On To The Next Generation. On the other hand. Genetics play a big part in determining weight. Sometimes, behaviors. Can't take all the blame.  Studies of twins. Suggest that type 2 diabetes might be linked to genetics. These studies were Complicated by the environmental influences, that also affect type two risks to date numerous mutations have been shown to affect type 2. Diabetes risk, the contribution of each gene is generally small. However, each additional mutation, you have, seems to increase that risk in general mutations and any  Involved in controlling glucose levels can increase your risk of type 2 diabetes. These include genes that control the production of glucose the production and regulation of insulin. How glucose levels are sensed in the body genes associated with type 2, diabetes include tcf7l2, which affects insulin secretion and glucose production, a bcc8, which helps regulate insulin capn.  Zero which is associated with type 2. Diabetes risk in mexican-americans blood to which helps move glucose into the pancreas. The gcg are a glucagon hormone involved in glucose regulation. Now, tests are available for some of the gene mutations associated with type 2. The increased risk for any mutation is small. However, other factors are far more accurate predictors of whether you'll develop type 2, diabetes.  Including your BMI your family history, high blood pressure, high triglycerides and cholesterol levels, history of gestational diabetes, and being a certain ethnicity such as Hispanic African American or Asian American.  Now we do have some tips for prevention, the interaction between genetics and the environment. Make it difficult to identify a definite cause of type 2. That doesn't mean you can't reduce your risk through changing your habits, a large study of people at high risk, for diabetes, suggest that weight loss and increased physical activity can prevent or delay type 2. According to the diabetes, prevention program. Here are some things you can do to start today.  And we have many videos on this already but start an exercise program slowly add physical activity into your daily routine. For example, take the stairs instead of the elevator part further away from the building entrances. You can also try going for a walk. Drink lunch. Once you're ready. You can start adding light weight training and other cardiovascular activities your aim 30 minutes of exercise. Each day five days a week. You also need to eat.  The year, it can be hard to avoid extra carbohydrates and calories when you're dining out cooking. Your own meals, is easiest way to make healthier choices. You can ease yourself into it, to start by planning your lunches for the week. Once you're comfortable with that, you can plan out additional meals.  Choose healthy, snacks. Try things like carrot, sticks, instead of that candy bar apples or other fruits. Fruits are a wonderful source of fiber and most cases and are great healthy snacks. A handful of nuts air-popped popcorn. Don't add a lot of salt or butter and eating crackers and cheese. Now knowing your risk for type 2. Diabetes can help you make changes to prevent developing the condition. Tell your doctor about your family history. They can decide if  Testing is right for you. They can also help you reduce your risk through lifestyle changes. Your doctor may also want to regularly schedule your glucose levels.  Check those that can help them detect, any blood sugar, abnormality, or warning signs for type 2 earlier earlier treatment can be a positive impact on your outlook. Now just because your father had diabetes, should you be screened for diabetes on a regular basis or prediabetes? Well, that's really up to you. There seems to be a genetic link. So talk to your healthcare provider, see what they have to say about at least yearly blood.  Screenings and A1C test for you.

       " \"Insulin is the hormone normally made in the pancreas that stimulates the flow of sugar glucose from the blood into the cells of the body glucose provides the cells with the energy they need to function.  There are two main groups of insulins used in the treatment of diabetes human insulins and analog insulins made by recombinant DNA technology.  The concentration of most insulins available in the United States is 100 units per milliliter a milliliter is equal to a cubic centimeter. All insulin syringes are graduated to match this insulin concentration.  There are four categories of insulins depending on how quickly they start to work in the body after injection. Very rapid acting insulin or rapid-acting insulins intermediate acting insulins long-acting insulin.  In addition some insulins are marketed mixed together in different proportions to provide both rapid and long-acting affects certain insulins can also be mixed together in the same syringe immediately prior to injection.  A very rapid acting form of insulin called Liz bro. Insulin is marketed under the trade name of Humalog a second form of very rapid acting insulin is called as part and is marketed under the trade name novolog.  Humalog and novolog are clear liquids. They begin to work ten minutes after injection Peak at 1 hour after injection and last 3 to 4 hours in the body Humalog and novolog are used as bolus insulins to be given 15 minutes before a meal most patients also need a longer-acting insulin to maintain good control of their blood sugar Humalog and novolog.  Can be mixed with mph.  Check your blood sugar level before giving Humalog or novalog your doctor or diabetes educator will instruct you in determining your insulin dose based on your blood sugar reading and anticipated meals and exercise always check the bottle before drawing up the insulin. If the solution is cloudy discard the bottle if you are mixing Humalog or novalog with a longer-acting insulin always drop the Humalog.  NovoLog first to maintain the Purity and Clarity of the Humalog and novolog Solutions  Another solution of insulin that acts rapidly is called regular or our insulin. This insulin does not act as quickly as Humalog or novalog.  Regular insulin is a clear colorless liquid. It begins to work 30 minutes after injection Peaks at three to five hours and last 6 to 10 hours in the body regular insulin is usually given 30 minutes before a meal it can also be mixed in the same syringe with longer acting mph or given separately immediately after each other.  Large and cannot be mixed with it.  Regular insulin is the most stable of all the different types of insulin but unopened regular insulin is best refrigerated always check the bottle before drawing up the insulin. If the solution is cloudy discard the bottle if you are mixing regular with a longer-acting insulin always drop the regular insulin first to maintain the Purity and Clarity of the regular solution.  examples of intermediate acting insulins are NPH  intermediate acting insulins are cloudy suspensions of crystalline insulin. They need to be gently rotated between the hands before being used. They begin to work 1 hour after injection Peak at 6 to 12 hours after injection and last 20 to 24 hours in the body. The intermediate insulins are often given before breakfast. They may also be given at bedtime depending on your  Glucose reading they can be mixed in the same syringe with regular list bro and asked part insulins. Another long-acting insulin is called glargine insulin. It is an insulin analog manufactured by recombinant DNA technology.  Unlike other long-acting insulins glargine insulin is a clear solution of insulin it begins to work about one hour after injection.  There is no pronounced Peak small amounts of glargine insulin are released slowly to provide a relatively constant amount of insulin in the body over 24 hours glargine insulin cannot be mixed with any other insulin a change to glargine from NP age should be done under the close supervision of your medical team.  There are three stable pre mixed formulations of insulin one contains 70% of NPH insulin and 30% of regular insulin another formulation contains 50% of NPH and 30% of regular insulin the third contains 75% of the mph and 25% of Humalog.  These mixtures begin to work around 1/2 hour after injection peek into to eight hours and last up to 24 hours in the body as these pre-mixed insulins contain Rapid or very rapid acting insulin. They should be taken before meals as directed by your medical team.  With your doctor's instructions several combinations of two different types of insulin can be mixed together in the same syringe and given as one injection once mixed the combined injection must be given immediately or the effect of the regular component of the injection will be diminished.

But what matters in body time is what the sun is doing at the suprachiasmatic, nucleus, or scn for short. This is  located in your brain and correlate. The amount of light falling on the retinal ganglion cells with body function. This information is then passed to all the body parts stuck in the dark. So they too can sink their clocks. Pretty much everybody part has a clock, but for us.  To see these clocks is tricky, but it can be done. The team made one of the molecular components of the bodies clock system. The period, one protein glow in the dark using a little genetic engineering. This glow-in-the-dark clock allowed them to watch the pancreas clock tick and while it was while watching,  Watching this clock, the team discovered how well, the clock ticked depended on, how much like the owner of the clock was being exposed to at night in the pancreatic islets of animals that experience, 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark. The clock, ticked, and talked to a regular rhythm. This didn't happen in animals exposed to light at night.  The clock still ticked but not quite as loudly. You can see this year. The clock waves are different. It seems pancreatic clocks tick better when they're put in the dark. Unfortunately, being in the dark doesn't always happen when we climb into bed. We turn off the lights but the lights in the neighborhood don't have an office.  Each being exposed to light at night is commonplace. Does it matter when the team explored further they discovered that insulin release in response to glucose was impaired in the Cox that had lost their Rhythm. This mirrors the problems in type 2 diabetes.  This research suggests beta cells in rats. At least, need time in the dark odds are so do human beta cells. Are you sleeping in the dark? Remember your night valet? Melatonin is a wimp. He's afraid of like even tiny amounts that  Not be enough to interfere with your sleeping can suppress his activity because instead of being out and about, he's stuck in the pineal gland and this adversely impacts, your body's clocks, and if the pancreatic clock loses, it stick it impacts how.

Well, they're eating less, they're forced to biochemically speaking. Their insulin levels have dropped dramatically. So do they lactate and alanine levels? These are the chemicals the liver uses to make sugar. So what is the story with insulin and lactate?  Well, this Story begins with muscle cells taking up the glucose.  As the glucose slips into the cells, a phosphate group is thrown on it creating glucose-6-phosphate with the phosphate attached with glucose is effectively trapped inside the muscle. This means it has to be used and using involves the glucose molecule being quite literally.  Pulled apart in a process known as black calluses. Now, what happens with the bits Left Behind, depends on how hungry the cell is in a hungry. Cell pyruvate is shipped to the mitochondria, as the electrons shoot around the TCA cycle. They generate massive amounts of ATP, which is used to power up the  Sell all that is left of the molecule is a little water and carbon dioxide, but when cells are not so hungry. The bits hanging around. Now, this might sound like a good thing. The cell has a ready to use fuel supply, should this situation change, but there is a catch  Too many pyruvates start to impact the redox status of the cell. The cell is stuck at Defcon 1. It's alive, but barely kicking. They just aren't enough electrons around for chemistry to happen, to maintain a good vibe, the cell must downgrade portions of the fuel stockpile from pyruvate to lactate.  Now generally speaking. It ends up with one pyruvate for every 10 lactate molecules. It's a juggling game and the cat lactate is a wonderer. It likes to leave the cell. It does this with the help of a transporter. It can pop out of the cell and dive back into the bloodstream.  Being a whirl around the body. Sometimes it's scrapped by hungry cells and burned as fuel but a lot of it whines up in the liver. Now, the livers mission is to feed the brain and the body, the arrival of lactate signals, the liver to whip up a batch of glucose.  Quick as a flash lactate becomes pyruvate. Which then whizzes through the gluconeogenesis pathway and Wala. A glucose molecule is made and released into the circulation to feed the hungry.  Cells that are out and about doing the thing are typically hungry, but in the middle of the night, no one is hungry muscles. Definitely. Aren't they taking it? Easy? The other big yukos casler. The brain is also enjoying a siesta. So it's glucose needs are lower to. So the glucose  Around accumulating in the circulation doing damage and you wake up with an unbelievably high glucose reading, even though you haven't eaten for hours, making your muscles a little hungry.  Should help lower fasting glucose levels. One way to do. This is to exercise, especially exercise later in the day.  Of course, metabolic imbalances. Make this easier said than done.

That's a lot and to manage it all you'll need a sense of emotional balance in your everyday life adjustment problems are very individual. They can show up in as many ways as there are people with pre-diabetes. However, there are several adjustment problems that show up often in people with diabetes.  These they include denial that they have the disease anxiety about it anger depression feeling guilty feeling overwhelmed and even eating disorders having proud problem of her fur Furfrou.  And having problems relating to family members or other people close to you. Now people with diabetes tend to have these types of problems more often than most other people scientists think that the reasons are partly physical and partly emotional on the physical side having pre-diabetes or diabetes may make your brain and nervous system more prone to having problems on the emotional side having diabetes and prediabetes.  Well knowing you have a long-term chronic disease can put you under a lot of emotional stress and self-management itself can be a stress since it can be a difficult boring and quite often frustrating.  Now this form does not allow me to go into every single problem that you must cope with but one thing that is in common with all the factors. I just listed is stress. Your main coping problem will arise from dealing with all this stuff and all this stuff is causing you stress dealing with stress is an important skill for people with pre-diabetes and diabetes the combination of high stress and pressure.  Diabetes can lead to serious physical problems and learning to deal with them. Well, well that can help you stay healthy. So first of all, I think we need to Define what stress is we think we might know but stress is a reaction to a change or problem many people feel stress as being anxious or tense or even threatened stress can come from a physical change or strain like having an  Injury or illness it can also come from emotions such as being upset or angry or even worried stress is a part of everyone's life stresses can be very small and they can be very large every day. Most people have some small stresses like spilling some water or misplacing your keys at some time. We will all have large stresses like the death of a loved one or the loss of a job even  Good changes, like buying a house or having a baby can cause stress. Now. How does your body react to stress? Well, when you feel stressed your body releases hormones that speed up your heart a tense your muscles and raise your blood pressure and your blood glucose. This is called the fight or flight response in old times this flight or fight response help people to act quickly against a physical threat  For example, if a person encountered a wild animal the stress response helped him to fight it or to run away. Now in modern times most stresses in life are not physical instead emotional stresses are more common. For example feeling misunderstood at work worrying about money or having an argument with a family member. Sometimes the fight or flight response can help you stay focused and alert.  So you can deal with stresses that last a short time like taking an exam or giving a speech but it won't help you deal with most long-term stress has the stress response can cause high blood glucose and high blood pressure in people with diabetes and pre-diabetes. If these high levels last for a long time, they can cause severe damage to your body high stress can also make it hard for you to do things that keep your body healthy.  Z when feeling stressed some people tend to overeat and do not eat at the right times or eat the right things others might stop exercising. They may turn to alcohol or drugs. All of these things can damage your health. So how do you cope with stress? Well, you can never get rid of all the stress in your life, but you can learn to cope with stress in positive ways.

Okay? All right.  Not now.\",\n",
       " \"D and our units are going to be mg per deciliter. And actually, let me just do it this way. Let me just say that. Everything is in milligrams per deciliter a liter and we'll talk in the future videos about well, what kind of how we can relate these units to Everyday terms, but let's say that, this right here, is 50, this right here is 100, this right here is 150, and let's  a kit right here at 200. So let's think about what would happen for a normal person? Let me Mark some hours over here. So our 12345678. That's probably good enough. So the normal person, when they haven't eaten anything for a long time, let's say greater than eight hours. So their fasting blood sugar will be right around 80 milligrams per deciliter give or take.  A little bit. There's a range around that but I just want to show you what would happen to a normal person. So an 80 80 milligrams per deciliter. Their blood sugar will kind of be should hopefully be right around there and sometimes this fasting blood sugar and maybe we're assuming that this is in the morning. So maybe this our one is seven in the morning so they haven't eaten for a while and that's why it's fasting blood sugar. This is all so you'll hear and kind of you'll sometimes hear doctor's wife heard. My wife say, this word, without knowing what it meant. They'll sometimes say, pre-printed.  And eel free prandial, which is a very fancy word, which just means before a meal, prandial is literally, before eating after the meal, you're talking postprandial. So it's a very fancy word for a very simple idea eating. So let's say it our to this individual eats breakfast. So this is right. This is where the individual is going to eat breakfast. Now in a normal person when that person eats breakfast will be  Carbohydrates, some carbohydrates in that breakfast and it will be broken down into glucose and glucose will enter the bloodstream and so their blood glucose will go up. Their blood glucose will go up. It will slowly go up and I was reading some studies. They say it kind of It kind of spikes at about 45 minutes into a meal. So let's see. 45 minutes is over there. So maybe it'll go up to about there and in a normal individual the blood glucose really shouldn't go up above.  120 milligrams per deciliter and all who, you know, there's obviously exceptions to all of these were just kind of saying a normal breakfast, a normal person. They're not, you know, they're not eating a pint of honey. You're not doing something crazy. So let's say 120 would be right around right around there. A normal person. You wouldn't someone who does not have diabetes. It would be unlikely that it would go above that. And then actually, after about two hours. They're getting pretty close to normal to get back under. 100 milligrams per deciliter.  And then you go beyond two hours. They just kind of get close back to their Baseline to that 80 milligrams per deciliter. So once again, this is this is normal and of course, you know, don't freak out if you were to take a blood test one morning and you're at like 80 5 milligrams per deciliter. You're still not far off from normal. So obviously there's some variation from person to person. Now if someone has diabetes, if either they don't have time,  Type one there. They don't have enough insulin to actually process the glucose or if they have enough insulin, but their body is a desensitized to it. The insulin isn't being processed properly. So they can't process the, the glucose we've seen that the glucose concentrations will go up. And so in general, if you were to wake up one morning after not having eaten for more than eight hours and you were to pick your prick, your finger, with one of those little glucose monitors, you can get at the drugstore and in your  Your finger, the blood sugar levels. If you were to find them to be, let's say you were to find them to be at 100. Let's say 140 140, that's 140 milligrams per deciliter. It's a good indication. I mean, you shouldn't freak out. You should do multiple tests and make sure that that, you know, it wasn't a false reading or any of that. And you should definitely see a doctor once again, don't view this as any type of medical advice. That is not the purpose of this. The purpose of this is just to  And a little bit of what's going on. Don't don't ya. Don't change your lifestyle based on anything. I tell you. All right. So if you but if you do experience that, it looks like at least just from that one data point that your body isn't processing sugar properly because you've had over eight hours to process the sugar for insulin to go in your bloodstream and and a lot of glucose to be taken up and get back down to a normal level, but it still hasn't gone there. So if you were to, if you were to test a value like that you should you should be concerned about  General, the threshold. And I've seen multiple thresholds here are between 100 and I've seen High kind of mid 120 to 130 milligrams per deciliter. So that's kind of, let me do it in this range. It's kind of. If you are above, if your fasting blood sugar is above this line right here. Remember the fasting blood sugar, not after you've eaten a meal, your pre prandial before a meal. If it is above that threshold right over there. Then you should, at least you should definitely see a doctor and make sure that they can, they can  and, you know, see if you, if you have diabetes, but this would be cause for concern. The other thing is, if after a meal, it spikes. Well, beyond that, if we're talking, if it gets above 180 and, you know, once again, these are all just thresholds that people, you know, doctors have come up with and researchers have come up with it. Say hey, this is a good indication that somehow you are not processing glucose properly. So 180 180 is up here and I'm drawing it as a squiggly line because it's kind of a range. It's not like, you know, it's not like a hundred you if your blood glucose is.  24, you're safe and all of a sudden at 125, you have diabetes, you know, they're, you know, they're not that different than each other, but they have to set up some threshold so that just to kind of have a threshold, I guess. So if your blood sugar, after eating a meal were to spike up to let's say, 200 once again, that would be cause for concern. So in general if someone has diabetes because they're not processing, the glucose properly after their blood glucose might look something like this, so maybe  Be there fasting, blood glucose is right around 125 130. It can move around, then they have a meal then it might Spike up and they might have obviously they can process some of the glucose. Otherwise they would they would die, but it's not being processed properly. So the glucose levels, don't go down to where they should and maybe you get some, some glucose gets taken up from the blood. Obviously, they're living so their cells are metabolizing something, but it never gets down to  Do the normal eighty milligrams per deciliter? It might go. It might settle down back to Something in the 120 range or something like that, which would be, cause for concern. And in general. If you're someplace in jail. I've seen the threshold. If you're above 100 and it kind of fasting basis. That's cause for concern you should, maybe adjust your lifestyle. And if you're above if you if you're above 120 130 after a meal, once again, this you should also be slightly worried that  you might maybe are pre-diabetic or you have some risk of that developing it diabetes. So this is what this is a high. If someone has blood sugar like this, they're probably diabetic and if someone has blood sugar like this, they should be, they should be worried. But once again, I am not a doctor don't take any of this as an advice. This is really just our attempt to to understand things a little bit better.\",\n",

Well, when it comes to snacks or any food for that matter, I like to look at the glycemic load. There are those who will tell you the glycemic index is what matters and the glycemic index really doesn't give you a complete understanding of what a particular.  A food will do to your blood sugar. It simply gives you a number based on 50 carbs of a specific food. The glycemic load takes into account. What type of card we are dealing with and how it truly affects your blood sugar postprandial. Now, I say this to say that if you see a food on my list of best snacks and on another experts list, bad snacks, or were snacks. Well, then maybe you'll know why I'm going to give you both the GI and the  Elevate food on the list. I also do not put any list in any type of order. So, here we go. Popcorn, man. I Love Popcorn. This of food. You will probably see on some were snacks list because a GI is a medium 55, but the glycemic load of popcorn is a very low 2.8. It is unprocessed form. Popcorn is considered a significant source of whole grain fiber. I  Love Popcorn for breakfast. Yes. You heard me right? Popcorn with a little bit of sucralose and 2%. Milk is a wonderful cereal. You ever hear of some of those corn Shields. I mean really, what are they? You may think I'm crazy but try it. It truly is a great snack for any time. Not just watching a movie Greek yogurt. Now, Greek yogurt is rich in calcium, high in proteins and probiotics.  There are few Foods healthier than Greek yogurt. They do have some carbs, but they aren't significant Greek. Only has about 4 grams of sugar per 6. Ounce serving, Greek yogurt, contains a significant amount of potassium, calcium and magnesium, which is shown to improve blood pressure, calcium, phosphorus and magnesium are important in bone health and the GI of Greek yogurt, is only 11 2. Gee L is 0.  Put some strawberries walnuts in a cup of Greek yogurt. You're going to thank me. Later.  Walnuts, I am convinced walnuts or the overall best food for you. I know they're expensive and that's why when I can find them on sale or buy them in bulk. I will jump at the chance stored properly. They can last a while, walnuts have a GI and g. L of 0 means that they have no significant effect on raising your blood sugar. They are extremely heart healthy. They also contain copper manganese, vitamin D vitamin B6.  The super rich in omega-3 fatty acids and you really need those in your diet strawberries and blueberries or really any kind of berry, but especially those two, there are a great alternative to those. With both a sweet tooth is strawberries that are sweet low in calories. They make a great snack, several human Studies have established that people who eat plenty of berries have a lower risk of both diabetes, heart attacks and  Man, shh Studies have also linked the high vitamin C content of strawberries to a lower risk of type 2. 1 cup of fresh strawberries provides. A hundred sixty percent of your daily need of vitamin C. Listen, you want to really good snack? Okay. Blend fresh or frozen strawberries and or blueberries into a smoothie, those strawberries and blueberries have a low GI in the low 40s as an average and the GL.  About four.  Peanut butter. Now. I know you're shaking your head. Peanut butter on this list. Has anyone ever told you that someone with diabetes shouldn't eat peanut butter. Well, you can tell them. They're nuts. Peanut butter has a glycemic index of 14 and a glycemic load of six. This low ranking means, peanut butter helps stabilize blood, sugar and insulin levels. Yes, they have a lot of calories and you will see several carbs on the label, but a tablespoon full of peanut butter is an amazing snack.  To fill you up to very low in cholesterol. It's a good source of niacin and manganese apples. Yeah. I know. It's another fruit, but a small apple about the size of a tennis ball delivers, 77 calories, 21 grams of carbs and 4 grams of fiber. That sounds like a lot, doesn't it? Well, it's a good source of vitamin. C has a smattering of other vitamins and minerals the main benefit of an apple though, is the richness, they possess inside.  All Yubel fiber. This fiber keeps you full and slows down the absorption of those carbs and sugar into your tree helping regulate blood glucose levels the GI of an apple 39, the GL only for a dark chocolate bar now hear me out. I know you're thinking I've lost my mind. But remember I said dark chocolate. Not milk chocolate. There is a huge difference. Listen, Italian.  Searchers discovered that health benefits of dark chocolate include significantly. Improved markers of insulin sensitivity, decreasing fasting insulin and glucose levels as well as insulin and glucose responses to the glucose tolerance test. There's a small catch, you are looking for high quality dark, chocolate bars that contain at least, 70% cocoa.  The higher, the better but a 70% cocoa bar. The entire bar like doves, dark chocolate, a GI of 23, a GL of 4.  Boiled eggs. Now I am one is think that eggs are an amazing superfood. Boiled eggs are an amazing. Super snack boil up a half dozen or so, put them in the fridge. They're awesome with just a little bit of sea salt, as a snack eggs, are a good source of riboflavin vitamin B12 and phosphorus, and a very good source of protein and selenium, a big factor, the GI, and GL of eggs are both 0.  String cheese cheddar provolone mozzarella. They're the best type. They have a GI and g l of 0 that should be enough of an incentive to eat them. They're prepackaged for portion control there. Very filling. Plus they contain a great source of calcium. Vitamin D and protein. Now, I may get laughed off YouTube for this one, but number 10.  Peanut M&M's now, I'm not talking about a huge amount here, a fun size bag, which is a good snack size. Only 90 calories the bulk. This candy is a peanut very little chocolate. It has a gif 33, and a GL of six. It's a great snack plus. Sometimes we like to cheat a little bit. Well, this really isn't cheating, but it seems like it. This snack will come.  Give us permission to cheat a little. Give us a good feeling psychologically. And yet not harm, our blood sugar levels. Well, there's my list. I hope you enjoy it.

       " \"Everything we've discussed so far involved, recognizing and tagging or engulfing Shady things that were found outside of cells. So outside of cells, we've seen things like a b-cell, a b cell has its membrane bat, membrane bound antibodies. This membrane bound antibodies may be one of these, my You might recognize something Shady out in the outside of the cell. And, of course, this part over here, as we know these, they all have a variable portion right over here. So this is specific to this Shady thing. Then this will be engulfed and then parts of it. Parts of it will be attached to an MHC 2 complex. So let me do that in a different color. So an MHC 2 complex, and  Then that will go to the surface that will go to the membrane of the cell to present itself. So that's an m, h 2 MHC, 2, complex. And so it has a little bit of the little little piece of of the Shady thing out here. We call this a little shady Peach. This is, this is this is an antigen. This is an antigen presenting cell here and then we've seen as especially if this is a b-cell then a helper T, cell that is also has a  Double portion that corresponds to that corresponds to this specific antigen.  So this would be a helper T cell right over here. So, this is a helper T helper cell. When it recognizes that, it'll start dividing into memory helper, T cells, and effector helper, T cells, and the effector helper T cells especially Ring, the Alarm bells, and start kind of accelerating the B cell replication. I guess you could say that the B Cell Activation and, and the theory is that this is kind of a double handshake process. But once again, this is what's occurring outside.  Out of cells. So when we found stuff outside of sales, we can gulp them and then we presented them on MHC 2. Complexes MHC 2 complexes. So now you're probably thinking, well, that's the outside of cells but you know, there's a meaty to there's these helper T cells, but we've also referred to cytotoxic T-cells. What do those do? And we've also if there's mac to there's probably an MHC one complex. What does the MHC one complex do?  And if we're, you know, we can recognize Shady things that are happening outside of cells, but don't Shady things sometimes happen inside cells. And what do we, how does our immune system respond to that? And actually, as you can imagine, all of those, all of those things are, will be entered in the rest of this video. So let's think about what's happening. Let's think about what happens when Shady things start to happen inside a cell. So, for example, for example, it might not even be due to a virus or due to a, a back to some type of bacteria could be.  The cell itself has gone awry. So let's say that this right over here is a cancer cell. So it's had some mutations. It's starting to multiply like crazy. So this is a cancer cell and the cancer cell because it had mutations going to produce. It's going to produce some weird, some weird proteins. So these cancer cells are going to produce some weird proteins. So every, every every cell with a nucleus in your body, and that's pretty much.  Much every cell except for a red blood cells has the has MHC. One complex has. And the point, the whole point of the MHC, one complex is to is to bind to Shady things that are produced inside of the cell Shady things that are produced inside of the cell and then present them to the membrane. So even in a malfunctioning cancer cell should be doing this, so then it will. So this MHC, one complex.  Bound to this bound to this the strange proteins that are produced by the the mutations inside of the nucleus and then it can present them and then it can present them. And so what you could imagine what the appropriate, immune spot response should be these things, these cancer cells. These cancerous chesed cells should be killed and actually let me label this properly. So that was m8c to you're presenting an antigen that was found those initially.  We found outside of the cells engulf and then taken out MHC 1 MHC 1. It's binding to Shady things inside the cell and then presenting it out. Now. This thing should be killed. Now as you can imagine, what's going to kill it. Well, that's where the cytotoxic T Cell comes into the picture. So the cytotoxic T cell is going to have, so that's a receptor right there. It'll have a variable portion. That's specific to this type of analysis.  Jigeon, and so it'll bind there and then once it does that it says oh boy. There's this all this Shady stuff here. These Shady proteins that are in produce this this cell and all the other ones, like it need to be killed. And so the cytotoxic T Cell will begin to replicate once again, like other other types of immune cells is going to replicate into the into the memory cells just in case, this type of thing, shows up 10 years in the future and also the effector cells. So this is memory.  And also effector and also, and also effector cells, effector cytotoxic T cells. And as we always know, the effector version is the thing that actually does something. It starts to actually affect things and what it is going to affect. It is going to start binding to things that are that are presenting the same antigen on top of as part of their Mr. On top of their MHC one complex. So this character right over here, so it's presenting.  Same antigen. It's presenting that same antigen on this MHC. One complex. And remember the variable portions need to match up. So let's say that this is this is an effector cytotoxic T cell  An effector, cytotoxic T cell and actually let me draw a little bit, a little bit different. So let me draw it. Like this. This is effector cytotoxic to toxic cease T-cell. Its receptor. Its variable portion is the one that's compatible with this antigen that's being presented, right over here. So, let me just label this again. This is the mhc1 complex. This is an effector cytotoxic cytotoxic T Cell. So who put the C? Therefore side?  Toxic. And what it does is it since you kind of latches on to the cell that needs to die, and it does, it not only does have this receptor interfacing with the MHC, one complex, but actually has a whole series of protein and I'm proteins and I'm not drawing this to scale, really, this would be much smaller relative to the scale of the cell that essentially latches on between the two. And I'm not going to go into detail but essentially forms what you could call an immuno synapse, which is the kind of where the two things are interacting with each other. And so when it identifies this and says, okay, I need a  kill this thing or I essentially, I need to make this thing kill itself. It starts releasing all of these molecules so it can release molecules like perforins. So it'll release these perforins, which will essentially cause gaps or holes to file, to, to form in the, in the, in the membrane of the cell that needs to die and then it can release other things, like granzymes that can go in and essentially cause this thing to kill itself. So the whole point of this video,  Is to appreciate, I guess what we haven't talked about yet. We had already talked about what happens when you identify Shady things outside of the cells and then how you can kind of bring them in and then present them and then use that to further activate the immune response. Now, we're talking about identifying Shady things inside the cells. Those get presented by MHC, one complex has and then the cytotoxic T cells recognize them and then Force the cell to kill themselves and this wouldn't just be cancer cells. This could also apply to a cell that has  Already been infected by a virus. So for example a cell like this already. So that's its nucleus. It's already been infected by some virus. It's already been infected by some virus. So it's hide. The virus has hijacked the cells replication Machinery in order to replicate itself. And so the proper immune response is hey, look I'm a I'm a I'm a virus making machine. I knew I should kill myself. So so it'll take some it'll read some of the antigens that are being produced.  It's inside of by virtue of by the viruses. They're going to bind to MHC. One complex has two MHC. One complex is so pieces of the virus, are going to bind to MHC one complex has, and then they're going to be presented on the surface. They're going to be presented do this way presented on on the surface. So this exact process can happen again.\",\n",
       " \"When it comes to insulin production, wow, the pancreas is the focus of everyone's attention, particularly when beta cells fail. Now, to be fair, the failure is relative. The little guys are still pumping out insulin. It's just not enough. Meet the extra ordinary demand. The unrealistic demand is sparked by widespread insulin resistance, which is a polite way of saying the movers and shakers in the body. Ignore insulins advances and daunted the pancreas.  It's churning out more and more insulin. This strategy works for a while until the beat is cells. Can't take the pressure turning out. Insulin. 24/7 is exhausted.  So why do cells become insulin resistant at this stage? No one knows for sure. Why insulin becomes the Pariah? It might have something to do with insolence. Pushy personality. Oh, Tia too much insulin is definitely rather off-putting.  But insulin should only be making deliveries at dinner time. The trigger for beta cells to pump out, insulin is primarily glucose. And as long as your beta cells are strong and healthy glucose levels, only rise when you eat something. But  In anyone who is metabolically challenged insulin levels are high morning noon and night night. Hmm. Where does the insulin come from? Most of us? Don't actually eat. When we're sleeping on paper, at least be two cells.  Should get some relief from being the insulin pumping machine. So why is it that people with metabolic issues? Wake up with insulin levels in the stratosphere. Could the insulin be coming from somewhere else? Join us for this episode of Better Body. Chemistry TV as we investigate.  We're all that extra insulin might be coming from Better Body. Chemistry TV is brought to you by dr. Sandy a scientist, turned Gremlin Buster. Helping you battle. Sugar, Gremlins. Heffalumps & other health, Horrible's through Better Body chemistry. Remember small things can make a big difference.  To your health. Now, any text book will tell you, beta cells are the only cells that produce insulin, but there are not recently a group of researchers based in the Netherlands rewrote. The textbook beat his cells are not the only source of insulin in the body. They are by far.  Away, the biggest source, but there are not the only cells with this power. The Dutch team found fat cells are insulin producers using fancy molecular biology techniques. They screened several different kinds of fat cells looking to see if the insulin Gene was being expressed and whether  Insulin was being produced. It was, this is an immunofluorescent. Confocal, laser-scanning image of human, visceral fat cell. Now, the enormous green blobs are the lipid droplets in which fat is stored. The Redbirds peeking through our where an antibody which recognize insulin has bound demonstrating. That insulin is  Being produced by fat cells that when the team probed exactly, which fat cells could and couldn't produce insulin. Both subcutaneous fat cells that is fat cells, located on the outer layers of your body and visceral fat cells. That is fat cells located deep inside your body, could turn out insulin, but baby fat cells, otherwise known as  Be adipocytes will not insulin producers no matter where they were located. Interestingly enough. The fat cells made less insulin. Not more when they were exposed to glucose. Now, the actual amount of insulin being produced is Tiny.  But if you have a lot of fat cells, each producing a tiny amount of insulin, it adds up enough to count. Well, maybe when the researchers plotted insulin levels against BMI in 41 human subjects ranging in weight from skinny to morbidly obese.  They found a straight line suggesting insulin production by fat cells. Impacts overall insulin levels. Ouch. Well, that sounds are bad. It's probably not a big surprise fat cells have a bad reputation. But up until now the problem with fat cells.  This has been more about insulin resistance, not insulin production. It will take some time to figure out just what fat cells are AB do when they churn out insulin. But in the meantime, This research reiterates, the importance of working on reducing your fat Mass it.

       " \"Technically, I'll just meet. Yeah, you could say that. What Makes Us human is our emotions or thoughts or memories, but physically, we're not all that different from this. We're used to thinking, of meat is the muscle tissue that people cook and eat, but the fact is, you can eat that stuff. Raw a chicken breast or steak or a pork chop is tender enough that it doesn't need cooking. What does need cooking is all the connective tissue that's in and around the muscle and gets in the way of our meal. So one of the main reasons humans began to roast and boil and bake meet in the first place was to break down those.  Active tissues that we can't do so we can get the meat now. You might have noticed that connective tissues kind of seem like a grab bag of materials that don't really fit in other groups are muscle nervous and epithelial tissue types are more uniform. More obviously grouped together sometimes our connective tissues, just seemed like the leftovers. You throw in the stew pot but appearances are deceiving and our inability. As a species. To tolerate these tissues in our food, is just one reminder that no matter how different tendon bone, or a hunk of fat may appear, they are indeed very  Closely related, they all spring from the same embryonic cells and their structures are dominated, not by cells, but by an extracellular Matrix, full of fibers, if those fibers that have given human is the most trouble and our meeting history. It wasn't until we figured out how to cook the stuff that we were able to denature or change the natural structure of those protein fibers so that they became soft and pliable. Take a chicken. For example, you couldn't just pull the skin off a living bird. Like ethically, you couldn't do that. But also you probably could. It's living skin is anchored by  Connective tissue that's full of collagen fibers. But if you roast that chicken and break apart that college, and suddenly the skin just peels right off with no effort at all. So, connective tissues as evidenced by this mess. Here are good reminders of how sometimes things are more similar than they appear. They're also delicious if you're into that.  So we know what our connective tissues have in common and we know that we've got four different types. But what do they look like? What do they do? And where are they found both in your butcher shop and on your body, perhaps, your most diverse type is your classic connective tissue proper. It comes in both loose and dense subclasses, based on how many fibers it has in its ground substance. On the back of your hand that fleshy tent. There. That's one example of loose connective tissue. There's a lot of ground substance in here and the last, and fibers help it snap back into place while the college.  It helps anchor it so you can't like snag your skin on a zipper and watch it. Just fly off the try. Pulling on your Achilles tendons. Are these winged tendons here and there isn't a lot of give that's because the tendon is an example of dense. Connective tissue with a lot more collagen, you could chew and chew and chew on a collagen dense, tendon and never get anywhere. That's why butchers trim off most dense connective tissue before selling cuts of meat. So loose, connective tissues, have fewer fibers and more cells. And more ground substance areolar tissue is the most commonly  loose connective tissue. You have found all over your body just under your epithelial tissue and wrapped around your organs. It's got a loose random arrangement to fibers with just a few fibroblast cells that make those fibers. If you look at it under a microscope, you'll see that it's most obvious feature is that it looks like it has a lot of open space in it. This makes areolar tissue great at holding a watery. Salty ground substance that surrounding tissues. Draw from your adipose tissue. Meanwhile is your fat tissue the loose connective tissue, that's in here, rather than being mostly ground substance. This one is,  Cells adipocytes which store lipids for later. Use insulate, the body against heat loss and grow pot bellies. And love handles. The average person's weight is about 18% out of us tissue. And it's those fat stories that Keep Us Alive when food is scarce with no fat stores. You die within a few days of your last sandwich reticular tissue is like areolar tissue, but with a woven massive reticular fibers rather than collagen and elastin fibers. And the name, this tissue provides the soft internal framework or stroma of the spleen. Lymph nodes and bone marrow, and it supports lots of  Developing blood cells. Just as your areolar tissue is a kind of sponge for watery ground substance. Your reticular tissue is what holds your blood in place in many of your organs. Really all of these loose connective tissue, proper types, share an Airy dispersal of fibers, which is why they're easier to eat after cooking and why you can pull cooked chicken skin. Apart, on the other hand. You can't easily rip a tendon or a ligament into or even chew it because it's made of that dense regular tissue full of tight, bundles of collagen fibers. All running parallel. You can see how neat and  Move, the slide sample looks under a scope, the fibers being, those white flexible structures. They provide great resistance to attention when that tension is exerted in One Direction. That's why you find this tissue and your tendons, which connect muscle to Bone or other muscle and your ligaments, which bind bones together anywhere. You got a joint one of those. Collagen fibers aren't all stacked regularly in rows. Then it forms dense irregular tissue whose fibers are thicker and arranged erratically, it's found wherever tension might be exerted in lots of different.  Directions, like the leathery dermis, underlying your skin. And finally, your body has places that require more elasticity than rigidity, like, say around your joints. That's where you'll find dense. Elastic tissue, for example, connecting your vertebra. So that your spine can curve and twist. Some of our largest artery. Walls are made of this stretchy elastic tissue to which provides both support and flexibility from fad to tendons. Connective tissue. Proper is the most diverse group in this tissue family, but for the last few minutes, you've also been watching a different type of connective tissue.  You bob up and down as I talk cartilage. Cartilage doesn't have any blood her nerves, and it stands up against both tension and compression pretty well. It's that whitish gristle. You see, at the end of pork, ribs or chicken wings in your Grocers freezer. And another thing that you're not going to have much luck toing, hyaline cartilage is the most common type, its kind of glassy looking and provides pliable. Support it connects to your ribs to your sternum and keeps the tip of your nose. All perky, its ground substance is Rich with those sticky starchy proteoglycans and all.  Although it has collagen fibers. When you look at it under a scope. You can't really see them. Instead the tissue looks glassy. Hence the name Heil meaning glassy or transparent. Elastic cartilage is very similar to hyaline. But with more elastic fibers that are easier to see and it's found in places where strength and stretch ability are needed like, it's why I can pull on my ear without it ripping off and just as your body needs firm parts and stretchy Parts. It also needs shock absorbers. That's where your fibrocartilage comes in. It's dominated by thick. Fibers of collagen and is good.  Standing lots of pressure. So it makes up the discs between your vertebrae and your knee joints where it keeps your bones from grinding together. And speaking of Bones. Although you might not think of something so hard and durable. As living tissue bones. Definitely are weird. Bone can refer to an entire organ, like your femur or scapula or just bone tissue and that bone or osseous tissue was just calcified connective tissue. Perfect for supporting and protecting your body's various structures. Spongy, bone tissue is typically found in the heads of long bones and in the  Inner layer of flat bones. Like the sternum, this spongy tissue is strong, but porous even to the naked eye and it uses this extra room to make and store bone marrow. Compact bone tissue, on the other hand, is quite dense with no visible spaces. It forms the external layer of your bones and stores. Calcium for bone cells. To use to make more tissue of bone doesn't conjure up. Your traditional image of the tissue. Blood probably doesn't either. I mean, it doesn't seem to connect things or lend support and yet blood is our fourth type of connective tissue. When you think about it.  Clearly does connect distant parts of your body and provide some rigidity to other parts, just like other connective tissues, blood develops from mesenchyme and is made up of cells surrounded by an extracellular non-living Matrix. In this case. The ground substance is your blood plasma, which has protein fibers floating around in it. Your Bloods mean, job, of course is delivering Goods. It transports cells and nutrients and hormones and wastes and all kinds of other stuff. Keeping all the parts of your body connected in the process. Most of your blood cells are erythrocytes or your famous.  Red blood cells that Zoom around carrying oxygen and carbon dioxide through your body. You've also got larger infection-fighting white blood cells or leukocytes in the mix and your platelets, the small cell fragments needed for blood clotting. So that a paper cut doesn't bleed you dry. Unlike other connective tissues. It doesn't really have what you would call fibers, but instead has a bunch of protein, dissolved in the plasma, and those protein molecules will form fiber-like structures when your blood needs to clot. So, you take your four primary types of tissues.  And all of the subtypes of each that's taken us weeks to explore. And you can probably see how they can come together in many, many combinations to form. All of your body's organs and just like that chaotic cafeteria pack with middle schoolers would be a hopeless messes without our hierarchy, of organization, our inner and outer boundaries and the ability of our systems to communicate with each other. That is what our tissues do for us, and we wouldn't exist without them today. We wrapped up our four episode series on tissues with a survey of the subgroups of loose and  Connective tissue, including areolar, adipose reticular tendons, ligaments, dense, irregular and dense elastic tissue. We also talked about the three cartilage types of spongy and compact bone, connective tissue, and how and why? Our blood is also a connective tissue type.

       " \"One of the most serious chronic complications of diabetes mellitus is a condition known as diabetic nephropathy, which if you break down the term into Neff row and pathy literally means kidney disease that occurs secondary to diabetes and it's actually pretty common as it eventually affects about 20 to 40 percent of all individuals with diabetes including both type 1 and type 2 in this tutorial. Let's talk about the mechanism underlying the cause of diabetic nephropathy.  Why and how individuals with diabetes develop the condition so diabetic nephropathy is a chronic complication of diabetes mellitus meaning it usually has a slow progression over decades after the initial diagnosis of diabetes and to give you an overview of what happens an insulin deficiency due to the diabetes results in hyperglycemia, which then causes hypertension and kidney dysfunction. This kidney function is actually them further worsened by the hypertension and ultimately all of this.  It's in kidney failure, which can have very severe and potentially even life-threatening complications such as anemia, electrolyte imbalances such as metabolic acidosis and heart arrhythmias. Now before we dive into the mechanism of diabetic nephropathy, let's briefly review the structure of the glomerulus in the kidney by bringing in a diagram here. So the glomerulus is the portion of the kidney where blood is initially filtered. So blood enters the glomerulus over here through this,  This efferent arteriole and then leaves the glomerulus through the efferent arteriole and you can remember this that it leaves through the efferent arteriole for E4 exit or efferent. And while the blood is within the glomerulus. There's this Advanced filtration system, which we'll talk about more in a minute and the filtered fluid that exits the blood is known as the filtrate and it collects in Bowman's space before it enters into the tubules of the Nephron where further reabsorption and secretion.  Kurz before it exits the kidney into the ureters as urine. Now one last structure to point out in this diagram is this vessel coming off the efferent who you'll hear now this vasculature actually wraps around the tubules of the Nephron and contributes to the reabsorption and secretion of solutes now to add to this diagram. Let's imagine we took a cross section of this climb areolas and looked at it on its end and it would look a little bit something like this now we can use this diagram here to better.  Picked some of the important structures within the glomerulus. So here you can see the capillary vessels and each of them. I've drawn in here a little red blood cell to help remind you that it's a blood cell and as you can see these vessels are surrounded by a few additional structures that we couldn't really appreciate in that first diagram. So these are the structures that contribute to the three layered filtration system of the glomerulus the first layer is that of the vascular endothelium. So the endothelial cover the inside of the blood vessel so that  Capillary wall there and then the second layer is the glomerular basement membrane or GBM for short which is a specialized basement membrane that surrounds the vascular endothelium.  And then the last filtration layer is the visceral epithelium, which is also known as the podocytes now in between all of these capillaries here is the museum which is comprised of cells known conveniently as mesangial cells and they produce a collagen Network that structurally supports all of these capillaries and it's across this space that filtration occurs within the glomerulus of the kidney. So how exactly does diabetes a problem with in.  And divisions that result in kidney damage. Well, the answer includes multiple compounding factors. Now, the first component is an increased pressure state within the nephron and this is due to two mechanisms. And the first is hypertension, which is a common comorbidity associated with diabetes mellitus. So hypertension or high blood pressure results in an increased pressure throughout the entire arterial vascular system, and this includes the afferent arteriole of the glomerulus.  And so to think about how this increases the pressure within the glomerulus, let's think about a simple garden hose. So in the middle of the garden hose, there's a whole and as water flows through the hose a small amount of water will leak out through this hole. But if we open up this bigot all the way this is going to increase the pressure of the water traveling through the hose and intuitively this change is going to result in more water leaking from the hole here in the center and that's because there's  Increased pressure forcing it out of the hole. Now. This is similar to what occurs in the glomerulus the hypertension increases the pressure just like turning on that spigot which in return increases the filtration rate of the glomerulus, which can be thought of that leakiness from the hole in the garden hose. Now the other mechanism contributing to this high-pressure state is something known as vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole, which is just a fancy way of saying that this blood vessel constructs or get smaller in diameter.  So to understand why this occurs we need to briefly review the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system or Ras for short. So renin is a hormone that's secreted by the kidneys in response to decrease renal perfusion or low blood flow to the kidney. And this is a sign of low fluid volume throughout the body. So in response to a low fluid volume renin has a Cascade of effects in order to maintain blood pressure as well as volume status.  And one of these effects is constriction of the efferent arteriole which then maintains this pressure within the glomerulus in the presence of a decreased renal perfusion. So once again, let's go back to this garden hose to understand this a little bit better now instead of turning turning up the spigot as we did before. What do you think would happen if you were to Kink the hose on the other side of the hole once again intuitively. This is going to increase the pressure behind the Kink and subsequently.  Increase the rate at which water leaks out of the hole. So once again, this is similar to what occurs in the glomerulus in response to activation of this renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. There's a constriction of the efferent arteriole to build up pressure within the glomerulus to maintain the necessary filtration. And therefore it will increase the filtration rate even further, but why exactly is this happening if I just said that individuals with diabetes often have increased renal perfusion due to the hypertension then  why is a low pressure system such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activated and it's a good question and the answer is not exactly intuitive for some reason the underlying physiology of diabetes specifically the hyperglycemia results in a direct intra renal or within the kidney activation of this renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and subsequently efferent vasoconstriction independent of the volume status of the individual and therefore increases the globe.  Either filtration rate. So how does this increase pressure relate to diabetic nephropathy. Well as a pressure within the glomerulus increases this results in a process known as mesangial expansion The increased pressure results in trauma and damage to them as an geum of the glomerulus and in responses to damage the mesangial cells respond by secreting cytokines that produce inflammation as well as oxygen free radicals that result in endothelial dysfunction.  And all of this kind of combines into hypertrophy and Matrix accumulation within the Byzantium, which is known as mesangial expansion. And as you can see over here on the right as the museum expands the spaces or what are known as the fenestrations between the podocytes foot processes expand. Now this has two effects first, it decreases the surface area available within the glomerulus for filtration and second the dilation of the fenestrations.  Causes the filtration system to be leaky and larger molecules such as proteins are filtered out of the blood in the kidney. Then the last Factor contributing to diabetic nephropathy is a combination of the previously mentioned factors and this is ischemia. As I mentioned earlier the blood vessels supplying the tubules of the Nephron come off of the efferent arteriole and vasoconstriction of this arterial from the intra-regional activation of the Rena.  Angiotensin aldosterone system decreases this blood flow and in addition the cytokines and free radicals produced from the barrel trauma to the museum further damage the nephron vasculature and over time these processes result in ischemia or cell death and atrophy of the vasculature that supports the glomerulus as well as the two bills. So this will decrease the kidneys ability to filter blood and is ultimately what will lead to  Kidney, failure and diabetic nephropathy. So as you can see there are many different mechanisms that are going to contribute to the progression of kidney failure in individuals with diabetes mellitus. However, it's important to note that they are all directly associated with the underlying hyperglycemia. And therefore the progression towards kidney failure can be slow or potentially even prevented if the underlying diabetes is well controlled.\"]"

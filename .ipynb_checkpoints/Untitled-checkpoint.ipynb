      "['in this lecture we are going to cover\\ndrugs used for diabetes so let&#39;s getright into it\\ndiabetes mellitus is a chronic disordercharacterized by high levels of blood\\nglucose that result from eitherinadequate insulin production or\\nresistance of the body&#39;s cells to theaction of insulin now the two most\\ncommonly encountered types of diabetesare type 1 in which insulin producing\\ncells are destroyed thus eliminatinginsulin production and the second is\\ntype 2 in which there is insulinresistance and gradual insulin\\ndeficiency but first things first whatis insulin and how does it work well it\\nall starts with the food that we eatwhich for the most part gets broken down\\nby our digestive system into glucosefollowing a meal when the blood glucose\\nlevels rise beta cells of the pancreasislets start secreting insulin insulin\\nis a peptide hormone that binds to theinsulin receptor and stimulates glucose\\nuptake by our cells now under theinfluence of insulin liver and skeletal\\nmuscle store absorbed glucose in form ofglycogen many other cells quickly break\\ndown absorbed glucose to make ATP amolecule which provides immediately\\navailable energy so in summary you canthink of insulin as a key for entrance\\nof glucose into cells which either useit immediately for energy or store it in\\norder to meet future demand so now whathappens when blood glucose levels fall\\ntoo low well if that&#39;s the case alphacells of the pancreatic islets release a\\ndifferent peptide hormone that isglucagon glucagon simply has the\\nopposite effect of insulin so forexample when it acts on the liver\\nit causes breakdown of stored glycogeninto glucose which is then released into\\nthe bloodstreamso now let&#39;s switch gears and let&#39;s talk\\nabout drugs used for diabetes the firstgroup of agents I would like to discuss\\nis insulin and it&#39;s analogs so humaninsulin can be reproduced by recombinant\\nDNA technology using bacteria or yeastthe amino acid sequence of human insulin\\ncan also be altered to produce insulinanalogs with different onset and\\nduration of action now because insulinis a polypeptide it is susceptible to\\ndegradation in the gastrointestinaltract therefore in order to be effective\\nit&#39;s typically administered bysubcutaneous injection insulin\\npreparations are generally divided intothree major categories based on how\\nquickly and how long they work so firstwe have rapid and short acting insulins\\npreparations that fall into thiscategory are insulin Lispro insulin\\nAspart and insulin Glulisine which areconsidered as rapid-acting producing\\npeak effect in as quickly as 30 minutesand duration of action of up to 5 hours\\nanother analog that belongs to thisgroup is regular insulin which is\\nconsidered as short-acting with peakeffect as quick as 2 hours and\\nduration of action usually less than 8hours now you may wonder what gives\\nthese analogs the ability to act quicklywell here&#39;s the thing insulin molecules\\nnaturally like to stick together formingso-called hexamers that is six insulin\\nmolecules bound together these hexamersare too large to cross from the\\nsubcutaneous tissue into the bloodstreamtherefore they must first separate into\\nsingle insulin molecules beforeabsorption can occur so now what the\\nclever scientists did is they alteredamino acid sequence of insulin molecules\\nto make them less likely to aggregatewhich resulted in analogs with faster\\nabsorption and more rapid action next weintermediate acting insulin preparation\\nthat falls into this category is NPHinsulin also known as Isophane insulin\\nunlike the rapid acting insulins NPHinsulin has a little slower onset of\\naction it produces peak effectsomewhere around 6 hour mark and lasts\\nabout 18 hours these longerlasting effects are accomplished simply\\nby addition of zinc and protamine toregular insulin which results in a\\ncomplex that is less soluble the finaloutcome is delayed absorption and thus\\nlonger duration of action finally wehave long-acting insulins with slow\\nonset of action preparations that fallinto this category are the following\\ninsulin Detemir with a peak effectbetween 6 and 8 hours and duration\\nof action of up to 24 hoursnext insulin Glargine which doesn&#39;t\\nproduce peak effect due to its steadydelivery of insulin for about 24 hours\\nand finally we have insulin Degludecwhich also doesn&#39;t produce peak effect\\nand lasts beyond 24 hours and again allthese long-lasting effects are the\\nresult of modifications to the insulinmolecule in case of insulin Detemir\\nfatty acid side chain was added to theinsulin molecule which allows it to bind\\nto albumin and thus slow down itsrelease into the bloodstream insulin\\nGlargine on the other hand was modifiedto have low solubility at neutral pH\\nwhich causes it to form precipitate inthe subcutaneous tissue that slowly\\nreleases insulin into the bloodstreamlastly insulin Degludec was\\ndesigned to form long chains of hexamersin subcutaneous tissue that \\nserve as a depot from which insulin iscontinuously and slowly released now\\nwhen it comes to side effects notsurprisingly hypoglycemia or low blood\\nglucose is the most common oneassociated with the use of insulin\\nanother adverse effect is lipodystrophywhich can develop at the site of\\nrepeated insulin injections now let&#39;smove away from the insulins and let&#39;s\\ntalk about different type of injectableanalog used in treatment of diabetes\\nthat is synthetic amylin so first ofall what is amylin\\nwell pancreatic beta cells not onlysecrete insulin but also another peptide\\nhormone called amylinamylin&#39;s job is to delay gastric\\nemptying to suppress postprandialglucagon secretion and to promote satiety\\nthe only amylin mimetic that&#39;s currentlyavailable on the market is Pramlintide one of the biggest benefits ofPramlintide is that it allows insulin\\ndoses to be reduced however the risk ofhypoglycemia is still there other common\\nside effects associated with Pramlintideare nausea and modest weight loss\\nnow let&#39;s move on to the last group ofinjectable analogs that is incretin\\nmimetics so first off what are incretins wellincretins are a group of metabolic\\nhormones that are secreted from the gutin response to food ingestion and their\\njob is to stimulate pancreas to producemore insulin the two primary incretin\\nhormones are glucagon-like peptide-1GLP-1 for short and glucose-dependent\\ninsulinotropic polypeptide GIP forshort so in theory increasing\\nconcentrations of these hormones wouldbenefit patients with diabetes however\\nas it turns out their actions areactually quite limited\\nas a result of rapid inactivation by theenzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 DPP-4 for\\nshort to solve this problem scientistswere able to develop GLP-1 mimetics\\nthat are resistant to degradation byDPP-4 enzyme example of agents that\\nbelong to this class are Exenatide andLiraglutide in addition to stimulating\\ninsulin secretion GLP-1 mimetics slowgastric emptying and promote satiety as\\na result patients using these agentsoften experience weight loss some common\\nside effects also include GI problemssuch as nausea vomiting diarrhea and\\nconstipationlastly there have been some reports\\nsuggesting increased risk of pancreatitisassociated with the use of GLP-1\\nmimetics this is thought to be due totheir proliferative effects on pancreasnow let&#39;s switch gears and let&#39;s talk\\nabout oral antidiabetic agents so firstI would like to discuss a class of drugs\\nclosely related to GLP-1 mimeticsnamely DPP-4 inhibitors so another way\\nto enhance the effects of incretinhormones is to simply inhibit DPP-4\\nenzyme which is responsible for theinactivation of GLP-1 and GIP by\\npromoting the activity of GLP-1 and GIPhormones we increase insulin secretion\\ndecrease gastric emptying and reduceglucagon release drugs that belong to\\nthis class include AlogliptinLinagliptin Saxagliptin and Sitagliptin side effects of DPP-4 inhibitorsare similar to those of GLP-1 mimetics\\nwith the most commonly reported beingnasopharyngitis and headache now let&#39;s\\nmove on to another class of oralantidiabetic agents that is sulfonylureas so in order to understand howsulfonylureas work first we need to\\nreview the mechanism of glucosedependent insulin secretion from\\npancreatic beta cells so availableglucose enters beta cell through glucose\\ntransporter 2 abbreviated as GLUT2once inside the cell glucose gets\\nmetabolized to create a bunch of ATPnext the rising levels of ATP lead to\\ninhibition of ATP-sensitive potassiumchannels thus blocking the inflow of\\npotassium this in turn leads todepolarization of the cell&#39;s membrane\\nwhich triggers activation ofvoltage-gated calcium channels and then\\ninflux of calcium finally increasedlevels of calcium mediate fusion of\\ninsulin containing vesicles with themembrane leading to insulin release so\\nnow what sulfonylureas do is they bind toand inhibit the activity of ATP-sensitive potassium channels this justlike incoming glucose triggers membrane\\ndepolarization calcium influx andultimately insulin secretion other\\nactions of sulfonylureas includeincreased sensitivity of beta cells to\\nglucose and reduced hepatic glucoseproduction example of drugs that belong\\nto this class are Glimepiride Glyburide andGlipizide some of the common side\\neffects reported with sulfonylureas arehypoglycemia and weight gain lastly\\nbecause sulfonylureas are highlyprotein bound and most are extensively\\nmetabolized in the liver by cytochromep450 enzymes they tend to interact with\\nwide variety of other drugs now let&#39;smove on to another class of oral\\nantidiabetic agents that is glinidesso just like sulfonylureas\\nthe glinides also stimulate insulinsecretion from pancreatic beta cells\\nhowever they accomplish that by bindingto ATP-sensitive potassium channels at a\\ndifferent site and with differentkinetics than sulfonylureas as a result\\nthey have a more rapid onset and shorterduration of action this makes glinides\\na good choice for patients withprimarily postprandial hyperglycemia\\nexample of drugs that belong to thisclass are Nateglinide and Repaglinide common side effects includehypoglycemia and weight gain however the\\nrisk appears to be lower in comparisonto sulfonylureas now let&#39;s move on to\\nanother class of oral antidiabeticagents that is biguanides\\nso unfortunately the exact cellularmechanism of action of biguanides is not\\nentirely understood that being said themain blood glucose lowering activity\\nappears to be primarily throughreduction of hepatic glucose production\\nadditionally biguanides appear to slowintestinal absorption of glucose and\\nincrease insulin sensitivity whichenhances peripheral glucose uptake the\\nonly biguanide that&#39;s currentlyavailable on the market is Metformin\\nmost common side effects of Metforminare limited to GI tract and include\\nnausea vomiting diarrhea and loss ofappetite which may lead to weight loss\\nlastly because Metformin decreaseshepatic uptake of lactate it may\\nincrease risk of lactic acidosisparticularly in patients with organ\\ndysfunction such as congestive heartfailure or renal impairment now let&#39;s\\nmove on to another class of oralantidiabetic agents that is thiazolidinedionesthiazolidinediones work primarily by\\nselectively activating nuclear receptorcalled peroxisome proliferator-activated\\nreceptor gamma PPAR-gamma for short whenactivated this receptor binds to DNA\\ntriggering expression and repression ofspecific genes encoding proteins that\\nregulate glucose and lipid metabolism aswell as insulin signal transduction this\\nleads to effects such as increasedinsulin sensitivity in adipose tissue\\nskeletal muscle and liver as well asinhibition of hepatic glucose production\\nadditionally thiazolidinedionespromote fatty acids uptake and\\nutilization in adipocytes this decreasein fatty acid concentrations in turn\\nleads to increased uptake andutilization of glucose example of drugs\\nthat belong to this class arePioglitazone and Rosiglitazone now when\\nit comes to side effects in addition tolowering blood glucose levels\\nthiazolidinediones increase HDL levelsthis increase is especially pronounced\\nwith the use of Pioglitazone in partbecause of its effects not only on PPAR-gamma but also on PPAR-alpha as you mayrecall from my video discussing drugs\\nfor hyperlipidemiaPPAR-alpha is the main target of\\nfibrateswhich promote the formation of HDL\\nprecursors on the other hand thiazolidinedionesmay also increase LDL levels\\nhowever this increase appears to belimited only to larger less atherogenic LDL particles as for the otherside effects the use of\\nthiazolidinediones has been associatedwith weight gain and fluid retention\\nleading to peripheral edema few cases ofhepatotoxicity have also been reported\\nnow let&#39;s move on to yet another classof oral antidiabetic agents that is\\nsodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitorsso these agents\\nsimply inhibit glucose transporterlocated in the proximal convoluted\\ntubules of the kidneys that isresponsible for about 90% of glucose\\nreabsorption inhibition ofsodium-glucose cotransporter-2 leads to\\nincreased urinary glucose excretion andthus reduced levels of blood glucose\\nfurthermore this increase in glucose andsodium in urine generate mild\\nosmotic diuresis which may contribute tosmall reduction in blood pressure and\\nweight loss drugs that belong to thisclass include Canagliflozin and Dapagliflozin when it comes to sideeffects the most common ones are thirst\\nincreased urination and increased risk ofurinary tract and genital infections now\\nlet&#39;s move on to the final class of oralantidiabetic agents that is\\nalpha-glucosidase inhibitors so firstwhat is alpha-glucosidase well\\nalpha-glucosidase is an enzyme locatedin the intestinal brush border that is\\nresponsible for breaking downcarbohydrates into simple sugars such as\\nglucose so when alpha-glucosidaseinhibitor blocks this enzyme the\\nabsorption of glucose is delayedresulting in lower postprandial glucose\\nlevels drugs that belong to this classinclude Acarbose\\nand Miglitol now one of the biggestdisadvantages of these agents is their\\nsignificant gastrointestinal sideeffects which include abdominal cramps\\nbloating flatulence and diarrhea andwith that I wanted to thank you for\\nwatching I hope you enjoyed this videoand as always stay tuned for more']       25\n",
      "['Let&#39;s think a\\nlittle bit about howwe can tell whether our body\\nis processing glucose properly,and whether maybe\\nwe have diabetes.And I want you all\\nto take all of thiswith a huge grain of salt,\\nbecause I am not a doctor.This is not medical advice.My goal here is to kind of just\\nexplore the subject with you,and to try for all\\nof us to get a betterunderstanding of things.So let&#39;s think about what might\\nhappen after we have a meal.So let me draw a\\nlittle chart over here.So let&#39;s call this hours.And then on the\\nvertical axis, I&#39;mgoing to talk about our\\nconcentration of sugarin the blood.So blood sugar concentration.You could call it\\nglucose concentration.Blood sugar concentration.When we&#39;re talking\\nabout blood sugar,we&#39;re talking about glucose.And let me draw a couple\\nof points on this chart.So maybe this is 50.And our units are going to\\nbe milligrams per deciliter.Actually, let me\\njust do it this way.Let me just say that everything\\nis in milligrams per deciliter.And we&#39;ll talk in\\nfuture videos about howwe can relate these\\nunits to everyday terms.But let&#39;s say that\\nthis right here is 50.This right here is 100.This right here is 150.And let&#39;s mark it\\nright here at 200.So let&#39;s think about what would\\nhappen for a normal person.Let me mark some\\nhours over here.So hour 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.That&#39;s probably good enough.So in a normal person, when\\nthey haven&#39;t eaten anythingfor a long time, let&#39;s\\nsay greater than 8 hours--so their fasting\\nblood sugar willbe right around 80\\nmilligrams per deciliter,give or take a little bit.There&#39;s a range around\\nthat, but I justwant to show you what would\\nhappen to a normal person.So at 80 milligrams\\nper deciliter,their blood sugar\\nwill kind of be--should, hopefully, be\\nright around there.And sometimes this\\nfasting blood sugar--and maybe we&#39;re assuming\\nthat this is in the morning.So maybe this hour one\\nis 7:00 in the morning.So they haven&#39;t\\neaten for a while,and that&#39;s why it&#39;s\\nfasting blood sugar.This is also-- you&#39;ll\\nsometimes hear doctors,I&#39;ve heard my wife say\\nthis word without knowingwhat it meant-- they&#39;ll\\nsometimes say preprandial,which is a very fancy word\\nwhich just means before a meal,prandial is literally\\nbefore eating.After the meal, you&#39;re\\ntalking postprandial.So it&#39;s a very fancy word for\\na very simple idea, eating.So let&#39;s say at hour two, this\\nindividual eats breakfast.So this is where the individual\\nis going to eat breakfast.Now in a normal person, when\\nthat person eats breakfast,there&#39;ll be some carbohydrates\\nin that breakfast,and it will be broken\\ndown into glucose,and that glucose will\\nenter the bloodstream.And so their blood\\nglucose will go up.It&#39;ll slowly go up.And I was reading some studies.They say it kind of spikes at\\nabout 45 minutes into a meal.So let&#39;s see.45 minutes is over there.So maybe it&#39;ll go\\nup to about there.And in a normal individual,\\nthe blood glucose reallyshouldn&#39;t go up above 120\\nmilligrams per deciliter.And there&#39;s obviously\\nexceptions to all of these.We&#39;re just kind of saying,\\na normal breakfast,a normal person.They&#39;re not eating\\na pint of honey.They&#39;re not doing\\nsomething crazy.So let&#39;s say 120 would\\nbe right around there.A normal person, someone\\nwho does not have diabetes,it would be unlikely that\\nit would go above that.And then actually,\\nafter about two hours,they&#39;re getting pretty\\nclose to normal.They get back under 100\\nmilligrams per deciliter.And then you go\\nbeyond two hours,they just kind of get close,\\nback to their baseline,to that 80 milligrams\\nper deciliter.So once again, this is normal.And of course, don&#39;t\\nfreak out if youwere to take a blood\\ntest one morning,and you were at like 85\\nmilligrams per deciliter.You&#39;re still not\\nfar off from normal.So obviously, there&#39;s\\nsome variationfrom person to person.Now, if someone has diabetes,\\nif either they have type 1,they don&#39;t have enough\\ninsulin to actually processthe glucose, or if they\\nhave enough insulin,but their body is\\ndesensitized to it.The insulin isn&#39;t being\\nprocessed properlyso they can&#39;t\\nprocess the glucose,we&#39;ve seen that the glucose\\nconcentrations will go up.And so, in general, if you\\nwere to wake up one morningafter not having eaten\\nfor more than eight hours,and you were to prick\\nyour finger with oneof those little glucose monitors\\nyou can get at the drug store,and in your finger,\\nthe blood sugar levels,if you were to find\\nthem to be-- Let&#39;s sayyou were to find them to be\\nat 140, that&#39;s 140 milligramsper deciliter.It&#39;s a good indication.I mean, you shouldn&#39;t freak out.You should do multiple\\ntests and make surethat it wasn&#39;t a false\\nreading or any of that.And you should\\ndefinitely see a doctor.Once again, don&#39;t view this\\nas any type of medical advice.That is not the purpose of this.The purpose of this\\nis just to understanda little bit of what&#39;s going on.Don&#39;t change your lifestyle\\nbased on anything I tell you.All right.But if you do experience\\nthat, it lookslike, at least just from\\nthat one data point,that your body isn&#39;t\\nprocessing sugar properly.Because you&#39;ve had over eight\\nhours to process the sugar,for insulin to go into\\nyour bloodstream and allowglucose to be taken up and get\\nback down to a normal level.But it still hasn&#39;t gone there.So if you were to test\\na value like that,you should be concerned.In general, the threshold, and\\nI&#39;ve seen multiple thresholdshere, are between 100\\nand-- I&#39;ve seen high,kind of mid-120s to 130\\nmilligrams per deciliter.So that&#39;s kind of-- let\\nme do it in this range.If your fasting blood\\nsugar is above this lineright here-- remember,\\nthe fasting blood sugar.Not after you&#39;ve eaten a meal.Your preprandial,\\nbefore a meal--if it is above that\\nthreshold right over there,then you should at least-- you\\nshould definitely see a doctorand make sure that they can\\nsee if you have diabetes.But this would be\\ncause for concern.Another thing is\\nif after a meal,it spikes well\\nbeyond that, we&#39;retalking if it gets beyond 180.And once again, these\\nare all just thresholdsthat doctors have come up with\\nand researchers have come upwith that say, hey, this\\nis a good indicationthat somehow you are not\\nprocessing glucose properly.So 180 is up here.And I&#39;m drawing it\\nas a squiggly linebecause it&#39;s kind of a range.It&#39;s not like if your blood\\nglucose is 124, you&#39;re safe.And all of a sudden at\\n125, you have diabetes.No.They&#39;re not that\\ndifferent than each other.But they have to set\\nup some threshold justto kind of have a\\nthreshold, I guess.So if your blood sugar,\\nafter eating a meal,were to spike up\\nto, let&#39;s say 200,once again, that would\\nbe cause for concern.So in general, if\\nsomeone has diabetes,because they&#39;re not processing\\nthe glucose properly,their blood glucose might\\nlook something like this.So maybe their\\nfasting blood glucoseis right around 125, 130.It can move around.Then they have a meal.Then it might spike up.Obviously, they can process\\nsome of the glucose.Otherwise, they would die.But it&#39;s not being\\nprocessed properly.So the glucose levels don&#39;t\\ngo down to where they should.And maybe some glucose gets\\ntaken up from the blood.Obviously they&#39;re\\nliving, so their cellsare metabolizing something.But it never gets down to\\nthe normal 80 milligramsper deciliter.It might settle down, back\\nto something in the 120 rangeor something like that, which\\nwould be cause for concern.And in general, if\\nyou&#39;re someplace--I&#39;ve seen the threshold if\\nyou&#39;re above 100 on a fastingbasis, that&#39;s cause for concern.You should maybe\\nadjust your lifestyle.And if you&#39;re above 120,\\n130 after meal, once again,you should also be\\nslightly worriedthat you might maybe\\nare prediabeticor you have some risk\\nof developing diabetes.So if someone has\\nblood sugar like this,they&#39;re probably diabetic.And if someone has\\nblood sugar like this,they should be worried.But once again, I\\nam not a doctor.Don&#39;t take any of\\nthis as advice.This is really just our\\nattempt to understandthings a little bit better.']

      "['Hey, Dr. Berg here.I&#39;m going to talk about insulin resistance.I&#39;m going to make it really, really simple,\\nso just track with me.Here&#39;s what happens.Your pancreas, which is located in the left,\\nlower quadrant, right by your rib cage, makesa hormone called insulin and insulin responds\\nto sugar.In other words it&#39;s triggered by a sugar or\\nanything that turns into sugar, so anythingsweet and anything, like even refined grains\\ncan trigger insulin, and it kicks in thereand it goes into your cells.Then, what it does is it removes the sugar\\nfrom your blood, so that&#39;s the purpose isto lower the sugar.Normally, in our blood, we need about 100\\nmilligrams per deciliter, and basically whatthat means is you can just take and focus\\non the 100, so when you get your sugar testand your blood should be like a 100.The goal is to make it 100.Anything higher is bad.Anything lower is bad.We need a 100.When it&#39;s at 100, you&#39;re at your mental best.You&#39;re feeling the best but when it goes high,\\nyou get what&#39;s called diabetes, so diabetesis the high sugar situation.When the blood sugars go low, that&#39;s hypo-sugar\\nor hypoglycemia, okay.That&#39;s kind of a pre-diabetes state.When I was twelve, I had hypoglycemia.I remember skipping a meal and feeling really\\ndizzy and irritable and cranky, playing outsideand I don&#39;t know what it was but, of course,\\nI was living on pure sugar.I would raid the cupboards and eat pure sugar\\nall the time.That&#39;s really what causes hypoglycemia because\\nwhat happens is you eat all this sugar andwe get this hyper reactive, high insulin state,\\nwhich is going to like take a sledge hammerand push that sugar right down, so we&#39;re going\\nto have low sugar, irritable, cranky, craving,dizzy, all those things.Now what happens over a period of time, when\\nyou&#39;re hypoglycemic over a period of time,your body doesn&#39;t like that so it&#39;s going\\nto say, &quot;Stop,&quot; so it&#39;s going to try to protectitself and it&#39;s going to turn off the receptor,\\nthe thing that receives, so it&#39;s going toignore that insulin response, so it&#39;s not\\ngoing to receive it anymore.Someone&#39;s talking but no one&#39;s listening,\\nand that&#39;s called a down grade or a blockedreceptor, so it doesn&#39;t receive as much as\\nit did before, and that&#39;s what insulin resistanceis because it&#39;s your body, your cells are\\nresistant.It&#39;s inhibiting this absorption because it&#39;s\\nsaying, &quot;Dude, why do you keep eating sugar.Would you please stop?&quot;What happens when this happens is it forces\\ninsulin to go higher because it&#39;s compensating,it&#39;s on a feedback loop here, so insulin resistance\\nforces your body to make make more insulinto create the same effect because without\\nthis insulin, this sugar stays high and yourbody does not like that, so it has to lower\\nit somehow, so it&#39;s just going to wear thepancreas out.Diabetes is really a situation where you have\\nhigh sugar and it won&#39;t come down to 100.We already passed the hypoglycemic thing.We&#39;re, type II diabetes is insulin resistance\\nand because of the, you&#39;ve been eating toomuch sugar.When this becomes like that, your body protects\\nyou and several things happen as a consequence,in addition to jacking up more insulin.Number two, you&#39;re going to be hungry.Why?Because insulin has a few other purposes.It not only lowers the sugar in your blood\\nbut it also helps you absorb the nutritionin your cells, so the nutrients, fatty acids,\\nproteins, vitamins, so without insulin youcan&#39;t get the nutrition in your cells, so\\nguess what you&#39;re going ... You&#39;re going tobe hungry all the time.You&#39;re not going to be satisfied.You eat but it doesn&#39;t really go in, so you\\nhave this fat person that&#39;s starving to death.You can&#39;t get healthy like that, and then\\nyou&#39;re also going to crave carbs like crazy.Just so you know, if you&#39;re craving carbs\\nor sweets, it is literally impossible to burnfat, so every time that you&#39;re craving, you&#39;re\\nnot burning any fat.Don&#39;t worry.I&#39;ll show you how to fix that.We&#39;ve got cravings, hunger and decreased nutrition,\\nand that&#39;s why, over a period of time, diabeticsend up with all sorts of health problems.They go blind.They get their feet start getting, destructive\\nnerves, so it&#39;s called peripheral neuropathyand they get tingly in the feet and the hands,\\nand they just kind of go down hill.Then also, this condition is going to prevent\\nthe storage of sugar.It&#39;s called glycogen, which basically is a\\nstored sugar in your liver and your muscles,so we need that to live off of when we&#39;re\\nsleeping, between meals, and so if we can&#39;tstore the sugar as much anymore, what happens\\nis we end up having all sorts of problemswith storing more fat, if we&#39;re not storing\\nsugar we have to store more fat so you&#39;regoing to keep getting fatter and fatter and\\nfatter.Also, in between the meals, because you can&#39;t\\nhave a storage of sugar, you&#39;re going to havetoo many highs and too many lows, so it&#39;s\\ngoing to come up and down too much.It&#39;s the storage of that sugar that maintains\\na nice level sugar, and especially noted withyou get up in the morning, after not eating\\nfor eight hours.There&#39;s a couple things I want to cover.Let&#39;s go back to this sugar.We need 100 milligrams per deciliter.That would equal about five grams of sugar.That&#39;s like a heaping teaspoon of sugar in\\nyour entire body, on an average person, theyonly need a teaspoon of sugar but not consuming\\nsugar, but from the food that converts tothe sugar, even protein and fat can convert\\nto sugar, so we need about one teaspoon ofsugar.We don&#39;t need more than that.Check this out.An eight ounce, typical can of soda, an eight\\nounce typical glass of orange juice, is aboutthirty-nine teaspoons of sugar.Okay, so now we went from five to thirty-nine.That&#39;s a tremendous stress on the pancreas.Oh my gosh.What you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re just wearing the\\nthing out.It&#39;s creating whiplash of your pancreas, and\\nbecause the pancreas has two parts, one isa hormone part and the other is an enzyme\\npart, called the exocrine gland, you&#39;re goingto start having all sorts of digestive problems,\\nincluding possible pancreatitis, inflammationof the pancreas.Tension in your upper digestive system, bloating\\nfor sure, maybe even pain that goes aroundin your back, undigested proteins.You can&#39;t digest protein anymore.All sorts of bowel problems, I mean you name\\nit.It creates a lot of problems.Now, the body is trying to protect itself\\nfrom too much insulin so it&#39;s going to blockthe resistance, the receptor, create more\\nresistance in there, and then the sugar&#39;sgoing to go high, so apparently the body is\\ngoing to protect the cell and not necessarilythe blood.That&#39;s why the blood starts filling up with\\nsugar and that&#39;s where you get all this extrafat and triglycerides and cholesterol.In other words, triglycerides are blood fats,\\nand because the cell can&#39;t absorb nutritionanymore or protein or fat, it&#39;s going to dump\\naround the rest of the body as, in the bloodas blood fats, out of post tissue and cholesterol.Those are the effects of this situation.We&#39;ve got this hypoglycemia thing, which is\\nhigh sugar, and then the receptor becomesresistant so it doesn&#39;t absorb it anymore.That&#39;s type II diabetes, that creates all\\nsorts of problems, and then down the roadyou end up with diabetes type I and in type\\nI the pancreas is already asleep.It can&#39;t produce this anymore, so now you\\nhave to be injected because the sugars aregoing higher and higher and higher and your\\ninsulin can&#39;t keep up to lower them.Yes, there are other causes of diabetes type\\nI, auto-immune, but the question is what causesauto-immune, that&#39;s another video.The point is that type I diabetes is the worst\\nsituation because now you completely ran outof this whole situation and now you have to\\nbe injected or take insulin.What do we do about this?What can be done?Well, there&#39;s a couple things you can do.Number one, we need to lower insulin.We need to lower insulin.That has to be a primary goal.Doctors do not emphasize this enough.What they do is they give you insulin.They don&#39;t put enough attention on the diet.They don&#39;t realize that in a diabetic situation,\\nin a hypoglycemic situation, if the person&#39;scraving, they should not be consuming any\\nsugars, zero.Don&#39;t give the person recommendations like\\neverything in moderation.That would be very bad, zero sugars.They can do substitute sugars like Zilotol,\\nStevia but they can&#39;t afford to continue toeat more sugar or juice, so number one we\\navoid things that trigger insulin, and thenwe also can increase other things too, primarily\\npotassium.Why?Because potassium will help lower insulin,\\nhelp you store sugar and you want to get itfrom the food, so you would need to consume\\nat least seven to ten cups of vegetable orthe Cal Shake I recommend because it has all\\nthe potassium in it, you can make it.I show you how to, on my website, how to make\\nthat.Seven to ten cup of vegetable to get your\\npotassium that will also really help cravingsbecause it&#39;s going to lower insulin.Number two, you want to increase vitamin B1\\nbut really, the other B complex is vitaminstoo but I recommend getting this, not from\\na pill, but from nutritional yeast.Why?Because nutritional yeast is a great form\\nof natural B vitamins that will greatly assistin lowering insulin.Why?Because when you consume all this sugar, you&#39;re\\nactually dumping all your B vitamins and yourpotassium out through the urine, up to fifteen\\ntimes more than if you didn&#39;t have this problem,so you&#39;re losing all this.Don&#39;t worry.Consuming nutritional yeast won&#39;t give you\\na yeast infection.All right.The last thing I want to recommend would be\\nprotein.Because protein is a nutrient and it&#39;s blocked\\nfrom the cell, you&#39;re probably going to bedeficient in protein so you need to have protein\\nespecially for breakfast, okay.That&#39;s very important because if you don&#39;t,\\nthen at the end of the day your blood sugarsare going to be so far off that you&#39;re going\\nto need, the need for insulin and medicationis going to be much, much greater.I hope I helped you understand this and one\\nlast point.Insulin stops fat burning, in the presence\\nof insulin you will not burn fat, so the goalis to lower insulin and to a normal level.I hope this helped.See you in the next video.']

      "['Every cell in the\\nhuman body needs energyto survive and do its\\ndifferent functions.If we&#39;re talking\\nabout a brain cell,it needs energy to keep\\nstimulating other brain cellsand sending on\\nsignals and messages.If it&#39;s a muscle cell, it\\nneeds energy to contract.They need energy just to do\\nthe basic functions of a cell.And the place that they\\nget that energy from,or the primary source of\\nthat energy, is from glucose.Glucose is a simple sugar.If you were to actually taste\\nglucose, it would taste sweet.And glucose gets delivered to\\ncells through the bloodstream.So this right here,\\nI&#39;m drawing some bloodthat&#39;s passing by a cell.Maybe the blood is going in\\nthat direction over there.And inside the blood, let\\nme draw some small glucosemolecules passing by.And so in an ideal situation,\\nwhen a cell needs energy,glucose will enter the cell.Unfortunately, it&#39;s not that\\nsimple for the great majorityof cells in the human body.The glucose won&#39;t\\nenter by itself.It needs the assistance\\nof a hormone or a moleculecalled insulin.So let me label all of these.This right here is the\\nglucose, and it needs insulin.So let me draw insulin as\\nthese magenta moleculesright over here.That over there,\\nthat is insulin.And the surface\\nof the cells, theyhave insulin receptors on them.And I&#39;m just drawing very\\nsimplified versions of them,kind of a place where these\\nmagenta circles can attach,can bind.And what happens is, in\\norder for the glucoseto be taken up by\\nthe cell, insulinhas to attach to\\nthese receptors, whichunlocks the channels\\nfor glucose.In order for the\\nglucose to go in,insulin has to bind to\\nthe insulin receptors.And then, once\\nthat happens, thenthe glucose can be\\ntaken up by the cell.Now, unfortunately, things\\ndon&#39;t always work as planned.So let me draw a couple\\nof scenarios here.So, once again, let me draw my\\nvery simple version of a celland let me draw the bloodstream\\ngoing by right over here.And then let me draw the\\nglucose in the bloodstream.So I have my\\nglucose floating by,and then I have my\\ninsulin receptorson the surface of a cell.Now, the first thing\\nthat could go wronghere is what if the body\\ndoes not produce insulin?Insulin is produced\\nin the pancreas.What happens if the pancreas is\\nnot producing insulin properly?So no insulin.Well, in this situation,\\nsince there&#39;s nothing to bindto these receptors, the glucose\\nchannels won&#39;t be opened up,and the glucose will not be\\nable to enter into the cell.And this situation\\nis type 1 diabetes,where you&#39;ve got glucose.So in theory, you\\nhave energy and youhave properly-functioning\\ninsulin receptors,but you just don&#39;t have\\ninsulin to unlock the gatesfor the glucose--\\nfor the glucoseto actually go into the cell.The other scenario you\\ncould imagine happening--let me draw the cell again.So there is my cell\\nand let me drawthe blood flowing past the cell.And once again, obviously,\\nthis is just oneof trillions of cells\\nin the human body.We have an estimated 10\\nto 100 trillion cells.So this is a very\\nsimple diagram,but, hopefully, it\\ngets the point across.So once again, let me draw\\nsome glucose floating by.Let me draw some insulin\\nreceptors on the cell.Insulin receptor there, maybe\\nan insulin receptor rightover there.And let&#39;s say we even\\nhave some insulin.Our pancreas is producing\\ninsulin and putting itinto our bloodstream.So it&#39;s there to be used.But a situation can arise\\nwhere the receptors are notworking properly or we become\\ninsensitive or desensitizedto insulin.So in this situation--\\nsometimes maybe itmight be the insulin is hard to\\nbind or, even if it does bind,it&#39;s not working properly.So the glucose will\\nnot enter the cell.I already wrote desensitized.So in either one of\\nthese scenarios--let&#39;s just think in\\na very broad level.I&#39;m not going to go into the\\ndetails of the actual therapyfor these diseases of\\nhow it can be cured.Oh, and I didn&#39;t even\\nname the second one.The second one right\\nhere, as you can imagine,if this up here is\\ntype 1 diabetes,this down here is\\ntype 2 diabetes.The simple way\\nthat-- I don&#39;t wantto say that it&#39;s\\nnecessarily simple,but the way that you could\\nmanage type 1 diabetesis you can inject insulin.The only problem\\nhere-- it&#39;s a big one,though, is that there&#39;s no\\ninsulin in the bloodstream.Everything else is\\nworking properly.So over here, we\\ncan inject insulin.And then you&#39;ll have insulin\\nto attach to the receptors,and then the glucose can\\nbe processed properly.Type 2 diabetes-- there&#39;s\\nmultiple lines of attack.One thing that\\nyou can do-- thereare actually drugs that attempt\\nto re-sensitize your insulinreceptors.You can also do that with\\na combination of lifestylechanges that makes\\nyour body, I guess,more sensitized to sugar.Or you can even-- if\\nthings get severe enough,you can add insulin,\\njust like youwould do in type 1 diabetes.And you can say, wait, I\\nalready have insulin here.Why would I add more insulin?Well, remember, the cells\\ncan process insulin,but they&#39;re desensitized.They would need more\\ninsulin in orderto uptake the same\\namount of glucose.So if you add insulin,\\nyou could possiblyhave enough of a trigger\\nthat the glucose can actuallybe taken up.But there&#39;s multiple\\nlines of attack here,and usually the\\nfirst one are givingdrugs that help, hopefully,\\nre-sensitize or makeyou less desensitized\\nto the actual insulin.So the last thing I just want\\nto think about a little bitis-- well, what happens\\nif you didn&#39;t do this.Well, there&#39;s two\\nmajor problems here.Obviously, your\\ncells can&#39;t functionif it&#39;s not taking up glucose.So your cells will\\nhave no energy.And another problem--\\nif you weren&#39;tto manage either\\none of these typesof diabetes, is\\nthat sugar, if itgets to high enough\\nconcentrations in the blood,it can actually cause\\na lot of damage.Sugar can cause\\ndamage to the body.So you don&#39;t want either\\nof these things happening.You want your cells\\nto have energy,and you don&#39;t want to\\nhave too much sugarflowing in your blood and\\ncausing damage to your body.']

      "['High blood pressure, or hypertensionis a common condition in which the force of bloodon the walls of your arteries is often too high.Arteries are the blood vessels that carry blood away from your heartto supply your tissues with oxygen and nutrients.In your heart, two chambers, called ventricles,contract with each heartbeat to push blood to your lungsand through your arteries to your body.As blood flows through them, three main factorsaffect the pressure on your artery walls.The first is cardiac output,or the amount of blood your ventricles push out of your heart each minute.Your blood pressure goes up as cardiac output increases.The second factor affecting your blood pressure is blood volume,or the total amount of blood in your body.Blood pressure also goes up as blood volume increases.The third factor that affects your blood pressure is resistance,which is anything working against the blood flow through your arteries.Several factors contribute to resistance.One resistance factor is the flexibility of your artery wall.Healthy arteries expand with each heartbeatto help reduce blood pressure on the wall.Another resistance factor is the diameter of your arteries.Your body is able to increase the diameter of your arteriesto lower your blood pressure,or reduce the diameter to raise your blood pressure.A third resistance factor is blood viscosity, or thickness.In your blood, more particles, such as proteins and fat, increase viscosity.If your blood is thicker, your blood pressure goes upas your heart works harder to push it through your arteries.Your blood pressure can be measured with a devicecalled a sphygmomanometer, or blood pressure cuff.When your heart beats,the pressure of blood on the walls of your arteriesis called systolic pressure.When your heart relaxes between beats,pressure on the artery wall is called diastolic pressure.While your blood pressure may change throughout the day,it should normally be less than 120 millimeters of mercury for systolic pressure,and less than 80 millimeters of mercury for diastolic pressure.If your systolic pressure frequently stays above 140,or your diastolic pressure frequently stays above 90,you have high blood pressure.Over time, high blood pressure will damage the walls of your arteries.Your artery wall may become weakand form an enlargement called an aneurysm.Or the wall may burstand bleed into the surrounding tissue.Small tears in your artery wall may attract certain substances in your blood,such as cholesterol, fat, and calcium,to form a build-up called a plaque.Blood flow through your artery decreases as the plaque enlarges.Blood cells can stick to the plaque and form solid clumps, called clots,further reducing, or completely blocking, your blood flow.Damage to your arteries raises your blood pressure even moreby making your heart beat more forcefully.Artery damage and reduced blood flow lead to conditions such as:a stroke,heart attack,or kidney disease.In most cases, the cause of high blood pressure, or hypertension, is unknown.This type of high blood pressure \\nis called primary, or essential, hypertension.Treatment for essential hypertension \\nincludes lifestyle changes,such as eating a healthy diet.If you are sensitive to the sodium in salt, your doctor may recommend limiting your intakeof salt and highly processed foods.Sodium may cause your body to retain water,which increases both your blood volume and your blood pressure.Other lifestyle changes that can reduce blood pressure include avoiding excessive alcohol intake;getting regular exercise;losing weight, if you are overweight;and quitting smoking.Your doctor may also recommend medicationsthat act on your kidneys,blood vessels,or heartto help reduce your blood pressure.Diuretics, commonly called water pills,cause your kidneys to move more salt and waterfrom your blood into your urine,which reduces your blood volume and pressure.Beta-blockers reduce the workload on your heartby decreasing both the rate of your heartbeatand the strength of your heart&#39;s contractions.Several types of drugs act directly or indirectly to reduce your blood pressureby relaxing your blood vessels, which increases their diameter.These drugs include ACE inhibitors,angiotensin II receptor blockers,calcium channel blockers,and direct-acting vasodilators.']

      "['Hey, how&#39;s it going Dave 2d here so when Samsung announced the S 9 and the S 9 plus one of the things that theytalked about really briefly in their keynote was the inclusion of a new heart sensor and that one was really interesting to me becauseIt was the first heart sensor. It was the first phone that could supposedly measure blood pressureWith just a touch which is pretty impressiveNow I mentioned this briefly before in another video and people are like &quot;Who cares?&quot; you know Samsung phones have had heart sensors foreverThis is new the old ones could measure heart rate. Which is basically how fast your heart beats in a minuteWhich is cool, but this measures blood pressure?Which is the...I guess the amount of pressure that your blood exerts on your, the walls of your blood vessels?It&#39;s it&#39;s a veryComplex thing to measure like you can&#39;t just measure itTraditionally you need equipment to do it you need a cuff that inflatesAnd then you need a stethoscope to hear what&#39;s going on inside thereThey have equipment to like speed it upBut it&#39;s not a one-touch process. The other reason why I find it interesting is that. Okay? It&#39;s actually the more important reason is that?blood pressure isOne of the leading risk factors when it comes to cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular disease is the number one leading cause of death,Globally it&#39;s literally like the number one thing that kills people in the world - Cardiovascular diseaseAnd if you have a device, like a phone, that you can hold in your hand that can measure blood pressureLike that that could change the world that could literally save livesSo I wanted to see what this thing could do. I wanted to see if this thing was accurateI want to see if the sensor worked like I thought it would work, and yeah, there&#39;s some good thingsThere&#39;s some bad things, but we&#39;re just gonna going to go through real quickly so to make this whole thing workYou need to get an app it&#39;s specific to the s 9 the s 9 plastic. It doesn&#39;t work on other phonesIt&#39;s called my BP lab and it&#39;s made in conjunction with SamsungIt&#39;s through some University, and it&#39;s the only app that currently uses the blood pressure sensor now this may change in the futureBut as of today in the middle of MarchThat&#39;s the only way they can use this blood pressure sensor on the s9 and the s9 plus okay?so when you set this thing up the first thing you&#39;ll notice is that this is aresearch study and the data that this app measures and collects is used to kind of see the relationship between stress andHealth it&#39;s an interesting study, but I mean I here just for the blood pressure measurementThat&#39;s all I really care about okay, so you have to sign a whole bunch of consent thingsBut it&#39;s pretty easy to get it up and runningNow the first time you use this it asks you to do a base measurement for your blood pressureand that&#39;s where things get a little bit weird the app doesn&#39;t tell you anactual number like you don&#39;t know your blood pressure valueYou just know that that&#39;s your base measurement and any subsequent measurement that you do with the app it just tells you if it&#39;s goneUp or down as a percentage it never actually gives you a number nowThere is a way to get a number into the system you have to calibrate it using external hardwareSo you need a blood pressure cuff or a blood pressure?Machine of some sort or you can go to your physician and get it doneBut you can in put an actual knownMeasurement for your base blood pressure so that the app knows what that base value is so every time youRomesha it if it goes up or downIt&#39;ll kind of just calculate what the difference is and just give you the new updated value so the app doesn&#39;t actuallymeasure blood pressureIt just kind of measures the change in blood pressureSo if you have like a base value that the app knows it can give you a numberBut if you don&#39;t you don&#39;t have an actual measurement so the sensor uses ppg to try to measure the blood pressureit&#39;s basically an optical measurement theSensor has a couple of LEDs and it measures the way that the light reflects off of your fingertip when it&#39;s covering the sensor toObtain a value so I calibrated this thing to my blood pressureBut when I use the app on my family members and friendsSome of them who I know haveDrastically different blood pressures from me the app and the sensor just weren&#39;t picking up proper differences now it is possible or even very likelyThat the app kind of caters to the user like because it&#39;s calibrated to me. It wouldn&#39;t work on other peopleI think that&#39;s very likelybut I did test this thing out in a different way so what I did was I justExercise and exercis does elevate blood pressure a bit and the app does pick up that increase in blood pressureBut it doesn&#39;t seem to be as accurate as a blood pressure cuff nowIt could be a new limitation with the actual sensor like maybe it&#39;s not designed to measureElevated blood pressure from exercise because that&#39;s like not how you want to measure blood pressure normallybut I mean that&#39;s just that&#39;s the only way that I can really test orPretend to test its accuracy now there are other limitationsOne I noticed that cold fingersDon&#39;t work very wellDry fingers as well like I have can some dry hands from the winter and just like it doesn&#39;t always work reliably and the appItself mentions that certain skinned pig patience may not workBut I think the big limitation comes from the sensor itself or at least the algorithm that the sensor is using to calculate blood pressureSo I think it&#39;s weird that it doesn&#39;t measure blood pressureBut it did a little research on just Hull technology and that seems to be an issue with the tech lookThere&#39;s a feasibility study on this stuff, and they&#39;re saying that you could measure the relative variation of blood pressurebut they couldn&#39;t find the absolute pressure value like I&#39;m not even comfortable saying that this thing can measure blood pressure it can measure theChange in blood pressure, but it can&#39;t actually measure your blood pressure at least not with the current iteration of this app nowI think this app and this hardware and this whole thing can get way betterand I think that may be whySamsung is doing this partnership with University like maybethey&#39;re gonna be taking the data from like all the people that have been using this app andUsing it to improve the sensor or the algorithm that is used in thisSensor and like that could just make it better over timeBut right now the app and the sensor feel kind of mediocre to meSo the idea of a phone that you could use to check your blood pressure intermittently is awesomeAnd I think for some very very rare casesIt could technically save a life even in its currentIteration like if you were someone that didn&#39;t know anything about your blood pressureAnd you started using this thing and you notice that it was elevatedYou could kind of do something to monitor or manage that that&#39;s coolbut for the vast majority of people that are interested in this phone like I would not consider the blood pressure monitor aSubstantial feature at least not enough to warrant the purchase of this phone because of that feature okayHope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs.

      "['So recently I went into\\nmy doctor&#39;s office,and I was told that my\\nblood pressure was 115/75.So I thought we would talk about\\nexactly what this means and tryto figure out how to think\\nabout blood pressure in general,using these numbers\\nand this experienceas kind of a launching point.So the way I think\\nabout blood pressureis I always imagine\\nkind of a tubeand I imagine blood\\ngoing through that tube.And this tube is\\nlike a blood vessel.So there&#39;s blood\\ntrying to get its wayfrom one side to the other.And on its way, the neat\\nthing that it&#39;s doingis as it flows,\\nit&#39;s pushing out.So it&#39;s forcing\\nagainst these walls,and specifically what I mean\\nby that is there are cellsand there&#39;s plasma, and all\\nthat stuff is pushing outagainst the walls of\\nthe blood vessels.So you&#39;ve got a\\nforce, and that forceis being exerted on the surface\\narea of the blood vessel.So it&#39;s force over\\na surface area.And any time you see\\nforce over an area,you know that equals a pressure.And in this case,\\nit&#39;s a blood pressurebecause it&#39;s the blood\\nthat&#39;s doing that work.So this is how I think of\\nblood pressure, specificallyas those little blue arrows.And the two questions that kind\\nof pop into my mind anytimeI&#39;m thinking about\\nblood pressureare where is the blood\\npressure being taken,and when are you taking it?So let&#39;s start with the\\nfirst question, where?And by that I mean where\\nin the circulatory system.So you&#39;ve got the heart-- and\\nthis is my Valentine&#39;s Dayheart-- and you&#39;ve got the\\naorta coming off of the heart.And it&#39;s got lots\\nof branches, but I&#39;mgoing to just draw\\none branch, whichis the artery leading\\noff to my arms.This is called the brachial\\nartery going off to my arm.And usually, I&#39;d\\nsay 90% of the time,maybe even more, the\\nblood pressure that you&#39;regetting recorded, or the number\\nthat&#39;s being told to you,is being checked at this point.I marked it with a\\nlittle x because that&#39;skind of the upper arm.So that&#39;s usually where they&#39;re\\nchecking the blood pressure.And again, they&#39;re\\nchecking the forcethat the blood is putting\\non the vessel walls.So these little blue arrows.So that answers\\nthe where question.And certainly, you can\\nimagine if I checkedblood pressure let&#39;s say at some\\nother spot, let&#39;s say over hereor over here, you might get\\na different blood pressurereading than if I checked\\nit at the yellow x.So really were just talking\\nabout that one spot.Now the other question is\\nwhen are you checking it?So for this, let me show you\\na little table or a figure,rather.So imagine that over\\ntime, time is this way,you have different recordings\\nfor blood pressure.So this will be blood pressure.And blood pressure\\nis usually measuredin millimeters of mercury.So I&#39;ll write millimeters\\nof mercury here.And let&#39;s go from 200\\nall the way down to 0.And I&#39;ll use my numbers\\nthat I got from the doctorthe other day to illustrate\\nwhat I&#39;m trying to say.So right at that yellow\\nx, at the bottom,let&#39;s say of my\\nreading I&#39;ve got 75.So let&#39;s start at 75,\\nwhich is about here.As the heart is pumping, the\\npressure starts building up.And it gets up to about 115.So really what is\\nhappening is bloodis making its way from the heart\\nas it squeezes towards that x.And as it gets there, the force\\nthat it&#39;s putting on the wallsis going up, up, up.And as it goes up, it goes\\nfrom 75 all the way to 115.So that all happens\\nduring the squeezing partof the heart cycle.We call that systole.So this is all happening\\nduring systole,which is when the heart\\nis squeezing down,and we know the heart is a pump.Now from that point forward,\\nthe heart begins to relax.So at this point, at 115, the\\nheart is now relaxing slowly.And as it relaxes, the\\npressure begins to fall.And it continues to fall\\nall the way out here.And the pressure gets\\ndown to about 75 again.And this is diastole.So this is when the\\nheart is actuallytaking a break from squeezing\\nand is now refilling,and we call that diastole.So I&#39;ll call that refilling.And so during systole, you\\nspend about 1/3 of the time.And in diastole, you spend\\nabout 2/3 of the time.And I&#39;m talking about\\none heartbeat here.So this would be one heartbeat.So it&#39;s not 50-50.And the easy way\\nto remember thisis in a given day,\\n24 hour day, Ispend about 8 hours working\\nand about 16 hours relaxing,or not working.And so I think of the\\nheart doing its squeezing,its work, for eight out\\nof 24 would be about 1/3.Kind of the same as me.About 1/3 of the time,\\nthe heart is squeezing.So that&#39;s how the heart\\nis spending its time,in systole and diastole.And the pressure is\\nranging between 115 and 75.So really it&#39;s never\\njust 115 or just 75.It&#39;s somewhere between the two.And for example, if I\\nchecked right here in time,it might be let&#39;s say 85,\\nor here it might be 102,or here it might be 87.So it&#39;s somewhere\\nbetween 115 and 75.So this number I wrote up\\nhere becomes the range.This is the range\\nof blood pressure.So when I talk about\\nwhen, it reallydepends on when in\\nthe cycle you&#39;re atand you&#39;re somewhere\\nin that range.And when I talk\\nabout the where, weknow that we&#39;re talking\\nabout a reading that&#39;staken in the upper arm.So those are the\\ntwo thoughts thatshould cross your mind every\\ntime you hear a blood pressurerecording.And of course, the\\ntop number, 115 again,is the systolic blood pressure.And 75 is the diastolic\\nblood pressure.']

      "['Hello, I am Ty Mason of thediabetescouncil.com,\\nresearcher, writer and I have type 2 diabetes.Today I want to give you my Top 10 Best Fiber\\nFoods for diabetes.After you watch the video today, I invite\\nyou check out the description box for my newebook.This is one of the most comprehensive diabetes\\nmeal planning book you can find.It contains diabetes friendly meals/recipes,\\nrecipes for different goals such as 800-1800calories per day meal plan, diabetes meal\\nplanning tips and tricks.There are also tons of diabetes friendly recipes\\nfor everyone!Diana Rodriguez lives not too far from me.She is an amazing journalist and I want to\\ngive her some props for helping me out withthis video.As a group, Americans fall far short on the\\nrecommended amount of fiber people shouldeat every day.This deficiency can be especially harmful\\nwhen you&#39;re trying to manage diabetes andpossibly lose weight.When you have diabetes, increasing your daily\\nfiber intake has many benefits, includingimproving your heart health and helping to\\nmaintain blood sugar control.According to a research review published in\\nthe Journal of the American Board of FamilyMedicine, a diet that’s high in fiber may\\neven help lower your A1C test results, whichmeasures your average blood sugar control\\nover two to three months.“The average amount of fiber consumed in\\nthe United States is only 10 to 20 grams perday,” says Meredith Nguyen, RD, a registered\\ndietitian with the diabetes self-managementprogram at Methodist Charlton Medical Center\\nin Dallas.The Institute of Medicine recommends daily\\nfiber totals based on your age and gender:Men under 50 years old should get 38 grams\\nper dayMen over 50 should get 30 grams per day\\nWomen under 50 years old should get 25 gramsper day\\nWomen over 50 should get 21 grams per dayThe American Diabetes Association recommends\\na goal of 25 to 30 grams of fiber per day.Dietitians recommend eating more foods with\\nfiber to achieve these daily goals, but fibersupplements could also be an option.Why Do I Need Fiber?There are many reasons for including fiber\\nin your daily diet.For starters, fiber helps slow the rise in\\nblood sugar that can occur after a meal.“Fiber also works to decrease cholesterol\\nand provides bulk in the diet that helps tonaturally decrease hunger,” explains Ann\\nWalker, RD, LD, a registered dietitian atthe Cray Diabetes Self-Management Center at\\nthe University of Kansas Medical Center inKansas City.That also makes it a good addition for people\\non a heart-healthy diet geared toward maintaininga healthy weight.Nguyen, who points out that you can experience\\ngreater advantages with even more daily fiber,says you might aim for 44 to 50 grams a day\\nfor the best blood-sugar control benefits.This might seem like an impossibly high goal\\nif your fiber consumption is like that ofthe average American, but with baby steps\\nand good planning, you can get there.Here is my Top 10 Fiber Foods for Diabetes\\nLentilsLentils are colorful legumes packed with both\\nfiber and protein.About 40 percent of the total carbohydrate\\nin lentils is fiber, leading to a lower bloodsugar response, says Jill Weisenberger, RDN,\\nCDE, an Academy of Nutrition and Dieteticsspokeswoman and author of 21 Things You Need\\nto Know About Diabetes and Your Heart andThe Overworked Person’s Guide to Better\\nNutrition.Lentils boast more than 15 grams of fiber\\nper serving, plus nearly 18 grams of protein,according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\\n(USDA).In a hurry?Opt for quick-cooking red lentils and use\\nthem in a soup or salad, Weisenberger suggests.Beans\\nThe trick for reaping the most benefit frombeans?Pick a rainbow of them.A cup of cooked red kidney beans has about\\n13 grams of fiber, according to the USDA;a cup of black beans has about 15 grams; white\\nbeans, more than 18 grams.In addition to their high fiber content, beans,\\nas well as lentils, have a starch that&#39;s resistantto digestion, meaning it doesn’t get into\\nthe bloodstream quickly and affect blood sugar,Weisenberger says.Plus, this starch is good news for good gut\\nbacteria.“When bacteria make a meal of resistant\\nstarch, some fatty acids are formed,” sheadds.These beneficial fatty acids promote better\\nuse of insulin and healthier colon cells.To get more beans into your diet, try tossing\\nthem into your favorite salad, soup, or entrée.Artichoke\\nThis is probably the first time I have evermentioned artichokes in any of my videos,\\nbut they are amazing!Artichokes are tender, flavorful, and packed\\nwith fiber — one medium-sized artichokehas more than 10 grams, says the USDA.They’re also a great source of blood pressure-lowering\\npotassium and magnesium, as well as vitaminC and folate, Weisenberger says.To cook, she recommends removing the bottom\\nleaves and cutting off the top third of theartichoke, removing the stem, and trimming\\nthe thorns from the top leaves.Steam for about 25 minutes over boiling water.Once cooled, pull off the succulent leaves\\nand dip them in an olive-oil-based vinaigrette.Popcorn\\nDon’t reach for a bag of chips when youwant a salty snack —pop fresh popcorn instead.Just go light on the salt and butter (this\\nisn’t movie theater popcorn).OR, try this, drizzle with a bit of olive\\noil, sprinkle on some dried herbs, or adda dash of hot sauce.Three cups of air-popped popcorn contains\\nmore than 3 grams of fiber, the USDA reports.Popcorn is cholesterol-free and has almost\\nno fat and very few calories.It’s also a low-glycemic-index and glycemic\\nload food, meaning that it’s slowly digestedand has a gradual impact on blood sugar levels.Avocados\\nNow I know this is the first time I have evertalked about avocados.While I am not a huge fan, I do like them\\nas a dip.They are good mashed into dip or used as a\\nspread instead of mayo, avocados are a goodsource of both fiber and heart-healthy omega-3\\nfats.One cup of pureed avocado has more than 15\\ngrams of fiber — but also 368 calories andnearly 34 grams of fat, according to the USDA,\\nso remember that a little goes a long way.Weisenberger suggests substituting 1 tablespoon\\nof mashed avocado for 1 tablespoon of butterwhen baking and opting for a slice of avocado\\nin place of cheese on your favorite sandwich.PEAS!I am a huge fan of the pea.These starchy veggies, packed with vitamins\\nA, C, and K, make great substitutes for riceand other grains, Weisenberger says.One cup of raw green peas boasts more than\\n7 grams of fiber, according to the USDA.Split peas are an especially good choice,\\nas one cooked cup contains 16.3 grams of fiber,the Mayo Clinic reports.Toss peas into your favorite salad or pasta\\ndish for added nutrients and fiber, or enjoythem on their own, sprinkled with a little\\nfresh mint and parsley.Broccoli\\nA cup of chopped raw broccoli offers about2.4 grams of fiber and nearly the same amount\\nof protein, says the USDA.Plus, this cruciferous green veggie is rich\\nin vitamins C, K, and folate and the mineralpotassium.Weisenberger suggests steaming broccoli florets,\\ntossing them with a garlicky olive oil, andmixing them into a pasta or casserole or adding\\nit raw and crunchy into your favorite greensalad.BERRIES BERRIES BERRIES\\nBite-sized and sweet, berries are loaded withfiber, antioxidants, and other nutrients.Raspberries and blackberries top the list\\nof high-fiber choices, with more than 7 gramsof fiber per cup.“These tiny berries are loaded with health-boosting\\ncompounds, including those thought to helpprevent certain types of cancer and improve\\nthe health of the heart,” Weisenberger says.For a sweet dessert, enjoy berries topped\\nwith a few dark chocolate shavings.Pick Pears\\nGreen, red, or brown, all pears offer thesame health benefits.A large pear contains about 7 grams of fiber,\\nalong with vitamin C and potassium, accordingto the USDA.“For a fancy treat, drizzle a little balsamic\\nvinegar over slices of a grilled pear,”Weisenberger suggests.Enjoy this for dessert or serve the slices\\nover salad greens at the start your meal.Try Barley and Oatmeal\\nI prefer oatmeal, but I have become quitea barley fan as of late.Both of these whole grains are good sources\\nof fiber.Try barley in place of rice or pasta in your\\nfavorite dishes, and replace breadcrumbs withoatmeal in meatloaf or for coating baked chicken\\nor fish.Both contain the fiber beta-glucan, which\\nimproves insulin action, lowers blood sugar,and helps sweep cholesterol from the digestive\\ntract, Weisenberger says.One cup of cooked barley contains 6 grams\\nof fiber and one cup of cooked oatmeal containsabout 4 grams, according to the USDA.There you have it!My Top 10 Fiber foods for diabetes.Don’t forget to get my new ebook.Like this video and subscribe to our

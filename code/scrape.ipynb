       "{'-32U9eU1hdM': \"Hyperkalemia refers to abnormally, high levels of potassium, in the blood, in normal circumstances, more than ninety percent of the total body. Potassium is intracellular. The remaining is in the extracellular fluid and blood plasma, the ratio of intracellular to extracellular. Potassium is important for generation of action. Potentials and is essential for normal functions of neurons, skeletal muscles and cardiac muscle. Cause this is why potassium levels in the blood are strictly regulated. Within a narrow range between three point five and five millimoles per liter as the normal daily dietary intake of potassium, varies, widely and can be as much as 100 mmol a day. The body must quickly and precisely react to keep blood potassium levels within the normal limits. This is achieved by two mechanisms, excretion of potassium through the kid.  Sneeze and intestines with the kidneys, playing a predominant role shifting of potassium, from the extracellular fluid into the cells by the sodium potassium pump. The pump is mainly regulated by hormones such as insulin and catecholamines. Hyperkalemia is defined as a serum potassium concentration, higher than 5 millimoles per liter. Hyperkalemia may result from decreased excretion, excessive intake or shift of  I'm from inside the cells to extracellular space. Usually a combination of factors is responsible. The most common scenario is a renal insufficiency combined with excessive potassium supplements or administration of certain drugs impaired. Kidney function is most prominent excessive intake or extracellular shift is rarely the only cause mild hyperkalemia is often without symptoms. Although some patients May.  They develop muscle weakness, slow or chronic increase in potassium levels is less dangerous as the kidneys eventually adapt by excreting, more potassium, sudden, onset and Rapid progression of hyperkalemia. On the other hand can be fatal primary cause of mortality is the effect of potassium on cardiac functions as potassium levels. Increase in the extracellular space, the magnitude of potassium, gradient across the sea.  Membrane is reduced and so is the absolute value of the resting membrane potential membrane voltage becomes less negative, moving closer to the threshold potential, making it easier to initiate an action potential. The effect. This has on excitability of myocytes. However, is complex, while initial changes seem to increase, myocyte excitability, further, rise of potassium, has the opposite effect. This is because the value of membrane  potential at the onset of an action potential determines the number of voltage-gated sodium channels, activated during depolarization as this value becomes less negative in hyperkalemia. The number of available sodium channels, decreases resulting in a slower influx of sodium and subsequently slower. Impulse conduction in experimental models, ECG changes produced by hyperkalemia, follow a typical pattern that correlates.  With serum, potassium levels, peaked T wave p-wave widens and flattens, PR interval lengthens QRS, complex widens, and eventually blends with T wave in practice. However, this pattern is present only in a fraction of hyperkalemia patients, and does not always correlate with potassium levels. This makes diagnosis on the basis of ECG alone, very difficult. Given the dangerous nature of a cute hyperkalemia. It  It must be suspected in any patient having new bradycardia or conduction block, especially in those with renal problems. Severe. Hyperkalemia is treated in three steps.

Our video topic is about diabetes skin problems and pictures if this is the first time you visit to our Channel you can consider to subscribe so you won't miss the next great videos from us.  Diabetes can affect every part of the body including the skin many people with diabetes will have a skin disorder caused or affected by diabetes at some time in their lives in some cases skin problems can be the first sign that a person has diabetes in some cases people with diabetes develop skin conditions that can affect anyone examples of these conditions include bacterial infections.  Go infections and itching however people with diabetes also are more prone to getting certain conditions these include diabetic dermo pathy necro biases lie point at the diabetic or mm and erupt example mitosis some common skin conditions in people with diabetes number one acanthosis nigricans. This is a condition that results in the darkening and thickening of the skin often areas of  Tan or brown skin sometimes slightly raised appear on the sides of the neck the armpits and groin occasionally these darkened areas might appear on the hands elbows and knees acanthosis nigricans can affect otherwise healthy people or it can be associated with certain medical conditions. It is frequently found in people with diabetes number to allergic reactions allergic reactions to foods, but  But and medicines can cause rashes depressions or bumps on the skin. If you think you might be having an allergic reaction to a medicine contact your healthcare provider severe allergic reactions might require emergency treatment. It is especially important for people with diabetes to check for rashes or bumps in the areas where they inject their insulin number three. Atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the narrowing of  blood vessels thickening of the vessel walls while atherosclerosis most often is associated with blood vessels in or near the heart. It can affect blood vessels throughout the body including those that Supply the skin when the blood vessels supplying the skin become narrow changes occur due to a lack of oxygen loss of hair thinning and shiny skin thickened and discolored toenails and cold skin are symptoms of atherosclerosis.  Because blood carries the white blood cells that help fight infection legs and feet affected by atherosclerosis. He'll slowly when they are injured member for bacterial infections. There are different kinds of bacterial infections affecting the skin these include styes which are infections of the glands of the eyelids soils, which are infections of the hair follicles and carbuncles which are deep infections of the skin and the underlying tissue  Are also more bacterial infections that affect the nails with a bacterial infection. The area is involved generally are hot swollen red and painful most bacterial infections require treatment with antibiotics in the form of pills or creams number 5, Colossus diabetic or more diabetic blisters in rare cases people with diabetes develop blisters that resemble burn blisters. These blisters called boluses.  Decorum can occur on the fingers hands toes feet legs or forearms diabetic blisters usually are painless and heal on their own they often occur in people who have diabetic neuropathy number 6 diabetic dermo pathy diabetes can affect the small blood vessels of the body that Supply the skin with blood changes to the blood vessels because of diabetes can cause a skin condition called diabetic dermo pathy.  No pathy appears as scaly patches that are light brown or red often on the front of the legs. The patch is do not hurt blister or itch and treatment generally is not necessary. The patches are sometimes called skin spots number 7 digital sclerosis the word digital refers to your fingers and toes and sclerosis means hardening digital sclerosis.

       " '-8HmZjScLe0': \"I have what I need to help, hold me over until Monday.  Kate Farms amazingly overnighted their oral nutritional supplement 'l, drink to me. So I got that this morning and later today. I'll be getting my delivery for my usual infusion and pork here supplies, including the extra fluids for this weekend. I am infusing now.  And I'm just taking it easy. I'm doing my best, not to expend under any energy. So  I'm just,  Doing the best I can. So here's everything that's going to help hold me over until Monday when we can replace my feeding tube got the oral nutritional shakes from Kate Farms, my fluids and the ambulatory pump to infuse the fluids. This is a banana bag with the extra nutrients, electrolytes, and whatnot in no way. Does this, replicate what my feeding tube formula does for me? And I am probably going to get a bit worse before things get better.  But at the very least, all of this will help. I am really thankful Kate Farm sent this to me on such short notice. They overnighted it to me so I could have it through the weekend and this can be used for feeding tube formula. I know people who do use it for their feeding tube. We use their other formula because it's higher in caloric value and its properties are more broken down. So it's easier for my body to absorb, but  This is going to be a good solution for me to sip on because it's really nutritious and I put the others in the fridge since I prefer them to be chilled, but I am going to try this one right now. I got the chocolate flavored. I'm going to try it right now because I haven't tried it yet. So I just took this up.  That actually tastes really good. Awesome. So I cannot do a lot of volume. But at least the few sips, I do manage throughout the day will be really nutritious. And that's good when I have my feeding tube and I'm getting proper nutrition. I still do take a few bites of various Foods throughout the day, but since I don't have my nutrition running I have to make what I in take orally now really count. So I'm only going to be in taking the Kate Farms.  Chanel, shake. And it's just a  Gosh, the feeding tube takes away so much stress. I can feel myself like  becoming a bit emotional because with the feeding tube in my nutrition going, I don't have to worry about it. But now I'm starting to really feel the effects of not getting proper nutrition and I'm feeling terrible. So I want to make myself eat, but I have to be careful, not to give myself too much because then I'll vomit. But I'm not getting enough. And it's just  It's like a vicious cycle.  And it's stressful, but I am so thankful that this will be over on Monday.  I'm sorry, I can't do this. I feel terrible. So I'm going to take a short break from vlogging until I get my feeding tube exchanged. I will upload this video because if I stop without warning, I know some of y'all would worry and with the connection we have. I just I don't want to worry anyone, but until I can get adequate nutrition again.  I'm going to take a break from the Vlogs. Please try not to worry too much, just because I'm taking a break, doesn't mean I'm an emergency situation. I have been much worse off with my gastroparesis. If y'all remember how I was before? I got my feeding tube initially. That was scary right now. I'm just feeling very weak and run down with our jurek. I'm having to use my Walker more.  And just getting out of bed, like, getting dressed taking Harlow out and feeding. It was just  I took so that took everything. I had all the energy and I'm taking a break because  I just don't have the energy to like Vlog and edit and upload and all that. But also this weekend, I'm just going to be staying in bed and sleeping. So there's not much to Vlog. Anyway, and my mom will be here all weekend to help me. Even though drugs, not back yet. I will have some support here and Harlow, of course, right now. I'm just feeling extremely worn out and I'm relying on my Walker more. I'm feeling weak.  I mean, imagine just not being able to eat since when was the last time around my feet since Monday night.  It's not easy and I am hanging in there. But this just really grows my appreciation. For my feeding tube. The tube takes away. A lot of stress surrounding my gastroparesis itself, and a lot of stress surrounding food. It's not that. I choose not to eat. That's not it at all. I love eating. I'm a human being. I love the taste of food. I just physically cannot my stomach is partially paralyzed.  Cannot digest food and if I force feed myself, I'll vomit and I hate vomiting.  I'm grateful for the fact that usually I'm able to take a few bites of various Foods throughout the day on bad days. I can't eat at all on good days. I can manage a couple hundred calories, but it's definitely not enough to sustain myself on oral intake alone. And that's where the feeding tube comes in. I used to be so stressed out about food.  Leading right up to when I first got my feeding tube pleased. If y'all remember that time it was pretty scary. I knew I needed to eat but I knew eating was going to cause horrible symptoms stomach pain bloating like you wouldn't believe. When was I going to hit that boundary where I would eat too much and puke and it was terrible and the worst part of it all was even though I was doing my very best.  Just and forcing myself to eat as much as I could. I was still losing weight. I was still becoming horribly malnourished and I think why I'm becoming a bit emotional right now. Is even though I know logically, I'm going to start getting better on Monday. My body knows that it's going back into that state, and it's just very stressful. Obviously, that's severe, malnourishment happened over the course of a long.  Time. So going like just under a week without feeds is doable and I'll be okay. It's just like a realization of how grateful I am for the feeding to how much it helps me, how much stress it takes away because I don't have to worry about force-feeding myself and getting enough calories. It bypasses, my stomach and goes to my small intestine. Small intestine is proven to be great at digestion, and I can feel strong.  And nourished and get everything I need for my feeding tube. And then that frees me up to eat or really only when I feel capable, you know, I don't have to sit down at the table and force feed myself. If I know it's going to make me feel sick instead. I can just take a few bites here and there when it best suits me. I know I need to continue eating orally because if I don't, I could lose what little function, my stomach has left but  So much stress is gone with my feeding tube. Again. It doesn't fix everything. It's not a perfect answer, but it's the best tool. We found to help manage my gastroparesis and, you know, I was feeling a little sad and earlier, because I was telling myself on Monday, things will get better on Monday. Things will get better. And the reality is there are so many other GP Warriors out there and things are not getting better.  Them. I know GP affects everybody differently, but  At the same time, I know of people who are still struggling with symptoms, even though they have tried every possible treatment. I know people who have not yet, been able to find a knowledgeable doctor and their GP is not well controlled. There are people out there right now who are probably struggling with gastroparesis and don't even know it because it's not a very well-known disorder. I was one of those people who had no idea what gas  Kris. This was until I started the diagnosis process, but this is why I share my story to hopefully spread awareness to hopefully let other Warriors know. They are not alone in their battle and together. Maybe we can foster some more understanding for invisible illnesses in our community to break the stigmas that are out there. And so I just want to say thank you to you all for being so understanding.  Ying and helpful and loving and supportive in this time. And again, I will be okay, until Monday. I just really need to take a break because I'm not feeling it. I told myself that if vlogging ever becomes a chore rather than a passion. I need to take a step back and it's not feeling like a chore per se, right now is just becoming too physically demanding. Like right now, I need to take full focus on.  Body, and I'm literally just going to lay in bed and sleep the whole weekend again. My mom will be here, the whole weekend to help me. So there's just not going to be much to Vlog anyways, and I promise as soon as I'm able, I will pick up the camera and continue vlogging. I will give updates on Instagram. There we go. That's a good.  I don't know what the word is, but a good compromise, so no Vlogs, but there's a link to my Instagram in the description and I will post there.  And again, thank you. Y'all. Are why I do what I do. You are the ones who helped me, share my story and spread awareness and let others know. They're not alone in their fight. So, with much love, I will say goodbye and I will see you soon.\",\n",
       " '-Aj5BTnz-v0': \"What I want to do in this video is familiarize ourselves with one of the most important molecules in biology and that is glucose sometimes referred to as dextrose and the term dextrose comes from the fact that the form of glucose typically for typically found in nature. If you form a solution of it is going to polarize light to the right and Dexter means right, but the more typical term glucose this literally means sweet in Greek if you ask a Greek friend to say Sweet, it sounds like glucose or I'm not saying it perfectly but it sounds a lot like a glucose and that's because that's where the word comes from and it is super important because it is it is it is how energy is stored and transferred in biological systems. In fact right. Now when if someone were to talk about your blood your blood sugar, they're talking about the glucose content. So when people talk about blood blood sugar, they're talking about your they're talking about your glucose content the whole process of  this is all about plants using harnessing the sun's energy and storing that energy in the form of glucose when we talk about when we talk about things like respiration in our in our cells cellular respiration. That's all about taking glucose and using it to full Aunt to create a TPS which are the molecular currency of energy inside of our body. So these are incredible. This is an incredibly important molecule. We can start we can chains of glucose to form glycogen to form starches this along with another similar.  Other simple sugar fructose you can use to form our table sugar but even glucose by itself is sweet. So let's get familiar with it as a molecule. So immediately when you look at this, is it kind of drawn as a as an open chain, we see that we have one two, three. Actually, let me number these we have one two, three, four, five six carbons. So chemical formula would be C sub 6 a subscript of 6 we have how many  Ins how many hydrogen we have you have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 hydrogen's C6 h-12 and then we have how many oxygens do we have? We have one two, three, four, five six oxygens six oxygens so you might notice we have six carbons and then the ratio of for every one oxygen we have two hydrogen's which is really the ratio of hydrogen's two oxygens in water and if we  To really if we really want to if we obviously here we don't have just two hydrogen's and one oxygen. We have 12 hydrogen's and 6 oxygens but it's really good to even just familiarize yourself. What are the different parts here? So we see on the number one carbon. It is part of a carbonyl group. One of the carbon is bonded to double bonded to an oxygen like that. That's a carbonyl carbon eel, carbonyl group and in fact because this carbon it's double bonded to an oxygen but then it's other bonds are too I guess.  Could say a carbon chain right over here and then but it's other Bond right here is a hydrogen we would call this an aldehyde we would call this an aldehyde group and it makes I'll the hide and it would officially make the entire molecule in Alpine. If you contain an aldehyde group, you are an aldehyde so glucose and when it's written when it's drawn as a straight chain or it's a straight chain form. It would be considered an aldehyde and then of course it has all these hydroxyl groups on.  And these hydroxyl groups these oeh groups over here that would officially make glucose. Also, it would officially make it an alcohol and it's neat to keep in mind how the structure is. So you have six carbons. One of them is part of this aldehyde group. It's part of this carbonyl right over here. And then the other five are each bonded to a hydroxyl and when I have oriented this way of four of the hydroxyls are on the right hand side and the one on the three carbon is on the left hand side and  and all of the other carbon bonds are with hydrogen carbon likes to form four covalent bonds. Every one of these six carbons has formed four covalent bonds. And so you would fill up all the rest once you've accounted for this carbonyl here and you've accounted for all of these hydroxyls. Everything else is going to be hydrogen. Now, this is when you've drawn when you've drawn glucose just as a straight chain, but many times you will see it in its cyclical form. It's neat to kind of think about. How do you go from this form to this form over here?  And so what I've drawn here is this exact same this exact open chain, but I've started to I've started to bend it a little bit and just to be able to keep track of things. Let's read number the carbons. So this is the carbon that's part of the carbonyl group. So this carbon one and then we number up from there, two, three, four five. And then that is the number six carbon. The reason why I made these this Bond over here nice and fat is to show that it's kind of closer to us. It's popping out of the page and as we go  From the second carbon to the first carbon. We're going back into the page when we go from the third carbon to the fourth carbon. We are going we are going back into the page right over here. So this big fat bond, this is between carbon 3 and carbon 2. That's this that's this right over here and this going from two to one. That's this Bond. I'll draw a little bit kind of going in and then this bond is this Bond right over here. And so take a second pause the video if you need  Try to orient yourself to orient yourself. Imagine. We're going to take this to the right like this to bring it over here and they're going to rotate we're going to rotate this end and bend it over backwards like that to get to this form. C6 is now bent all the way up is now rotated all the way up there. We've bent we've bent this chain and the whole reason is is because this will typically react the hydroxyl group. This is it this is the the most typical form of glucose. You will see when you see in a cyclical form. There's actually other forms that you can have but that the  oxygen that forms a hydroxyl group on the fifth carbon it can it can attack it can attack the the the number one carbon that forms this carbonyl group and that's because oxygen we've talked a lot about it is very electronegative likes to hog electrons. So this carbon is partially positive and so you could take one of the lone pairs you could take one of the so this oxygen right over here is going to have two lone pairs. Let me just draw them as neatly as I can this one lone pair. And then this is another lone pair right over here.  So this oxygen can form a bond with this carbon when we learn organic chemistry more depth would call that a nucleophilic attack. It sounds very fancy, but it's just the fact that these are drawn to each other's as a partially positive charge. This guy has a lone pairs of electrons that can be used to form bonds with things. And so when that when those electrons form this Bond or bond to this carbon that's going to be this bond this Bond right over here and then this carbon  Can let go this carbon can let go of the electrons in one of these. Let me do some more obvious color and in the double bond right over here. It could let go of one of the bonds the electrons in one of the bonds and then that can be taken back by the oxygen or even better that can be used by that oxygen to capture a hydrogen proton in the solution and actually probably part of a hydronium molecule, but let me just draw it this way. This would just be used to  Sure, a hydrogen proton that would just be a hydrogen hydrogen atom without its electron is just a hydrogen ion. Oh just be a hydrogen proton and that would form this bond that would form this Bond right over here and let me let me just be very clear this carbon this carbon right over here. Is this carbon right over there this oxygen this oxygen is this oxygen? Is that oxygen right over there? And so hopefully you see how  Forms a cycle in your publishing. Oh, wait, aren't we have a little hydrogen attached here isn't know the way I've drawn. It. Looks like there's an extra hydrogen over here. And then that would leave this guy with a positive charge leave it the positive charge, but you can imagine we're in a solution of water that hey I have some I have another water molecule right over here and you know, these things are all bouncing around and interacting in different ways, but it could use let me do that in the right color it could use so that's oxygen. It could use one of its lone pairs.  Set of this this will become positive temporarily but then it can use it can do it can use one of its lone pairs to grab just the hydrogen proton which would allow which will allow this character to take its to take its electrons to take these electrons back and turn into this character and just be neutral and then this this guy would have gained so we have a proton going into the solution you have hydronium, but we took a proton from the solution. We took a proton we gave a proton to the solution and so you could end up  up with this. So the whole reason I did this is just so when you see it in Biology class or chemistry class, you're not intimidated by in fact, this is something that's really valuable to get very very familiar with because you're going to see glucose and other sugars in many many many different molecules throughout your academic career.\",\n",

What is diabetes diabetes is when the body is unable to regulate levels of sugar or glucose causing the glucose levels to go sky-high. The complications of diabetes include microvascular and macrovascular complications these include coronary artery disease Peripheral arterial disease kidney failure retinopathy and neuropathy now, why does it I lose control serum glucose will remember the pancreatic beta cells are responsible for producing insulin insulin causes a decrease in serum glucose. So they're generally two causes to diabetes either low insulin production or increase insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes an autoimmune response occurs where the body attacks the pancreatic insulin producing beta cells in doing so the body is unable to produce.  Zeus an adequate amount of insulin we can test for this autoimmune response by testing for particular antibodies these antibodies include anti glutamic acid decarboxylase and to islet cell autoantibodies and anti insulin antibodies surprisingly. These antibodies have also been shown in type 2 diabetes in decaying that with long-standing type 2 diabetes. There may be an underlying autoimmune process type 2 diabetes occurs due to insulin resistance.  So as a society, we love our fast food and fatty foods me included as her intake of carbs and sugar increases our body tries to regulate the elevated sugars. So our bodies produces tons and tons of insulin after some time the body becomes desensitized to the high levels of insulin and the body has to produce more to achieve the same effects. This cycle continues producing a relative insulin deficiency due to insulin resistance with weight loss and a  Diet the insulin resistance can improve so how do we diagnose diabetes while the diagnosis of diabetes is based on symptoms and lab work. It's important to take a history to identify symptoms of hyperglycemia, like polyuria polydipsia Vision blurriness or changes fatigue and abdominal pain polyuria means having excessive urination. It's due to glucose being spilled into the urine pulling water with it polydipsia means having an excessive thirst and this is  The body's way of trying to regain that water loss due to the glucose pulling water into the urine in terms of lab work. The diagnosis of diabetes can be established if random glucose is 200 or greater with hyperglycemic symptoms in addition a fasting plasma glucose of 126 or greater a to our post glucose challenge of 200 or greater or a hemoglobin A1c of 6.5 are greater is diagnostic of diabetes. If a  I work meets the criteria. It needs to be repeated for confirmation. In addition. There are two high risk groups for developing diabetes these include impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance impaired fasting glucose is defined by fasting plasma glucose of 100 to 125 impaired glucose tolerance is defined after a patient has had a 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test if they're to our plasma glucose is 142 199.  And then they have impaired glucose tolerance. Well, that was a brief overview of how to diagnose diabetes in the future. We will talk about treatment and medical management of diabetic.

The most common is gallstone pancreatitis and what that is is what a gallstone slips out of the gallbladder and gets lodged in the duct that drains both the gallbladder and the pancreas and that back pressure from that obstructing Stone causes inflammation within that pain. Yes and can cause nausea vomiting and pain and the pain can be fairly severe and the illness can be actually fairly severe as well. The other next common cause of acute pancreatitis is alcohol consumption. A lot of Alcoholics can cause inflammation of the pancreas and cause pain and can progress to chronic pancreatitis where they have chronic abdominal pain and have nutritional deficiencies and may develop diabetes. Our pancreas is  very delicate organ and we try to protect it by not exposing it to too many toxins such as alcohol or any environmental toxins as well. So the pancreas has two roles one is the exocrine function and one's the endocrine function. The endocrine function is basically forming insulin to help in the management of our blood sugar's any failure within the endocrine pancreas can cause diabetes. The exocrine pancreas is basically the hormones that are secreted from the pancreas that helped.  To digest fats and help with digestion in general. So the enzymes that are produced by the pancreas are lipase and amylase and that helps with digestion of carbohydrates.\",\n",

So when did body fat become problematic the  Of impacts of being overweight. We're not even noted in medical literature until as late as the 18th century then technological advances coupled with public health measures resulted in the betterment of the quantity quality and variety of food sustained abundance of good food enabled a healthier population to Boom economically output increased and with it Leisure Time and waste Lines by the mid 19th century being excessively overweight.  Are obese was recognized as a cause of ill-health and another Century later declared deadly. What is the distinction between being overweight and being obese a calculation called the BMI breaks it down for us. For example, if someone weighs 65 kilograms and is 1.5 meters tall. They have a BMI of about 29 obesity is a condition of excess body fat that occurs.  When a person's BMI is above 30 just over the overweight range of 25 to 29.9 while BMI can be a helpful estimate of healthy weight actual body fat percentage can only really be determined by also considering information like waist circumference and muscle mass athletes for instance have a naturally higher BMI. So how does a person become obese at its most basic obesity is caused by energy imbalance.  If the energy input from calories is greater than the energy output from physical activity the body stores the extra calories as fat in most cases. This imbalance comes from a combination of circumstances and choices adults should be getting at least 2.5 hours of exercise each week and children a whole hour per day, but globally one in four adults an 8 out of 10 adolescence aren't active enough.  Calorie-dense processed foods and growing portion sizes coupled with pervasive marketing lead to passive overeating and scarce resources and a lack of access to healthy affordable Foods creates an even greater risk in disadvantaged communities yet.

Well, their triglycerides normalized and on the 2 tablespoons a day dose there was a dip and blood pressure but those effects may have just been because of the weight loss other than taste. Is there any benefit to normal-weight individuals?  Sprinkling vinegar on their salad. What about vinegar for blood sugar control?  If you feed people a massive amount of sugar 1/2 cup of table sugar as their blood sugar Spike, their artery function can become impaired and the higher the blood sugar's go the more the arteries take a hit.

       " '00jbG_cfGuQ': \"Themselves with power. Cellular respiration is how we derive energy from the food that we eat pacifically from glucose since most of what we eat ends up as glucose. Here's the chemical formula for one molecule of glucose. In order to turn this glucose into energy. We're going to need to add some oxygen, six molecules of it, to be exact through cellular respiration. We're going to turn that glucose and oxygen, and to six molecules of CO2, six molecules of water, and some energy that we can use for doing all of our push-ups. So that's all  I'm good, but here's the thing. We can't just use that energy to run a marathon or something first. Our bodies have to turn that energy into a really specific form of stored energy called ATP or adenosine triphosphate. You've heard me talk about this before. People often refer to ATP as the currency of biological energy, think of it as an American dollar. It's what you need to do business in the US. You can't just walk into a Best, Buy with a handful of Chinese yen, or Indian rupees and expect to be able to buy anything.  Thing with them, even though they're technically our money, same goes with energy. In order to be able to use it. Ourselves need energy to be transferred into adenosine triphosphate to be able to grow move create electrical impulses in our nerves and brains everything. Well back for instance. We talked about how cells use ATP to transport, some kinds of materials in and out of its membranes. To jog your memory about that. You can watch that episode right here. Now before we see how ATP is actually put together, let's look at how cells can cash in on the energy that stash.  Ashton there. Well adenosine triphosphate is made up of a nitrogenous base called adenine with a sugar called ribose and three phosphate groups attached to it. Now one thing you need to know about these three phosphate groups is that, they are super uncomfortable sitting together in a row like that. Like, three kids on a bus, who hate each other, all sharing the same seats. So because the phosphate groups are such terrible company for each other ATP is able to do this Nifty trick, where it shoots, one of the phosphate groups off the end of the seat, creating ADP or  Seeing diphosphate because now there are just two kids sitting on the bus seat and this reaction, when the third jerk kid is kicked off, the seat energy is released. And since there are a lot of water molecules just floating around nearby, a no h pairing. That's called a hydroxide from one of the h2o's comes over and takes the place of that, third phosphate group, and everybody is much happier. By the way, when you use water to break down a compound like this, it's called hydrolysis Hydro from water and lysis from the Greek word for separate. So now that you know, how ATP is spent. Let's see how  It is minted nice and new by cellular respiration. Like I said, it all starts with oxygen and glucose. In fact textbooks, make a point of saying that through cellular respiration, one molecule of glucose can yield a bit of heat and 38 molecules of ATP. Now, it's worth noting that this number is kind of a best-case scenario. Usually, it's more like 29 or 30 atp's, but whatever, people are still studying this stuff. So let's stick with that number 38 now cellular respiration, isn't something that just happens all at once, glucose is  Then two atp's over three separate stages glycolysis the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain. Traditionally. These stages are described as coming one after the other. But really everything in the cell is kind of happening all at the same time, but let's start with the first step of glycolysis or the breaking down of the glucose glucose, of course is a sugar. You know, this because it's got a nose at the end of it. And like all of us. This is just a breaking up of glucose has six carbon ring and two to three carbon molecules called pyruvic.  Kids or pyruvate molecules. Now, in order to explain exactly how glycolysis works. I need about an hour of your time. A giant cast of finger, puppets each playing a different enzyme and though it would paid me to do it. I would have to use words like phosphoglucose isomerase, but a simple way of explaining it is like this. If you want to make some money, you got to spend some money. Glycolysis needs the investment of two atp's in order to work. And in the end, it generates four atp's for a net profit if you will.  280, peace. In addition to those four atp's glycolysis results into pyruvate sand to Super energy-rich morsels called nadh, which are sort of the love children of a B, vitamin called nad+ pairing with energized, electrons and a hydrogen to create. Storehouses of energy. That will later be tapped to make ATP doubles. Keep track of all the awesome stuff. We're making here. Let's let's keep score. So far. We've created two molecules of ATP and two molecules.  Rules of nadh, which will be used to power more ATP production later now, word about oxygen. Like I mentioned oxygen is necessary for the overall process of cellular respiration, but not every stage of it glycolysis. For example, can take place without oxygen, which makes it an anaerobic process and the absence of oxygen. The pyruvate is formed through glycolysis gets rerouted into a process called fermentation. If there's no oxygen in the cell, it needs more of that NAD. Plus to keep the glycolysis going so fermentation frees up some  D+, which happens to create some interesting byproducts, for instance, and some organisms like yeast. The product of fermentation is ethyl alcohol, which is the same thing as all of this lovely stuff. But luckily, for our day-to-day productivity, our muscles don't make alcohol when they don't get enough oxygen. If that were the case, working out would make us drunk, which actually would be pretty awesome. But instead of ethyl alcohol, they make lactic acid, which is what makes you feel sore after that.  I work out that kicked your butt. So your muscles used up all the oxygen they had, and they had to kick into anaerobic respiration in order to get the energy that they needed. And so you have all this lactic acid building up in your muscle, tissues, ah-ah-ah back to this score. Now, we have made two molecules of ATP through glycolysis, but your cells really need the oxygen in order to make the other 30, some molecules that they need. And that is because the next two stages of cellular respiration the Krebs cycle.  And the electron transport chain are both aerobic processes, which means that they require oxygen. And so we find ourselves at the next step in cellular respiration after glycolysis comes the Krebs cycle. So while glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm, where the fluid medium within the cell, that all the organelles hang out in the Krebs cycle happens across the inner membrane of the mitochondria, which are generally considered the power centers of the cell. The Krebs cycle takes the products of glycolysis. Those carbon Rich pie.  Ooh, veyts and reworks them to create another two, atps per glucose, molecule plus some energy, and a couple of other forms, which I'll talk about in a minute. Here's how first while the pyruvate is oxidized, which basically means that it's combined with oxygen of the carbons off the three carbon chain bonds, with an oxygen molecule and leaves the cell as CO2. What's left is a two carbon compound called acetyl coenzyme, a or acetyl Co a. Then another nad+ comes along, picks up a hydrogen and becomes nadh. So are too.  Roommates create another two molecules of nadh to be used later as in glycolysis and really all life enzymes are essential here. They are the proteins that bring together the stuff that needs to react with each other and they bring them together in just the right way. These enzymes, for example, bringing together a phosphate with an ADP to create another ATP molecule for each pyruvate enzymes also help join the acetyl COA and a four carbon molecule called oxaloacetic acid. I think that's  How you pronounce it together and they form a six carbon molecule called citric acid. And I'm certain that that's how you pronounce that one because, yeah, it's the stuff that's in orange. Juice. Fun fact, the Krebs cycle is also known as the citric acid cycle because of this vary, by product. However, it is usually referred to, by the name of the man who figured it all out, Harden's grabs an ear, nose and throat surgeon who fled Nazi  Germany to teach biochemistry at Cambridge where he discovered this incredibly complex cycle in 1937, for being such a total freaking genius. He was awarded, the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1953. Anyway, the citric acid is then oxidized over a bunch of intricate steps cutting, carbons off left and right to eventually, get back to oxaloacetic acid, which is what makes the Krebs cycle a cycle. And as the carbons get cleaved off the citric acid. There are leftovers in the form of CO2.  Door carbon dioxide, which are exhaled by the cell and eventually by you. You, and I, as we continue our existence, as people are exhaling, the products of the Krebs cycle, right now, good work. This video, by the way, using lot of ATP making it. Now, each time carbon comes off of the citric acid, to some energy is made, but it's not a teepee. It's stored, and a whole different kind of molecular package. This is where we,  Back to nad+, and it's sort of colleague. Faad NAD + NF, ADR chummy little enzymes that are related to B vitamins, derivatives of niacin, and riboflavin, which you might have seen in the vitamin aisle, these B vitamins are good at holding on to high energy, electrons and keeping that energy until it can get released later and the electron transport chain. In fact, they're so good at it that they show up in a lot in those high energy. Vitamin powder that the kids are taking these days and it is an fa dudes are like batteries.  Big awkward batteries that pick up hydrogen and energized. Electrons from each pyruvate which in effect charges them up. The addition of hydrogen, turns them into nadh and fadh2 respectively. It's pyruvate, yields. Three nadh has and one fadh2 per cycle. And since each glucose has been broken down into two pyruvate. That means that each glucose molecule can produce 16 a DHS. And to fadh2s. The main purpose of the Krebs cycle is to make these  Houses for the next and final step the electron transport chain. Now comes the time when you're saying sweet pyruvate sandwiches, Hank, aren't we supposed to be making ATP here? Let's make it happen. Captain. What is the holdup? Well, friends. Your patience is finally paying off because when it comes to atp's the electron transport chain is the real money maker and a very efficient cell. It can net a whopping 34 atp's. So remember all those nadh is and fadh2 is that we made in the Krebs cycle. Well their electrons  Is are going to provide the energy that will work as a pump along a chain of channel proteins across the inner membrane of the mitochondria, where the Krebs cycle occurred. These proteins will swap these electrons to send hydrogen protons from inside the very center of the mitochondria across. Its inner membrane to the outer compartment of the mitochondria, but once they're out, the protons want to get back to the other side of the inner membrane, because there's a lot of other protons out there. And as we've learned nature, always tends to seek a nice.  Peace.\",\n",

       " '0uSKKKrBmaE': \"Pacific adipose tissue, the two types of adipose tissue or white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue, the formation of adipose tissue appears to be controlled in part by the adipose Gene, adipose tissue, more specifically Brown. Adipose tissue was first identified by the Swiss naturalist Conrad gesture. In 1551. Anatomical features in humans. Adipose tissue is located beneath the skin around internal.  Organs in bone marrow. And in the breast tissue, adipose tissue is found in specific locations, which are referred to as adipose Depots, apart from adipocytes, which comprise the highest percentage of cells within adipose. Tissue other cell types are present collectively, termed, stromal, vascular fraction of cells. Svf includes Predator, sites, fibroblasts adipose tissue, macrophages and endothelial cells adipose.  Sue contains many small blood vessels in the integumentary system, which includes the skin it accumulates in the deepest level, the subcutaneous layer providing insulation from heat and cold around organs. It provides protective padding. However, its main function is to be a reserve of lipids, which can be burned to meet the energy needs of the body and to protect it from excess. Glucose by storing triglycerides, produced by the liver from sugars, although some evidence.  Suggests that most lipid synthesis from carbohydrates, occurs in the adipose tissue itself adipose Depots in different parts of the body, have different biochemical profiles under normal conditions. It provides feedback for hunger and diet to the brain. Mice mice, have eight, major adipose Depots, four of which are within the abdominal cavity the paired. Gonadal, Depot's are attached to the uterus and ovaries in females and the epididymis and testes in males.  The paired retroperitoneal Depot's are found along the dorsal wall of the abdomen surrounding the kidney. And when massive extend into the pelvis, the mesenteric depot forms, a glue-like web that supports the intestines, and the omental depot. And a, when massive area extends into the ventral abdomen, both the mesenteric and omental Depot's incorporate, much lymphoid tissue as lymph nodes and milky spots. Respectively, the too superficial Depot's are the  Paired inguinal Depots which are found anterior, to the upper segment of the hind Limbs and the subscapular Depots paired, medial mixtures of brown, adipose tissue adjacent to regions of white adipose tissue, which are found under the skin between the dorsal crests. Of the scapulae, the layer of brown, adipose tissue in this Depot is often covered by a frosting of white adipose tissue. Sometimes these two types of fat are hard to distinguish, the inguinal depose enclosed, the inguinal group of lymph.  Codes. Minor Depot's include the pericardial which surrounds the heart and the paired, popliteal Depot's between the major muscles behind the knees. Each containing one large lymph node of all the Depots in the mouse. The gonadal Depot's are the largest and the most easily dissected, comprising about 30% of dissect table, fat obesity. In an obese person, excess adipose tissue, hanging downward from the abdomen, is referred to as a panniculus.  Panniculus. Complicate surgery of the morbidly obese, individual. It may remain as a literal apron of skin. If a severely obese person quickly, loses large amounts of fat, this condition cannot be effectively corrected through diet and exercise alone as the panniculus consists of adipocytes and other supporting cell types shrunken to their minimum volume and diameter. Reconstructive surgery is one method of treatment abdominal fat, visceral fat, or abdominal fat.  Located inside the abdominal. Cavity pact between the organs. Visceral fat is different, from subcutaneous fat underneath the skin and intramuscular fat interspersed in skeletal muscles fat in the lower body as in thighs, and buttocks is subcutaneous and is not consistently spaced tissue. Whereas fat in the abdomen is mostly visceral and semifluid. Visceral. Fat is composed of several adipose Depots, including mesenteric epididymal white adipose tissue.  Ooh and paranal Depot's. Visceral fat is considered adipose tissue. Whereas subcutaneous fat is not considered as such an excess of visceral. Fat is known as central obesity or belly fat, in which the abdomen protrudes excessively excess. Visceral fat is also linked to type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, inflammatory diseases, and other obesity-related, diseases, men are more likely to have fat stored in the belly due to sex hormone differences.  Female sex hormone causes fat to be stored in the buttocks, thighs and hips. In women, when women reach menopause and the east region, produced by the ovaries, declines fat migrates from the buttocks hips and thighs to the waist later fat is stored in the abdomen. High-intensity exercise is one way to effectively reduce total abdominal fat. One study suggests at least 10 m et hours per week of aerobic. Exercise is required for visceral fat.  Adduction. Epicardial fat, epicardial adipose tissue is a particular form of visceral fat deposited around the heart and found to be a metabolically active organ that generates various bioactive molecules, which might significantly affect cardiac function marked component differences. Have been observed in comparing e80 with subcutaneous fat, suggesting a Depot specific impact of stored fatty acids on adipocyte function and Metabolism, subcutaneous fat.  Most of the remaining non visceral, fat is found just below the skin in a region called the hypodermis. This subcutaneous fat is not related to many of the classic obesity-related. Pathologies such as heart disease, cancer and stroke and some evidence even suggests. It might be protective the typically, female pattern of body fat distribution around the hips thighs. And buttocks is, subcutaneous fat, and therefore, poses less of a health risk compared to visceral fat.  At like all other fat organs, subcutaneous fat is an active part of the endocrine system, secreting the hormones, leptin and resistant. The relationship between the subcutaneous adipose layer and total body fat in a person, is often modeled by using regression equations. The most popular of these equations was formed by durnin and were mercilessly who rigorously tested many types of skin fold. And as a result created two formulae to calculate the body density.  City of both men and women, these equations present, an inverse correlation between skin folds and body density as the sum of skin. Folds increases the body density, decreases factors such as sex age, population, size or other variables, may make the equations invalid and unusable. And as of 2012, durnin and were merciless equations, remain. Only estimates of a person's true level of fatness. New, formulae are still being created.  Added ectopic fat ectopic. Fat, is the storage of triglycerides in tissues. Other than adipose tissue that are supposed to contain only small amounts of fat, such as the liver skeletal muscle, heart and pancreas. This can interfere with cellular functions and hence organ function and is associated with insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. It is stored in relatively high amounts, around the organs of the abdominal cavity, but is not to be confused as visceral fat.  The specific cause for the accumulation of ectopic fat is unknown. The cause is likely a combination of genetic environmental and behavioral factors that are involved in excess, energy intake, and decreased physical activity. Substantial weight loss, can reduce ectopic fat stores in all organs. And this is associated with an improvement of the function of that organ physiology. Free fatty acids are liberated from lipoproteins by lipoprotein lipase and enter the  the adipocyte where they are reassembled into triglycerides bias. Terrifying it on to glycerol. Human fat tissue contains about 87% lipids. There is a constant flux of f fa entering and leaving adipose tissue. The net direction of this flux is controlled by insulin and leptin. If insulin is elevated. There is a net inward Flux Of FFA and only when insulin is low, can FFA leave adipose tissue, insulin secretion is  By high blood sugar which results from consuming carbohydrates in humans lipolysis is controlled through the balanced control of lipolytic be adrenergic receptors and a to a adrenergic receptor mediated anti, lipolysis fat cells have an important physiological role in maintaining, triglyceride and free fatty acid levels, as well, as determining insulin resistance, abdominal fat, has a different metabolic. Profile is being more prone to induce insulin.  Essence, this explains to a large degree. Why central obesity is a marker of impaired, glucose tolerance, and is an independent risk factor. For cardiovascular disease, studies of female monkeys at Wake Forest University, discovered that individuals suffering from higher stress, have higher levels of visceral fat. In their bodies. This suggests a possible cause-and-effect link between the two where in stress promotes the accumulation of visceral fat which in turn causes hormonal and metabolic changes.  Contribute to heart disease and other health problems recent advances in biotechnology have allowed for the harvesting of adult stem cells. From adipose tissue, allowing stimulation of tissue regrowth using a patient's own cells in addition, adipose, derived, stem cells from both human and animals. Reportedly can be efficiently reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells without the need for feeder cells, the use of a patient's own cells reduces the chance of tissue rejection.  Ian and avoids ethical issues associated with the use of human embryonic, stem cells, adipose tissue is the greatest peripheral source of aromatase in both males and females contributing to the production of estradiol. Adipose, derived, hormones include adiponectin resistant plasminogen activator, inhibitor, one tnf.

       " '0vyLi8BVi8I': \"My name is Thomas reifschneider, and I'm a vascular surgeon at Johns Hopkins.  My job is a vascular surgeon basically is one of Education every patient that we see we try to educate not only about their disease, but about what the treatment options are and try to guide them to what would be the best treatment modality for their disease.  One of the things that absolutely amazes me is that people will undergo an amputation of their lower extremity and not get a second opinion before their leg is removed.  Peripheral arterial disease requires a lot of expertise and a lot of experience to be able to treat in the best fashion. I frequently get phone calls from Physicians and family members of patients telling me that their loved one is going to require an amputation and when I see those patients as a second opinion frequently the repair or the or the necessary surgery to save that limb is not as is easily done and something that  Can absolutely change the patient's life. It's much better to undergo a fairly significant operation and save a limb than it is to undergo an amputation.  Many surgeons and many Physicians out there believe that an amputation solves the problem you can get a prosthesis and you be able to walk again and you don't have to undergo multiple procedures to try to save that limb most patients can actually undergo one or two sophisticated operations and save a limb, which will absolutely change their life.  Peripheral arterial disease which used to be called peripheral vascular disease basically is blockage of the arteries going to an extremity. Technically. It could involve blockage of arteries going to the arm or hand. But that's uncommon the most common is blockage to the lower extremities millions of Americans have Peripheral arterial disease. The most common presentation is  No symptoms whatsoever. In other words, they go to their doctor and the doctor cannot feel their pulses. There are millions of people in America who have decreased circulation in their lower extremities, but because they're getting older they're not as mobile. They don't have any symptoms whatsoever.  Those patients we don't typically see as vascular surgeon the more common presentation for patients with Peripheral arterial disease is someone who develops pain in their calves or legs when walking that is called lower extremity claudication in the past. We didn't treat that very aggressively because it's not a threat to the patient's life or limb. However in this day and age where we have  Variety of minimally invasive techniques particularly in the younger patients who have this problem. We may aggressively treat it with angioplasty and stenting the the risk factors for Peripheral arterial disease include smoking diabetes.  High cholesterol and one that we don't really think about but just aging that as people get older their blood vessels tend to wear out.  Peripheral arterial disease is manifested most commonly as no symptoms whatsoever. The the patient's gets a routine physical examination and the doctor can't feel pulses. Unfortunately. A lot of Americans don't exercise enough and if you don't exercise or don't walk very much. Then there's not a large requirement for blood flow to the legs. And so you could have Peripheral arterial disease and not know it.  The most common symptom for Peripheral arterial disease is what we call lower extremity claudication and the term claudication actually means to limp patients don't actually limp with this. But what they do get is they get pain in their calves or thighs after a certain distance of walking. The nice thing about Peripheral arterial disease is that it's very easy to diagnose people with lower extremity claudication have that.  Item every day whenever they walk that distance. It's not like one day they can walk a block and the next day they can walk a mile. It's at one block their calves start hurting or a calf starts hurting consists of consistently every day.  The patients that are the toughest patients to treat are those who present with poor circulation to their lower extremities and severe Peripheral arterial disease these patients can present with a lot of pain in the foot clearly. They won't be able to walk a too far and sometimes they'll actually present with alteration or gangrene of the foot.  These people clearly are clearly need to be treated and or otherwise they could end up losing the function or or actually losing their leg depending upon the location of the disease whether it's in the arteries near the aorta versus the arteries in the lower extremity. These patients can be treated with angioplasty and stenting or they can be treated with lower.  Bypass procedures a totally different group of patients are the diabetic patients.  Diabetes tends to not only affect the lower extremity arteries, but also extract it also affects the lower extremity nerves and the root cause of almost all diabetic foot problems is the fact that diabetics don't have normal sensation to their foot. This doesn't this doesn't allow feedback from their foot so that if they develop a blister they continue to traumatize that blister and tell  Turns into an ulcer and in the worst case is that all sir? Then gets infected and can threaten the whole foot?  Diabetics sometimes we'll have normal circulation to their foot and sometimes they will have poor circulation to the foot. So treatment of the diabetic ulcer of the foot really depends upon whether or not it's infected and then whether or not the patient has poor circulation the treatment of the diabetic foot problem can involve just local wound care it can involve  Partial reconstruction of the foot or partial amputation of toes, toe or toes of the foot and or it might involve restoring normal circulation depending upon the situation in the last couple of decades. The treatment of Peripheral arterial disease is really undergone a revolution. There have been a large number of minimally invasive techniques that have that have really become quite common and are quite  Widely available across the United States and what I'm talking about is angioplasty and stenting angioplasty is inserting a balloon into a blood vessel and opening up the balloon and therefore opening up the blood vessel years ago. You might do angioplasty on a blood vessel that is narrowed. But only narrowed over a short distance nowadays. The techniques are available where we can actually take totally blocked up.  Vessels and be able to reopen them. Generally this this also involves putting in a stent, which is a sort of a metal scaffolding that sort of looks like a Chinese finger trap and that helps keep open the artery over a longer period of time in the worst cases. The patient would need a lower extremity operation or lower extremity bypass operation to be able to restore the blood flow.  The concept is really very straightforward and very simple you have a blockage and you need to bypass from above the blockage where the circulation is still normal to below the blockage where the circulation has been reduced. So the idea is very straightforward. The actual surgical part can be a little tricky at times and most of the time what we do is we create a new blood vessel out of the patient's own.  On vein so you're taking a vein which normally carries blood to the heart and making it into an artery which now will be supplying blood to the extremity as with most procedures in American Medicine nowadays. We've gone to more minimally invasive techniques and in vascular surgery minimally, invasive techniques involve a angioplasty and stenting or reopening blood vessels with a balloon or a little  Metal stent or scaffolding to keep the blood vessel open the real advantage to these procedures are that they're minimally invasive and therefore are low impact on the patient. Most of these procedures are done as outpatients. They can be done under local anesthesia with just a tiny bit of sedation and generally take one to two hours to perform the patients then our are recovered for only an hour or two sometimes three or four hours and then can go home that same day.  Most patients really feel nothing other than maybe a little soreness at the site where the procedure is done which will go away in a couple of days and basically can read resume normal or more activity than previously within a day or two.  Johns Hopkins has a wealth of experience in treating lower extremity arterial disease or Peripheral arterial disease over the last decade Johns Hopkins is added two new Endo Suites, which are operating rooms that where you can not only perform angioplasty and stenting but also all operating rooms where you can do open operations, or you can combine those two techniques. The new Johns Hopkins Hospital will be opening.  Has even more sophisticated facilities for the treatment of Peripheral arterial disease. I think the most important aspect of the treatment of Peripheral arterial disease is having a an experienced surgeon taking care of you. It's not only the techniques involved but it's the decision making that is most in most important aggressive treatment of lower extremity arterial disease will result in limb Salvage and maintain the ambulance ambulance.  Latorre status of the patient\",\n",
       " '0xgeG2gtI0A': \"And foods that does not affect the blood sugar bear in mind that this list has no specific order and the first last or doesn't mean that their best or healthiest and worst or bad or something like that. It's just the way I made it. Okay. So number one, onion and garlic. Onion garlic is very healthy, and beneficial and is actually the food that has less pesticides and chemicals on them of the conventional food. If you feel that organic food is too expensive which makes it cheaper and easier to buy since it's not that big difference between the organic.  Ones and the conventional ones. And I think that's because of the shell that they have. So they don't feel that they have to because that shall is a natural protection. So that's, that's the reason why that is so garlic is really awesome for tons of stuff. It helps for supper with high cholesterol. Poor digestion, diabetes and blood sugar. Of course, that's important for us. Jeast infections boost immune system, increase absorption of iron and sink, antioxidants, cold and flu. It's  Go parasites allergies and so on is like, you know, it's a miracle thing back in the old days. You know, I'm talking like hundreds and thousands of years back. This was used a lot by doctors since, you know, older than, because they knew how great garlic was onions, are very good source of vitamin C, B6 biotin, chromium calcium, and dietary fiber. In addition. They contain good amounts of folic acid and vitamin B, 1 and K. So it's also a great help for deliver. So, you know,  both onion and garlic are amazing and they really helped and I eat that almost every day because I know how great it is. Okay. So number two, let's keep on going leafy greens. You know, this is the most important part of my meals. Leafy greens are so healthy full of micro nutrients like vitamins and minerals and they are very beneficial for the body in so many ways. And they are alkaline, which supports a tremendous amount of Health, especially in this world, where most all normal food is so acid for our bodies. So this is just pure.  For food with no effect on the blood sugar. That's, that's that I use it in the smoothies salads on side, dishes to anything else. You know, I make burritos with the leafy greens. It's just awesome for everything. Okay. So Number Three fatty seeds, healthy sees full of healthy fats, like flax seeds. Pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds. Chia seeds and Alfalfa seeds are super healthy and are very high in fat and protein, and have either no carbs or very low amount of cars, and almost exclusively. All of those carbs are  Dietary fiber and according to my experience with seeds and also according to nutrition data dot self.com which is a huge database with food and their nutritions and information stuff. These seeds have no glycemic load, which is a number that they use to measure how much it affects the blood sugar. So basically doesn't affect the blood sugar at all and but it's super healthy. So, next time you put cereal in your yogurt, replace that with some great seeds or just eat them as the artist.  X. So number four, avocados. This is truly my candy throughout the day. It's delicious can be used in many, many ways and easy to prepare and eat have as a snack or, you know, whatever you want. Avocado is full of healthy vitamins and minerals as well. And also have a great amount of healthy fatty acids, Omega 3 and 6, which is very important. It's also full of vitamin A cek B6 folate and it's also anti-inflammatory. So  That's great. Okay, so number five, coconut, if you eat the raw meat, cocoa flakes, or the coconut oil, you will not have to worry about your blood sugar. Since coconut has a high amount of fat and almost all the carbs are dietary fiber and has basically no glycemic load at all. So I always use coconut oil if I cook something which is very rarely because I'm high raw food either and I also use just eat it as it is like that.  In the coconut oil and the coconut fat is the easy to eat it as it is, but I also use it, you know, you can use it for baking raw desserts of some sort and stuff like that. So it has several use and it's very healthy for you. So it's awesome. You just make sure it's organic with all the stuff here. I'm going to mention that many many times in my videos, but that's very important. I think that's a big Health changer for you. So okay number 6 is nuts nuts, like walnuts hazelnuts, peanuts or almonds are super high.  In healthy fats and proteins as well. They have barely any carb. Which again is just dietary fiber and is very anti-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory. Sorry. Shirt said, nuts are very healthy, great snacks. That doesn't mess with your blood sugar. You know, you can have them eat yogurt as well. But just be a little more careful with the cashew as they tend to have more carbs. But again, it's nothing like a glass of juice or a Snickers bar, some like that, but I've seen a little race sometimes, in my blood sugar, we cast you.  But it also depends how much you eat. You know what, I really go nuts. Literally speaking and eat like 100 or 200 grams of it because it's delicious. And I eat as a snack or, you know, yeah between meals. So, you make sense since the glycemic load is 11 per 100 gram and over. If the glycemic load numbers over 15, it is classified as you know, affecting your blood sugar, so it's close to that kind of limit, but the other ones are no problem, but just to make sure I catch you are.  A little more, but still way more healthy and way less sweet and have less effect on your blood sugar, then glass of juice or Snickers bars or candies like that. Okay. So number seven is herbs like basil, cilantro, oregano mint, lemon balm. And so on, you know, all kinds of herbs are very good because they have basic no macronutrients, which is you know, the proteins to fasten the carbs, but instead have a lot of vitamins.  Girls, so they have no effect on blood sugar, but gives Great Taste to the food, of course, because that's how we usually use them. And they have a healthy vitamins, minerals and a lot of cleansing and healing properties. So, make sure they are ganic a fresh or do as I do. You don't plant your own. That's awesome. Because not only is it fun. I love to have my own plans and take care of them like my own little babies, but it also saves you money. So, you know, if you want save money, plant your own stuff and you used by some  Exceed planet. And then, you can see the whole process, you can be part of it. And like I have my awesome Bassel plant. I take some leaves and then I let it grow more, take some more leaves and, you know, it's great. So make sure you use a lot of herbs in your food. Fresh organic herb, spice it up with because it's going to give you a lot of, a lot of bonus, Health properties, so  Number eight, eggs, a great source of the very essential vitamin B12 and a good amount of protein and fat comes from eggs. No effect on blood sugar, and a great way to start the day and they're easy to cook and ship as well. So, you know, what's not to love. Just be careful not to eat too much. Since eggs are their product, which makes our body acids. So compensate with an avocado and some salad to it. And that's basically what I have for breakfast and I love it.  So here's number 9. Again. This is top 10 foods. That doesn't affect the blood sugar. And even though you might know, I promote a very high alkaline diet for some people orange. Sometimes you have to use them their products and that's okay, as long as it's not more than the alkaline food and not too often if you want to go for a really serious health with that alkaline diet style. So here's number 9, which is butter and cheese and I'm talking real real butter without any additives. Not  Are green so real, real butter that is high in fat and it's just, you know, pure butter cheese is a little harder to mess around with. But even though the animals that the cheese is made from can have been treated badly and been fed growth hormones, which of course affects the outcome of the cheese product. So make sure it's organic here as well. The growth hormones is going to affect the the animal and that's going to affect the cheese where it comes from. So so make sure everything is organic and that's going to benefit you a lot in especially in the long term.  The last but not least. Number 10 is oils. Okay, all these are hundred percent fat and you got to be very delicate and careful with what you shoes. I only use organic coconut oil, organic cold-pressed, extra virgin olive oil or organic hemp oil. I always make sure that it's organic high quality and nothing bogus is in it because using normal conventional would like sunflower oil or Palm.  Boyle and all those other in even olive oil, you know, is if conventional ones and all of those weird, you know, when they even mixed oils are just pure crap and bottles of chemicals shitstorm. Yeah, Frankly Speaking. So but the good ones are fantastic to have in your food to spice up the flavor or if you have to cook and you're not like high raw food like me is great for cooking. And of course my favorite make your own pesto is you know, you need olive oil for pesto. So I usually make my own which is delicious. So I use my  I think olive oil to make it and it's awesome and I can have it for everything. It makes my salad tastes like heaven. So, okay. Now you've been going through the top 10 foods that doesn't affect your blood sugar, and you also saw what health benefits and properties. They have just like a little bonus. So a quick recap number one, onions and garlic. Great body cleansers in so many ways. Okay. Number two, leafy greens. These are just made for everything and is truly superfood. Number three seeds can be used in several ways full of  Great fats and vitamins and minerals. Number four is avocado. And that's my personal favorite. That is perfect, snack or side dish to any meal. And then you have number 5, which is coconut full of fat, delicious flavor, and comes in many ways and forms, like oils, fat flakes flour. And so on number six is nuts, great snack and replacement for candy, and great to have instead of cereal granola in your yogurt or milk, and actually nuts can also come in flour so you can use it for baking and stuff like that.  47 is Herb's, most full of micronutrients instead of protein, fat and carbs. And of course, spice up the food and make it more alive and has ways to benefit the body and your overall health. Okay. So number eight is eggs. It's perfect for breakfast, a lot of uses in baking and cooking and a great source of the essential vitamin B12, number 9 is butter and cheese and it's acid for bodies to keep in moderation. But as you know, has many uses in our lives and cheese is delicious.  Just too freaking everything in my opinion. So full of fat. No problems for the blood sugar. That's it. And number 10, which is always that we also\",\n",

The nutrition facts can be found on the side or the back of the food package.  First, you need to look at the serving size, which is listed at the top of the food label, the serving side listed on this label is 1 ounce.  You may be asking yourself. What does one ounce look like? You can next. Look at this and find that the weight of 1 ounce or 28 grams is about 11 crisps.  We all know that these crisps can be broken in the bag and it may be difficult to count out 11 crisps. So we recommend for you to use a food scale for accurate carbohydrate. If you weigh the crisps on a food scale, you can wait either announces or engrams. Remember the weight in grams is not the grams of carbohydrate. Once you have weighed 1 ounce of crisps, you can look further down on the food label to find the total grams of carbohydrate.  The G counted here, one ounce of crisps equals 23 grams of carbohydrate, this bag of crisps contains 10 servings. So if you eat more than one serving, you are eating more than 23 grams of carbohydrate, for example, if you eat two ounces, you're eating 46 grams of carbohydrate.

You want to eat healthy foods and, and really keep seeing your your primary care doctor to make sure that you are staying healthy so that they can do routine monitoring of your blood and keeping you accountable for your healthy weight and healthy lifestyle. So a pre-diabetic basically means That a patient is their blood sugar is somewhat High. Sometimes it's high. Sometimes it's not it's it kind of fluctuates between a normal range. A lot of times. It depends on what they're they have eaten. If they've eaten really high sugary Foods or are high in carbohydrates, their blood sugar will probably likely be a lot higher than say a normal person's blood sugar after that meal. And but yet it's not so high that it's causing problems.  Yet, diabetes will will affect your kidneys will affect your heart. Whereas pre-diabetes, you might be on the road to that, but not quite there and that's there at pre-diabetes. And before is really what, where we would like to catch our patients. If you are a pre-diabetic, you can definitely change your lifestyle and get out of that category. A lot of times it has to do with just changing your lifestyle changing your Yuri.  Habits and changing your exercise habits or start exercising, possibly just losing a few pounds. Will be enough to get you out of that. That range of prediabetes. There are a few different ways that we can screen for and diagnose diabetes. The most, common one is a hemoglobin A1c. This is a blood test that can be performed that will kind of give us an average of what a patient's blood sugar has been doing over 3 to 4.  A month time period, we do use it for screening as well. Sometimes we'll see that a patient is borderline or pre-diabetic and we can start to take more intensive, preventive actions to help prevent that patient from going on to become diabetic. Risk factors for diabetes would include if you have a family history of diabetes. Also, if you are overweight you are more likely to become diabetic. If you have a poor diet, if you eat, hi.  Sugary Foods or high carbohydrate Foods, you're going to be more likely to become diabetic as well. Other risk factors for diabetes.

And that's one of the things that I realized a short while ago and that's what needs to be understood is that this is not a disease that needs to progress.  But we often tell people. So the that it's a chronic progressive disease, and that's not simply me talking. But if you go to the diabetes association's, whether it's the American Diabetes, Association or the diabetes, Australia, they all put out there that this is a chronic disease and they tell people essentially that you have diabetes you have it for the rest of your life you might as well get used to it, but the problem is that that simply not true and it's actually pretty  Easy to, to prove it.

Well, obviously, it's not true, because anytime that happens, every time it happened, they means that the disease is actually reversible, but you have to know how to reverse it. If you don't know how to reverse it. Then you're just going to get worse in the thing is that the drugs don't actually do anything for the disease in. This is also not controversial.  Cause the thing is that type 2. Diabetes is a disease of too much insulin resistance and that's not controversial. Everybody acknowledges that right. So if you have very high insulin resistance, it's going to cause high blood sugar, right? But that's the symptom of the disease. The disease is actually too much insulin resistance. So the treatments that we give our all targeted at blood sugar, right. That doesn't make any sense because  Cuz it's almost like to give an analogy. If you have an infection, if you have a leg infection, well, you need to treat that infection. So what was causing it was bacterial? You give antibiotics, but that infection can give you a fever but that fever is not the disease.  If you start treating that fever, as if it is the disease, then that leg wound is going to Fester because you're treating the symptoms of the disease and ignoring disease, but that's what we've done with type 2 diabetes. We're treating the blood sugar, but if not, it's not a disease of the blood sugar. It's a disease of too much insulin resistance. So what happens is that, because we're not treating the disease, the disease tends to progress. So if you look at what happens over a period of 10 years,  As 15 years, what happens is that you start off with one medication. Then you take two medications and 3 then you take insulin that more instant and more insulin. And after 10 years, you started with one medication. Now, you're on 100 units of insulin a day. Well, you're taking more medication to do the same job to keep that blood sugar. The same, that means your diabetes is worse. Even if your blood sugar is better, your diabetes is worse than it's ever been. Because you've never actually done anything about  Out treating the insulin resistant so that patient who went and lost weight and exercise and cut out the carbs and cut out the sugars. They actually reverse their insulin resistance and therefore, their sugars came down, which is far different than making your blood sugar's going to go down by force by medication and ignoring the actual disease. So, that's the fundamental mistake that we've made over this last 20 30 40 years.  We've treated the disease of type 2 diabetes, which is too much insulin as if it was type 1 diabetes, which is too little insulin. So you got to understand that type 1. Diabetes has too little insulin. So that makes sense. You should give them insulin type 2. Diabetes is too much insulin. You need to reduce their insulin. But instead we're giving more insulin to a disease state that has too much insulin. Well, of course, I'm crazy.  That's crazy. You had an analogy there as well in your talk. It was saying it's like it would be like treating an alcoholic with. Exactly. So if you have a disease such as alcoholism, where is characterized by too much alcohol, the very last thing you want to do is give more alcohol and that seems very obvious. Right? But if you look in the short term, as you take away the alcohol, they might get the shakes. They might get delirium tremens. If you give them alcohol, they will  Better in the short term, right, but that doesn't mean you're going to make the alcoholism better, right? That's the real problem is the alcoholism. You can't treat the short-term thing at the expense of the long term. What we've done is treat the short-term. We said, well your blood sugar is high. Let me get it Down, Right, but it's like well what's happening to the disease because what's happening to the blood sugar, what's happening to the disease? It continues to get worse. So it's just like that alcohol. Too much alcohol to diseases too much alcohol.  All the Cure cannot be to give more alcohol, right? So typically I give the insolent. What did you say? It's like giving alcohol to an alcohol. Exactly. Exactly. So this is too much. It's insane. In fact, it's not simply that it's not treating it. It's going to actually make it worse. Just like giving that alcohol. You have a disease, which is characterized by too much insulin. You're giving more insulin. You're not making it better. You're actually making it worse. So there's a gain weight.  And they will their insulin resistance will get worse. Exactly. Yeah, and the funny part is that the patient's all know this? Because this is what happens. And I talked to a lot of patients and they say they go to their doctor. They start insulin, then they gained 15 pounds, 20 pounds, right, which is we all know that happen. That's not a secret because insulin is what really drives weight gain. So what happens is that they take the insulin, they gain weight and they go back to the doctor and say talk.  What's this? You tell me, I need to lose weight to get better. Then you go and give me a medication. That makes me gain 20 pounds. This is not good. And the doctor always says something like, well, what are you going to do? You need to take the instant go exercise. Right? But the problem is that it was not the lack of exercise that made them gain weight. It was the insulin that made them gain weight. So you need to treat that you need to reduce it. So what do you do? What do you do? If you're a type 2 diabetic? Well, the thing is that, it's a dietary.  Sea, Sprite, and if you're a type 2 diabetic, it's a dietary disease. It's a disease of essentially too much sugar. So if you understand the like that, then the answer is to get that Sugar out, get it down. So the first thing you need to do is cut out all the sugar cut out. A lot of these refined carbohydrates which are just sugar, and so the Brad's in the past has, right, so they're all chains of sugars. That's all carbohydrates, are chains of sugar. As you eat them. They get broken down into sugar. So if you have too much sugar, if diabetes,  Is essentially too much sugar, you got to stop taking sugar. Otherwise, you're going to make it worse. So that's probably the first thing you can do more exercise, try and burn it off. And the other thing that you can do is try to do something more extreme such as fasting. For instance. You cannot more extreme strict low-carb diet. I love it. Okay fasting tell me more about it. So fasting is actually the most efficient and the most effective weight loss insulin. There's really no drug that does it. There are actually two  They're not very effective to lower insulin. But if you understand that the disease is too much sugar too much insulin, then you got to say, well, if it's too much sugar too much, instant. Let's get rid of the sugar. Let's go to insulin down. How am I going to do that? Right? So the thing about the sugar, you can go on a very low carb diet. A ketogenic diet and that will get your sugar's down, but it doesn't necessarily get your insulin down because the proteins and the fats still raisins them, not to the same degree that carbohydrates do but they still  Insulin. So you can get that sugar down, but you won't get that insulin down. So you can actually put people on various periods of fasting because you're not taking anything. It's not simply low carb. It's low protein and low fat, right? It's nothing. Nothing at all. So think about what's going to happen here. The body is not going to have anything coming in. So what it's going to happen is it's going to start burning that Sugar. That's perfect. That's exactly what we wanted to do. It starts burning sugar.  And sugar after burns, the sugars are sugars, come down. You don't have to take medications. You don't have to take insulin after that. It starts burning fat. That's perfect. That's exactly what we want to do. And there's always two questions that come up when you talk about fasting one. Can I do it? And the thing is you have to understand is that literally billions of people around the world fast on a regular basis through their entire lives, right? So the Muslims, the Hindus, the Buddhists the Catholics almost every  Major religion in the world prescribes fasting. Not because it's super harmful because it's very beneficial. And what they what happens during the fast, is that your insulin levels? Go down, perfect. That's exactly what we want. So what we're doing is, we're burning off all that sugar and getting it out of the system, right, as opposed to just getting it out of the blood. We're actually getting it out of the entire body. So the fasting does both things, it lowers the insulin and it lowers, the sugars, the other thing.  That always comes up with fasting, is it? Harmful and this is what always comes up. Am I going to go into starvation mode? And what's interesting? When you look at fasting, is that studies of fasting show the exact opposite, you don't have less energy. You have more energy. So there are certain things that get activated when you're fasting. So growth hormone goes up for instance to preserve lean muscle. Then you'd start burning just fat adrenaline. Goes up to give you more energy.  G. And you're fueling all that energy with fat because you can measure free fatty acids in the blood and they go up. So what's happening is that you're burning fat. You're preserving your muscle and you've got plenty of energy. Perfect. That is like the perfect treatment.\",\n",

       " '1iB68lO2K9k': \"Alright, another woo. Nice long one for Alicia. Yes, and it's ICD-10, subsequent acute, myocardial infarction.  This example, she saying comes from the aapc quick reference. I want to know why we need two codes. Is the only is this only an ICD-10 rule, a patient suffers from an acute MI of the inferior. Wall two weeks after severing an acute MI of the left anterior, descending coronary artery. He's admitted for a new Mi which is I 22.1 subsequent St. Elevation. That's a stemi mi.  Inferior wall and then I to 1.0 to St. Elevation. That's a stemi awesome Mi of left, anterior, descending coronary artery in this example, the second Mi occurs four weeks after the first. So it is within the four weeks of the first, and is a subsequent Mi coded from the category. I, to to the patient is admitted for the new m. I, so the  Emi is the first listed code followed by the initial Mi. So as she's opening up that answer sheet. What I wanted to know. I had to read this a couple times like, oh I get it. I get it. I understand what they're they're asking is the you know, they have the the heart attack a specific and an ICD-10. Now you can actually tell and code where it is located at which is wonderful, but  Then they have a subsequent one, which is pretty common. If you have a heart attack to follow up and have another heart attack and the guidelines have changed from 9 to 10. Now, you know how we tell. And you may have heard me say this several times pretty much the guidelines between 9 and 10 are the same and predominantly across the board. They are. But there are some significant changes and this is one of them. Okay, so if you happen to have your manual,  You're going to go to chapter 9, that's diseases of the circulatory system. He and then once we're talking about, subsequent M eyes. So when were coding, an acute MI. These are the bullet points. This is what you need to know about an acute. MI. You've got to identify the site with ICD-10. You need to know if it's at the St. Elevation. Is it a stemi or a non-stemi? And we did another webinar on what is the difference between a stemi and a non-stem? You can go out to  You can find that on our medical coding cert because that's pretty interesting. So if though they need to know if it's a non-stemi and it evolves into a stemi, then you assign the stemi. That's a guideline and that's the same in ICD-9 and then if a stemi converge to a non-stemi due to the fact that they give them a thrombolytic therapy where they send the blood out, then you're going to code still the stemi and that has not changed.  Changed. Okay. Now, if the encounter occurs while or and so it says, equal or less than four weeks. Now, heads up. This used to be eight weeks ICD-9. It's eight weeks and they shortened it to four weeks. That is a guideline change significant, then include in this includes transfer to another acute. Setting or Post Acute setting in the patient requires Continued Care for the Mi code from what you're going to do is you're going to  Code from the I 21 and you're going to keep that continuing in the report. All right, so encounter occurs greater than four weeks. You are going to use an Aftercare code versus the i-21. Okay, those guidelines. The only thing that really changed in that is the four weeks, right? And the fact that you're going to continue to code for the initial Mi. Okay? Now, why is this?  It's important. You know, why would you need two codes? Well, the initial mi in ICD-10 tells the location of the Mi is an interior wall. Is it, you know, the inferior wall. Why do they need to know that? Well, if they're going to do a cabbage, if they do want on and forgive me? I don't remember the anterior or the X here. I can show you when you look at a heart, but where the aorta comes down in Arches and I  A picture at the bottom of this, then they will often take a graft Vein from the leg, plug it into the, a order and down to where they need to bypass. Okay, and that's an example of it right there. All right. So if it's that particular part, then that's how they bypass. However, if they bypass, I didn't put another picture up there. If this, this blockage is over there would be on the other side of the heart. They don't do that.  They take a mammary vain. That's right there and goes across the chest and they plug it in. They don't graft from someplace else and pull a vein. They actually take an existing one. That's right there in the area and connected and so that's two different ways to do it again. If you're going to take a graph from the leg, that's additional procedure. So on and so forth. Now, why also do they want to know in this? We are coding for statistical purposes?  As we forget that and it just happens to be a convenient way to get paid. So statistically, they can tell if a person has had a bypass surgery of the anterior wall and this procedure worked then they would be able to tell the recovery wait and what happened after for that patient versus taken like the other one that am a, you know, now, they know, well, this mammary vessel works so much better in this area versus the bypass.  Pass from the aorta and so on and so forth. They know that because it's a sistex now with ICD-10. They can actually get more information because of where the infarction is located. So, it's huge. The information you can attain from these codes. Location is very important. Then now, why would a nymph be important to know what type of initial Mi happen within four weeks of the second one? It's all about this.  Testicles guys, you know, we can improve the treatment by knowing all of this information. So you do need two coats. So going in also, just keep in mind, then ICD-10 the ms-drgs remain the same for the initial Mi or a subsequent one. Just threw that in there and you confirm an initial Mi date in the documentation. Sometimes it's not there. So this is something that as coders and his experts, we will help our  Providers and clinicians to understand. This is documentation a date that's incredibly important to the continuing of care, for our patient in the coding. And the billing, you know, this also changes the way the money comes in because an old Mi after four weeks doesn't carry an HCC for risk adjustment anymore. So again, they won't get paid for that treatment and so it's very important. So I just copied there. The, the codes that we were talking about and you can find them in your coding manual.  But and then the picture of that one particular bypass and how they do that. And so again, very exciting. Yes, the guidelines have changed around this and yes, you do need two codes, and that's why going forward, you will need two codes in that situation. It's very exciting stuff. You do. Get so excited though. Do you need more? Medical certification?  Station training. Go to www.cdc.gov us.  And don't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel for updates.\",\n",

       " '1teEi1piQrM': \"My community education project was to develop a patient education handout detailing how to use short-acting insulin.  The patient that was the trigger for this idea was a patient of mine at st. Luke's Family Practice Center on the south side of Milwaukee. She was a 72 year old Latina woman who had had diabetes for about eight years with never very good control our last couple of hemoglobin A1c. He's had been in the 829 range. She was on the maximally tolerated doses of oral medications that she could take and I broached the idea of insulin a couple of times, but she was really  Be opposed to trying that and really didn't want to go there.  Of course on a weekend when I was out of town. She had a heart attack and was admitted to the hospital in the hospital. She was started on insulin because of not wanting to use her oral medications. She did receive teaching from a diabetic educator while there and was given prescriptions for all the necessary equipment and insulin and was sent home with that, but she called me a couple days later saying that her blood sugar's were running high and into  Thing with her discover that she wasn't using the short acting insulin at all. She was just using her glargine clergy in insulin and wasn't able to quite get to the bottom of why she wasn't using it on the phone. So I asked her to come in for a session with some of our Clinic staff.  Just as a little bit of background on Diabetes diabetes is one of the most common and severe Health Care problems currently facing people in the United States. There's over 17 million people with diabetes, which is about eight percent of all adults and the prevalence is increasing tremendously 13 percent in the last three years alone. Some of this is probably due to increased testing and increased detection. But some of it is also probably due to increasing prevalence mostly related to obesity.  Starting to see younger and younger people even middle school students developing type 2 diabetes and diabetes is very much an issue for Primary Care. It's one of the top 10 reasons why people come to see a primary care physician and it's also one of the one of the biggest if not probably the single disease that cost the most amount of money in the United States in 2007. 174 billion dollars was spent on direct and indirect costs of die.  Abt's that's almost 10 percent of all Healthcare dollars according to the American Diabetes Association.  And diabetics are treated as you know, in a couple of different ways about one out of six is currently treated just with therapeutic lifestyle changes over half are on oral medications alone, but almost 30 percent are on insulin either by itself or in combination with oral agents.  So getting back to our patient she met with a pharmd and a nurse to go over how to use her insulin. I questioned patient is Latina. She's pretty bilingual. But I had a question in my mind if that might be part of the issue but both the pharmd and the nurse that she met with were bilingual and said that she understood English has as well. It turned out that she was very afraid of hypoglycemia. She lives alone and was very concerned that she could get  Mimicking there would be no one to help her so a very appropriate and reasonable concern and both the nurse and the pharmacist commented that you just need a lot of repetition a lot of reassurance going through things over and over so it occurred to us that a patient education handout or some materials that we could give her to both help with the teaching as well as to have some reinforcements at home would be very helpful.  So I started to look for something like this. I looked through patient education materials that were available from the American Diabetes Association from family doctor dot-org which is the patient education website of the American Academy of family physicians from some Aurora resources. Also just did a Google search for patient education handouts on a short-acting insulin and diabetes as also a website which is called to otro Medica.  Dot-com which has lots of information in Spanish.  What I turned up was a number of websites, which wasn't particularly useful for this patient because she didn't have access to them. Some of them kind of went through step-by-step process. We found a number of handouts on how to give insulin itself which didn't really seem to be her exact issue. But nothing very generally on how to use short acting insulin most sites that I came across seem to be written at a pretty high educational level.  One exception being family doctor dot-org, which was pretty easy to read.  So we decided to create a patient education hand out specifically on how to use short acting insulin. We want it to be very simple easy to remember and we came up with a memo Monica of tie for test insulin eat. We wanted to be visually attractive something people would want to maybe put on their refrigerator have some simple pictures and be easy to read and have a reading level that was  minimum for all patients  So the memory scheme that we came up with is tie which stands for test insulin and eat there are lots of handouts that show how to use a glucometer and lancets to check your blood sugar. So we felt we could tie that into existing handouts giving insulin and again lots of already existing information about how to do the injection and then eating so needing to have something in your system to prevent hypoglycemia.  In terms of the process for this we first wrote a draft of it tucked over with one of our pharmacists who suggested some additional medications and also suggested having some sliding scale component to it. We did a readability tests initially. It was written at a 12th grade level and there's it doesn't give you really instructions on how to decrease that so had to kind of play around with that following that most of this High reading level.  From a lot of polysyllabic words and getting rid of a number of those brought it down to a 7th grade reading level and then piloted it with a couple of patients to get their thoughts and input and opinions didn't really get near a very constructive criticism from them, but they did give me some ways that they thought it could be useful.  Some of the challenges that we are encountered where how to lay it out in such a way that it was friendly still kept attractive had enough information, but not too much again how to get to the low reading level how to use words that replace some of those longer words and it sometimes there is no really shorter equivalent.  Integrating the sliding scale was a bit of a challenge to we decided to keep it very simple with just a one step for if the blood sugar was too high One Step 4. If it was too low and then found some pictures and this was actually a little bit more of a challenge than I expected. We found initially a number of pictures that were in color but found that one we reproduce them in black and white the plate of food that looked delicious and wonderful and diverse and color looked like a mash of  It's not really anything when it was in black and white.  So we think that this patient education handout can be useful for primary care physicians who are talking with their patients about going on insulin or who might need it in the future to try to quiet down some of their concerns. It might help the staff time, especially in places that don't have ready access to diabetic Educators or nurse Educators or pharmacist that can assist and for patients. It could be helpful.  a couple of ways one is to reassure that they're not going to become hypoglycemic to kind of keep the order of events in mind and also contains a references for what doses to use again something that they could kind of put on the refrigerator and refer to  some of the limitations of this that doesn't talk about the longer-acting insulin. I guess my experience has been that that hasn't been as much of an issue and that is something that probably could be just written in or added.  It does reference some other handouts for injection and also for how to how to handle hypoglycemia. So patients would need to have access to those as well. Only a very simple sliding scale and the notion there was just that it would get too complicated and too wordy if we tried to put in more details about that.  A problem with using a paper form is that anytime once insulin doses were changed you'd have to give a whole new form or I'll start writing it and Crossing things out which could get pretty messy and just again with the paper format in a full page like this. It's probably not something that patients would take with them.  So some future steps that could be useful for this one would be to translate into Spanish in particular because of the high high rates of diabetes in the Latino population as well as into Hmong. It would be nice to have more culturally diverse patient pictures, although actually that was one thing we're going into black and white sort of blurred those lines, but especially with the high prevalence of diabetes and African-American patients.  And it would be nice to have pictures that reflect other cultures.  It would be potentially useful to have another version that had a more complex sliding scale. So could just replace this sliding scale section with one that had a more specific range.  And finally a really interesting idea that came up as we were talking was that many of the glucometers now really have a lot of memory and it would be interesting to work with some glucometer manufacturers to have more reference information for patients. So it seems like it would be relatively simple to have a hand out like this that was part of a glucometer software package a way to program the glucometer to include the doses of insulin that the patient  On is on it would be ideal to have the sliding scale. For example, pop up telling the patient exactly how much insulin they should use depending on what their blood sugar's were. So overall we thought that this would be a really useful handout that could help with the almost 30 percent of diabetics in this country that are using insulin any questions.\",\n",

There are many of physical signs and symptoms of kidney disease, but sometimes people attribute them to other conditions. Also, those with kidney disease, tend not to experience symptoms until the very late stages. When the kidneys are failing or when there are large amounts of protein in the urine. This is one of the reasons why only ten percent of people with  Chronic, kidney disease know that they have it while the only way to know for sure. If you have kidney disease, is to get tested. If you're at risk for kidney disease, due to high blood pressure, diabetes, a family history of kidney failure, or if you're older than age 60. It's important to get tested annually for kidney disease. Be sure to mention any symptoms, you're experiencing to your doctor or health care practitioner.  In this video, we will show you about 10 possible signs and symptoms that you may have kidney disease. One. You're more tired. Have less energy or are having trouble concentrating. A severe decrease in kidney function can lead to a buildup of toxins and impurities in the blood. This can cause people to feel tired weak and can make it hard to concentrate. Another complication of kidney disease is an  Which can cause weakness, and fatigue.  Two you're having trouble sleeping. When the kidneys aren't filtering properly toxins, stay in the blood rather than leaving the body through the urine. This can make it difficult to sleep. There is also a link between obesity and chronic kidney disease, and sleep. Apnea, is more common. In those, with chronic kidney disease compared with the general population.  Three. You have dry and itchy skin healthy kidneys do many important jobs. They remove wastes and extra fluid from your body, help make red blood cells, help, keep bones strong and work to maintain the right amount of minerals in your blood. Dry and itchy skin can be a sign of the mineral and bone disease that often accompanies Advanced kidney disease. When the kidneys are no longer able to keep the right balance of minerals and  It's in your blood.  For you feel the need to urinate more often. If you feel the need to urinate more often, especially at night. This can be a sign of kidney disease. When the kidneys filters are damaged, it can cause an increase in the urge to urinate. Sometimes, this can also be a sign of a urinary infection or enlarged prostate and Men.  Five, you see blood in your urine healthy kidneys, typically keep the blood cells in the body when filtering wastes from the blood to create urine, but when the kidneys filters have been damaged, these blood cells can start to leak out into the urine. In addition to signaling kidney disease, blood in the urine can be indicative of tumors kidney stones or an infection.  Six, your urine is foamy, excessive bubbles in the urine, especially those that require you to flush several times before they go away.

No bones were broken, but I was black and  Lose all the fire and it hurt like crazy. I watched incredulously as my body put itself back together every day. I got a little bit.

It was then that I pondered the body seems to have the capacity to regenerate balloons the together cuts and gashes close up.  How come does the pancreas not heal? The short answer to the question is probably the problem AKA The Thing. Causing the injury. Never goes away.  Unfortunately, scientists are not sure what the thing is.  Insulin is involved that body. Chemistry keeps Peter cells from healing. It's a feed-forward cycle. So fixing it is complicated.

This model is similar to type 2 diabetes. In the other set. The beta cells were poisoned using structures autism. This model is similar to type 1, diabetes.

The plan involves eating bits and pieces from within you.  Cannibal ization. It sounds rather gruesome, but it's not that bad, the initial bits and pieces, targeted for energy of those that are defective. The magic begins when fasting ends. In this study, the fasting window lasted for four.  Days, actually, these mice weren't absolutely starving. That is only drinking water. They were doing what the researchers called, a fasting, my metic diet, or if indeed, for short calories, were cut to ten percent of normal carbohydrate and protein. Calories were severely restricted.

       " '2YVVfWIoHkw': \"Hello, I'm Tom Mason of the diabetes, Council.com researcher writer and I have type 2 diabetes. Now. I want to emphasize that my perspective is coming from one with type 2 and not type 1 diabetes. Our channel is primarily for those with type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes today. I want to answer. The question is pre-diabetes the same thing as  Metabolic syndrome or Syndrome X after you watch the video. Today. I invite you to check out the description box for my new ebook. This is one of the most comprehensive diabetes meal planning books. You can find anywhere it contains, diabetes friendly meals and recipes recipes for different goals. Such as eight hundred, two 1800 calories per day meal plans, diabetes meal, planning tips and tricks. There are also tons of  Diabetes, friendly recipes for everyone. Now. This is a great question because sometimes the term metabolic syndrome also called Syndrome. X is used when discussing prediabetes, but the two are not the same thing. They're very much different. According to the Mayo Clinic metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions, which does include high blood sugar, but also increased blood pressure.  Excess body fat around the waist and abnormal cholesterol or triglycerides levels that all occur together, which increase your risk of heart disease stroke and your risk of diabetes. Having just one of these conditions doesn't mean you have metabolic syndrome. However, any of these conditions increase your risk of serious disease and having more than one of these, might increase your risk even more. Now, an underlying cause of metabolic.  Is insulin resistance, which is a condition that increases the chances of developing pre diabetes, Diabetes Type 2 and other cardiovascular diseases. So an understanding of the interaction of insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome. And pre-diabetes, I think is critical to making the lifestyle changes that can help you avoid, type, 2, diabetes, and many other health problems. You see, food is broken down in the body into glucose.  It's the simple sugar. That is the main source of energy for our bodies. It is digested into many different macromolecules protein, fat carbohydrates. Then carbohydrates are broken down further into glucose, which is a simple energy used by cells for fuel. Now, insulin allows this glucose to leave the bloodstream into the cells where it can be used as fuel. And the activities of that set up your pancreas makes sense.  Treats insulin, the glucose can't enter the cells if your pancreas doesn't manufacture enough insulin or your sales are unable to process, the insulin that is present in the bloodstream as a result glucose levels become elevated, which sets the stage for pre-diabetes and type 2 sheet issues with too much fat produce fewer insulin receptors, and they're more resistant to insulin in a vicious cycle. The pancreas  Responds by pumping more insulin into the insulin-producing cells that die from exhaustion type 2 diabetes in Sue's. Now when you are insulin resistant, your muscle fat and liver cells do not use insulin properly. The pancreas tries to keep up with the demand for insulin by producing more eventually. The pancreas cannot keep up with the body's need for insulin causing excess glucose to build up in the blood straight.  Many people with insulin resistance have high levels of both blood glucose and Insulin circulating in their blood at the same time. So that is an underlying cause for Syndrome X or the metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes means that you have a higher risk of developing type 2. Diabetes Studies have shown that most people with pre-diabetes, go on to develop type 2 within 10 years unless  They make changes to their weight, their diet, and their levels of physical activity. So while both pre diabetes, diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome have insulin resistance as an underlying, cause they are not the same thing as we stated earlier Syndrome X or the metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions added together pre-diabetes, and the insulin resistance that occurs.  Because of metabolic syndrome does not mean that they are the same thing at all.

However, in this video, I will explain why this symptom may be very important with regard to your health in general and why you should not ignore it.  Tingling hands feet or hands and feet is an extremely common and bothersome symptom such tingling can sometimes be entirely innocent and temporary. For example, it could result from pressure on nerves when your arm is bent under your head as you fall asleep or it could be from pressure on nerves. When you cross your legs for too long in either case the pins and needles effect, which is usually painless is soon relieved by  Removing the pressure that caused it.  In many cases, however, tingling in the hands and feet can be severe occurring at regular times or continuously day and night. It can also accompany other symptoms such as pain pitching numbness and muscle wasting in such cases tingling may be a sign of nerve damage. Now this sort of nerve damage is known by doctors as peripheral.  Apathy because it affects the nerves distant from the brain and spinal cord often in the hands and feet. There are more than a hundred different types of peripheral neuropathy and overtime peripheral neuropathy can worsen resulting in decreased mobility and even disability. In fact diabetes is the number one cause of peripheral neuropathy accounting for well over a  A third of cases in diabetic neuropathy tingling and other symptoms often first develop in the feet and then they go up the legs followed by tingling and other symptoms affecting the hands which then go up the arms about two-thirds of people with diabetes have mild to severe forms of nerve damage.

I want to make tingling and numbness in the feet may be the first sign that you have serious peripheral neuropathy and that you might have diabetes Now diabetes puts you at risk of heart attack stroke, kidney failure blindness and a huge long list of other serious complications.

I mean, I really, really had no idea that this statistic was as bad as it was a shocking 9 out of 10 people who have pre-diabetes, don't know, they have it. I was one of those 9y. Well, almost all medical journals. I have researched on this topic, have concluded that in general terms.  Prediabetes has no symptoms. However, dr. Ashida Gupta says, if you have certain signs of type 2 diabetes in a less severe form, you could have a diagnosis before it becomes type 2. So if you experience any of the following, just one of them, it would be a good idea for you. To ask your doctor to check your blood glucose.  A blurry vision, sudden spikes and dips in your blood sugar which are common in those with pre-diabetes. Can impair your eyes ability to bend and focus leading to blurred vision according to dr. Gupta. The blurriness should go away. Once you get your sugar levels back into normal range.  Excessive thirst one or more well-known signs of pre-diabetes and diabetes is excessive thirst and it occurs in response to the Surplus sugar. In the blood, your body attempts to flush the excess into the urine, which means you'll need to go more often than usual this in turn can cause dehydration making you feel thirsty. Stubborn wounds or infections, high blood sugar can slow your circulation.  So skin takes longer to repair itself. As a result, minor bruises and cuts might take longer than usual to heal. The condition can also promote the growth of bacteria and fungi, which may lead to repeat infections, especially of the skin or vagina like urinary tract infections.  Extreme fatigue, your body uses blood sugar for fuel, but pre diabetes causes insulin resistance, which means your body isn't able to effectively convert the glucose in your blood into energy. This is leaves you with severe fatigue and sometimes even flu-like symptoms.  Sudden unexplained weight gain or loss when the body is unable to get the energy. It needs from blood glucose. It starts burning other things for fuel resulting in weight loss. Even if you're not on a diet or working out, on the other hand, insulin resistance can make you feel hungry, which can cause weight gain.  And darkened areas of skin, high insulin levels can speed the rate at which skin cells reproduce leading to a condition called acanthosis. Nigricans.  It occurs when the scan on the back of the neck under the arm or in the creases of your elbows, begin to darken, maybe even your knuckles and they take on a smooth or velvety feeling. If you feel you've experienced any of these signs, I suggest you make an appointment with your healthcare provider and tell them you have a concern about diabetes. You should then be given at the very least, a glucose screening and hopefully even an A1C test.  You may not have anything, but what's the harm in a small test to find out?

Now, first things first bariatric surgery, cures type 2 diabetes, amazingly a week after the rearrangement.  Into the Gap in someone undergoing, roux-en- y, gastric, bypass surgery, sugar levels have improved significantly since a week after the surgery. The patient is still seriously fat. It actually takes months for them to lose. The excess fat. This Improvement has nothing to do with decreased fat levels.  So what does change? Well, they're eating less, they're forced to biochemically speaking. Their insulin levels have dropped dramatically. So do they lactate and alanine levels? These are the chemicals the liver uses to make sugar. So what is the story with insulin and lactate?  Well, this Story begins with muscle cells taking up the glucose.  As the glucose slips into the cells, a phosphate group is thrown on it creating glucose-6-phosphate with the phosphate attached with glucose is effectively trapped inside the muscle. This means it has to be used and using involves the glucose molecule being quite literally.  Pulled apart in a process known as black calluses. Now, what happens with the bits Left Behind, depends on how hungry the cell is in a hungry. Cell pyruvate is shipped to the mitochondria, as the electrons shoot around the TCA cycle. They generate massive amounts of ATP, which is used to power up the  Sell all that is left of the molecule is a little water and carbon dioxide, but when cells are not so hungry. The bits hanging around. Now, this might sound like a good thing. The cell has a ready to use fuel supply, should this situation change, but there is a catch  Too many pyruvates start to impact the redox status of the cell. The cell is stuck at Defcon 1. It's alive, but barely kicking. They just aren't enough electrons around for chemistry to happen, to maintain a good vibe, the cell must downgrade portions of the fuel stockpile from pyruvate to lactate.  Now generally speaking. It ends up with one pyruvate for every 10 lactate molecules. It's a juggling game and the cat lactate is a wonderer. It likes to leave the cell. It does this with the help of a transporter. It can pop out of the cell and dive back into the bloodstream.  Being a whirl around the body. Sometimes it's scrapped by hungry cells and burned as fuel but a lot of it whines up in the liver. Now, the livers mission is to feed the brain and the body, the arrival of lactate signals, the liver to whip up a batch of glucose.  Quick as a flash lactate becomes pyruvate. Which then whizzes through the gluconeogenesis pathway and Wala. A glucose molecule is made and released into the circulation to feed the hungry.  Cells that are out and about doing the thing are typically hungry, but in the middle of the night, no one is hungry muscles. Definitely. Aren't they taking it? Easy? The other big yukos casler.

So there are genes that have that we're looking at that, don't even have a known function. What do these genes have in common? The immune system, namely, T cells, which patrol the body looking for infections to fight off. They receive signals from tissues. Telling them how to deal with what they perceive as infection based on these signals, the cells will decide whether to go back into the blood or go into a lymph node or migrate into the tissue, that may be infected and start clearing infection.  One of the genes they are working on regulates how T cells respond to these traffic signals whether they should stay in what they consider an infected tissue, or if they should leave and go back home. This Gene called rgs1.  Is faulty in type 1, diabetes, and many other autoimmune diseases. The reason this Gene has been Associated not just with type 1 diabetes, but also with MS and with celiac disease is that maybe it makes the cells a little bit more likely to actually go into a Target organ and start destroying it. And in the case of type 1 diabetes, that would be the pancreas a version of this Gene exists in everyone. It allows the T cells to recognize that their help is needed in infected or inflamed tissue a natural response to an illness or  Injury. But as with every Gene in the body, there are minor tweaks that make it carry out its function, slightly differently in your body than in someone else's. We are all 99. But nine point, nine percent identical, but we have millions of very small differences that for the most part inconsequential. But then, there are a lot of obvious differences. You have brown hair, blond hair, you have brown eyes. I have blue eyes, and these are all you to these small variations. So, we have the same eyes, just use a brand in mind, a blue and the same goes for this Gene. The function is not significant.  Any different. It's just that by a small variation in one person. It might be a little bit more active and another one. It might be a little bit less active. They think, if they could turn down the activity on that overactive, rgs1 Gene associated, with type 1 diabetes, they could make the T cells more likely to come out of the pancreas or less likely to go into the pancreas at all. What we're dealing with is really just stopping the immune system from killing these cells. So rather than completely preventing them from going in there because you wouldn't want to do that. Imagine. If you had an infection, the cells can't go there, they come.  Clearly infection that would be pretty bad. But just making them more likely to return to the bloodstream once they've done their job if they actually did have a genuine reason for being in there by turning down this Jean. They're hoping to make the T cells more responsive to the signals telling them to go home. Making them less likely to get stuck in the pancreas mounting endless attacks on the insulin-secreting beta cells. And so we're just at the point now where we've started testing T cells and we've confirmed that. In fact, when we do inhibit this Gene we do.  See these cells migrate differently. They first carried out, these experiments in a culture dish. Where they mix together T cells with the rgs1 gene at full power and T cells with the rgs1 gene turned down. They made the reduced rgs1 cells. Fluoresce, green under certain lighting to be able to tell them apart and we make them migrate in the dish and we can see that they migrate differently. When we turn the gene off versus one day. The gene is on. And so this confirms the system works and we're very confident now that when we do these disease studies, we will see a difference. The  Studies, which have recently been supported by a large JDRF. Grant will start soon in animal models. They turn off the gene in an animal by inserting a harmless virus into a fertilized egg. When that egg becomes a mouse, they are able to activate the virus with a simple antibiotic in the drinking water, which turns the gene on or off mimicking, human drug treatments. The beauty of this model is that it's in the usable. So then we could manipulate the expression of rgs1 at different stages. And then we can see the role of this protein.  And the onset and the progression of the disease, we are going to knock down RGS at different time points. So we're going to block rgs1 expression early on or we're going to block RGS expression. Once the symptoms of start curing with the hopes that first of all, we see if there is any kind of differential developing of the disease. It might show a direct link to diabetes onset. But once diabetes is established. We want to know if we block this rgs1, then we can  Revert, the progression of the disease. If rgs1 proves to have an effect on Diabetes onset and progression first an animal. And then, in human trials, the transition to a drug therapy could be smooth genes, that are relatives of rgs1 have been targeted by drugs before so dr. Kessler and his team know, it'd be possible to get it rgs1. We just hope that we could help Advance. First of all, the knowledge about this Gene in the context of lymphocytes in the context of diabetes.  Just very optimistic that we will figure out how how diabetes developed. I mean, it's, you know, it's a long haul effort. It's not going to happen overnight, but we went on our way and with this, these new jeans. I've been uncovered. We now have so much more information to go after so that I think with our new systems and in collaboration with other investigators here at Harvard Medical School and Joseline, I think we're going to make some good Headway and hopefully come up with some new strategies to prevent or cure type 1 diabetes.\",\n",
       " '3lMehvXSJWU': \"Acute pancreatitis is the sudden inflammation in hemorrhaging of the pancreas due to destruction by its own digestive enzymes, a process fittingly called Auto digestion. Most of the time the disease is actually relatively mild, but it can easily become severe. So it's critical to diagnose and treat it quickly.  The pancreas is a long skinny gland, the length of a dollar bill and is located in the upper abdomen, or the epigastric region behind the stomach.  It plays endocrine roles, for example, Alpha and beta cells, make hormones, like insulin and glucagon that are secreted into the blood stream. But it also plays exocrine roles. For example, acinar cells, make digestive enzymes that are secreted into the duodenum to help digest food.  These pancreatic digestive enzymes break down macromolecules, like carbohydrates lipids and proteins found in food, but these macromolecules are also found in the cells of the pancreas.  To protect the pancreas, the acinar cells manufacture, inactive forms of the enzymes called Pro enzymes or zymogens. These zymogens are normally activated by proteases which cleave off a polypeptide chain, which is kind of like pulling the pin out of a grenade for additional security. The zymogens are kept away from sensitive tissues in storage. Vesicles called zymogen, granules and are packaged with protease Inhibitors that prevent enzymes from doing damage if they become prematurely.  To digest a meal. These images are released into the pancreatic duct and delivered to the small intestine where they're activated by the protease trypsin.  Trypsin is a pancreatic digestive enzyme, that's produced as the zymogen trypsinogen.  Normally trypsinogen isn't activated until it's cleaved by protease in Taro peptidase, which is found in the duodenum.  But if trypsinogen and these zymogens become activated too early, then it can cause acute pancreatitis.  This might happen as a result of any injury to the acinar cells, or anything that prevents the normal secretion of the pro enzymes into the duodenum. The two leading causes of acute pancreatitis are alcohol abuse in gallstones.  With alcohol, abuse, it goes like this. Alcohol increases zymogen secretion from acinar cells. While decreasing fluid and bicarbonate production from the ductal epithelial cells as a result. The pancreatic juice has become really thick and viscous potentially forming a plug that can block the duct. A blocked, duct is bad news because pancreatic juices start backing up increasing the pressure and leading to distension of the duct itself.  At the cellular level. One consequence of this. Is that membrane trafficking becomes chaotic. Zymogen, granules might fuse with lysosomes which brings trypsinogen into contact with lysosomal digestive enzymes.  Trypsinogen might then be turned into activated trypsin which Begins the Cascade of digestive enzyme activation and auto digestion of the pancreas, which is acute pancreatitis.  Alcohol. Also contributes to pancreatitis and other ways though, for example, stimulating acinar cells to release inflammatory cytokines, which attracts a strong immune reaction neutrophils arrive quickly to the scene and often release, superoxide another proteases, which contribute to the problem.  Finally, it's not that high consumption and subsequent oxidative metabolism of alcohol. Might produce enough reactive oxygen species to overwhelm cellular defenses in damage the cells with gallstones. What happens is that they sometimes get lodged in the sphincter of oddi, which blocks the release of pancreatic juices, which is pretty similar to the alcohol-induced protein plug.  But the causes of acute pancreatitis are varied, and most of the important ones can be remembered by the mnemonic. I get smashed where I refers to unknown, or idiopathic causes G is obstruction by gallstones. She is ethanol. Abuse T is pancreatic trauma, which is more likely if the trauma is the result of a puncture injury, Like a Knife wound. Not a punch, s is the use of steroids.  M is an infection of the mumps virus a is the result of autoimmune diseases. The second s is the result of scorpion sting, which is probably the most exciting item on this list, but also one of the more rare causes H is a cheat and stands for both hypertriglyceridemia and for hypercalcemia.  She is Trauma from a procedure called an endoscopic, retrograde cholangiopancreatography, or ercp, which is a technique used to diagnose and treat various biliary and pancreatic diseases. And finally, d stands for drugs, like sulfa drugs, reverse transcriptase Inhibitors and protease inhibitors.  So in acute pancreatitis, there's pancreatic tissue destruction that results from the proteases and inflammatory responses of the body. And this can cause tiny blood vessels to become leaky and sometimes rupture ultimately all this extra fluid or edema causes the capsule. The pancreas is swell, and unfortunately, there could be some activation of lipase has which go on to destroy the fat around the pancreas or para pancreatic fat, all of this digestion and bleeding can actually liquefy. The  Tissue a process called liquefaction of hemorrhagic necrosis. In addition, to destroying the pancreas pancreatitis can cause serious complications. Like, the formation of a pancreatic. Pseudocyst, a pancreatic pseudocyst forms, when fibrous tissue surrounds the liquefaction of necrotic tissue of the pancreas and this fibrous tissue develops. A cavity that fills up with pancreatic juice.  Abdominal pain, loss of appetite. And a palpable tender Mass, which follows a bout of acute. Pancreatitis are suggestive of a pancreatic pseudocyst in addition serum, amylase lipase and bilirubin might sometimes be elevated an abdominal CT scans. The best way to image a pancreatic pseudocyst.  since they swell in size, pancreatic pseudocyst, have the potential to rupture, which causes Hemorrhage, and a release of pancreatic enzymes into the abdominal cavity, which will lead to a massive inflammatory reaction that pseudocyst can also get infected Often by E, coli and turn into a very dangerous pancreatic abscess this presents, similarly, to a pseudo sis, but with the Hallmarks of an infection, including a high fever and high white blood cell count,  Other complications of acute pancreatitis includes serious, internal bleeding or Hemorrhage from a damaged blood vessel, which can quickly develop into hypovolemic shock. Another troubling. Complication is systemic activation of blood coagulation factors or disseminated, intravascular coagulation, or D IC or tiny blood. Clots start to develop throughout the body using up, all the clotting factors, which paradoxically make it easier to bleed as well. Basically, upsetting the balance of clotting, homeostasis and potentially,  Imaging, various vital organs.  Finally acute pancreatitis can lead to acute. Respiratory distress syndrome, or ar DS, which is where massive pancreatic inflammation leads to Leaky blood vessels throughout the body, which makes it hard to breathe.  AR DS is the leading cause of death among people with acute pancreatitis.  In addition, to General symptoms, like, nausea and vomiting. Another distinctive sign of acute. Pancreatitis is hypocalcemia, particularly when there's a lot of fat necrosis, because that process tends to consume calcium.  There might also be bruising around the belly button or the Perry umbilical region called Cullen sign and along. The flank of the body, which is between the hip bone and the rips called grey Turner's sign. These happen as necrosis. Induced hemorrhaging spreads the soft tissues of those body areas.  Diagnosis of acute, pancreatitis can be made based on clinical findings lab data and imaging. The first clinical clue is intense pain in the epigastric region, which can radiate to the back. Lab data would show an increase in serum. Digestive enzymes including amylase and lipase of which lipase is more specific to pancreatitis. Finally. An Imaging study like a CT scan might show evidence of pancreatitis, like, inflammation necrosis in the formation of pseudo, cysts.  And while it's not directly diagnostic, you can also use ultrasound to look for offending gallstones if they're suspected.  Treatment of acute pancreatitis is focused on pain control and making sure that the person is getting adequate fluids and electrolytes generally. Speaking one treatment goal is to rest the bowels. So many individuals are therefore told to avoid food and get nourished through IV fluids instead. Finally. It's very important to treat the complications by offering things like oxygen therapy and antibiotics as needed.  All right, as a quick recap, your pancreas produces both hormones for the endocrine system and digestive enzymes for the exocrine system when the pancreatic acinar cells are damaged or the pancreatic ducts are blocked often because of alcohol abuse or gallstones the inactive, zymogens that the pancreas produces can be prematurely converted to active digestive enzymes.  Acute pancreatitis happens when these enzymes digest the pancreas.  Thanks for watching.

Calorie restriction is at the heart of anorexia becomes a problem of excessive calories. If you drink this, you will not feel hungry and it did help me eat less. Basically, you're not supposed to exceed 500 calories a day when I cut its calories by 50% of not more than 500 calories, and you're going to see, you know, your way in your fat really start dropping quickly, and Apple for breakfast, one of the strategies of why you eat less throughout the day and you  Have two meals that I like to order appetizers as my meal.

Needs about 1400 to 2200 calories a day. So these YouTubers are all promoting self starvation. This mentality of trying to starve yourself in order to lose weight is incredibly destructive. The reason why this concept is so popular.  Because it gives quick, short term results. We've all been conditioned to believe that weight loss can be achieved in 3 days or in a 12 week program and it's just not right off. I would say those aren't healthy diets, right? If you have to control stop your hey, I would like another piece of that but I can't because I'm going to get fat. I would say you're not on a healthy diet. Then the truth is these stupid stuff. Vation fats are incredibly unhealthy and not sustainable long-term.  So yeah, you might lose 20 pounds in a month, but eventually you'll crash and binge and gain even more weight than before and the destructive cycle continues.  And what happens with these fad diets is why they make you feel worse as well. Is that you try and do them? Okay, you try and do them for a couple of months or you might maintain it for a couple of months, but then you find it increasingly difficult. You're like, fuck. This is so hard because you're starving yourself and you eventually binge out big time like crazy. You can't get enough food in your like stuffing. It stuffing, stuffing it, and then, you know what you feel worse than ever. You feel so disgusted in yourself. I've been there before a million.  And that is not loving yourself. That's not really being loving, is it? And then you blame yourself. You like? I'm so undisciplined. I'm so hopeless. Why can't I stick to this diet? It's not your fault. You need to understand that it is not your fault. Okay, no. One can stick to these starvation diets, and these calorie restrictive diets rely heavily on appetite suppressants. I take 125 IU per day now, that's how much I inject and I experience.  Hunger, the green tea. Cayenne pepper vinegar, you can have coffee and tea in any quantity. And so what I did was I thought drinking this thing three times a day and I felt no hunger. Whenever these disgusting YouTubers say the human body does need to eat. I just I'm really irks me when people promote these starvation and her exit 12. The phonetically day dies isn't there enough ignis orders out there now? Like telling people they should eat more than 1200 calories a day.  Dang, this is what I do. Don't you do it too? But it's not. It's like, come on man. People going to copy us, just wrong. And the only way to get through life is by taking a lot of harmful, drugs to trick the body into not feeling hungry. So yeah, all these diets recommend a shit ton of stimulants like caffeine as well as there's a weight loss drugs and injections. The good news is that most people can't afford these expensive appetite suppressing drugs and injections. The bad news is that people are still going to starve themselves in an attempt to lose weight and this mentality.  Is abundant in The Fad diet in world, but it's the way that some YouTubers promote this obsessive. Self-salvation that really angers me. This is where you define. You're safe.  All the healthy way of doing it is of course eating the right food sleeping on time. Don't crash diet blah blah blah blah blah blah, blah blah, and controlling, what you eat and allowing yourself to eat. Whatever you want. Just in moderation. It is definitely safe. Otherwise, I would not be doing it myself. You're not starving yourself. Now this diet is safe. No, it's fucking not. It's unethical to Sun, but it worked for me. So  You know, it doesn't hurt to share it right in. So you have to be very, very strict on this side. Take a picture of everything. You eat, write down everything, you eat during my bikini competition. I wrote down every chicken, breast every egg white, every scoop of protein powder and what it ate it too. Seriously. We'll keep you in line. You really, really need to do that.

You know, it works me it fucking hurts me because these people don't give a fuck about you. If you didn't even a sort of, they just like it, buy my book sale. I don't know, worries, love and hugs. It's just fucked up. So, the small amount of food that they do recommend.  Is absolute shit.  Please 100 grams.  Is fresh white fish Lobster?  Or shrimp. Half a cup. Of tuna. Three ounces of any meat of your choice. Ice cream, one hard-boiled, egg and half a cup of cottage cheese, eggs, meat and fish. What's meet lots of eggs? Lots of cholesterol. Lots of saturated fat. I mean, I think he's quick fix kind of high-protein diets. You may lose water weight initially, but that's just due to you losing a lot of water out of your muscles. Your muscles, atrophy because muscles are about 80 percent water. So when you stop having  You dehydrate the body, the water is sucked out, the muscles, the muscles start to atrophy and you just kind of shrink like a prune. It's not a lot of fat loss. It's a lot of water loss, which is only temporary high protein diets have been proven by people like dr. T Colin Campbell. It's remote diseases like cancer, osteoporosis. And kidney and liver issues. Animal protein is far too acidic for the human body.  High protein foods are also extremely fiber deficient. I mean, she's she's getting so much animal protein. Does she blah you'd be constipated on that in crab and shrimp for lunch.  Eggs for breakfast and chicken noodle bit less. It's like, this is not healthy carbs for me, either devil cut out those carbs and make this totally guilt free. Okay. So T Colin Campbell has devoted a whole book to the whole low carb bullshit. And dr. Michael Greger has also written a book, exposing the whole Atkins crap. Every cell in our body runs off. Simple sugars, not enough, simple sugars and glucose to the brain or cause you to be extremely emotionally unstable, and very lethargic, Okay, so high fat diets have been associated with all  Diseases, like, heart disease, diabetes and obesity animal products. And refined oils are extremely high in fat and I do not recommend them. If you want sustainable long-term Health, if you want to burn fat, Casey says eat more fans. Don't eat carbohydrates. Carbohydrates, are turned into fat and fat is turned into muscle. According to Casey. Don't eat more fat if you want to get what, but what what the fuck do they call it bats. I see doesn't have a  A clue. These kinds of diets. Also promote Foods really high in cholesterol like eggs and meat and they might get away with it now, but in the long term, they will get heart attacks. Our bodies, make all the cholesterol. We need whatever you say, the optimum amount of dietary cholesterol is 0 so, obviously these calorie restrictive diets are going to lead to severe vitamin and mineral deficiencies. But when you're just eating food that has little to no nutritional benefits whatsoever like animal foods and yeah, you're going to get very ill long-term and the really sad thing is when you look at how  So this bad advice is actually affecting people, especially young girls.  And what do these YouTubers have to say to young girls planning starving themselves? Yes.  How fucking irresponsible, when I look at the comment section of these videos, I see thousands of confused depressed desperate, people who have been brainwashed to believe that losing weight will somehow make them feel happier. And these people will do almost anything to reach that goal. But none of them were ever really get there because no one can sustain these starvation diets and the ones that don't give up.  Although they end up in hospital.  These videos are a core of a Visa T, mental health, and many other diseases. It might sound overdramatic but it is true.  What do I recommend them?  The way I see it. If you're struggling with weight issues, why not choose a lifestyle, where you can eat unlimited quantities of food and feel, happy healthy and energized every single day. Hey fruits and veggies. They are the key to long-term weight loss, Health Fitness and self love, but it's not all about weight loss. And number on the scale is not going to make you happy.  Happiness comes from within.  We need to focus on overall health, both physical, and mental. And that's the reason why I recommend veganism.

One of the worst Parts about keeping their blood sugar and check his constantly having to stick their finger and test their blood now a new painless tester could help diabetics say goodbye to those finger sticks Health editor. Dr. Maria simbra has more on how this newer device works.  New mom Samantha Low Shoulder has Type 1 diabetes. Her pancreas has stopped making insulin a hormone needed for processing sugar. She has to check her blood sugar throughout the day to make sure it's not too high and not too low. Typically this would be done with finger sticks. She would check 15 times a day. That's no fun. Of course. My fingers are calloused because of it. Now all she has to do is look at her phone. If I turn my phone to the side I can get a  Half of my blood sugar's her readings are transmitted wirelessly every five minutes from a sensor. She wears on her skin. It tends to be within 10 to 20 points of my actual blood sugar which to me is fabulous these sensors check a glucose or blood sugar level in the fluid in between the cells. This gives you the same reading as checking a glucose level in the blood stream. These devices have been available over the last five years and they're getting smaller and smaller while it sits on the skin. It has a  a small filament that goes into the skin with an automatic inserter. My husband's been the one who's most of the time been inserting for me an alarm sounds when the sugar is too high and you can give yourself more insulin.  And the alarm sounds when it's too low when it happens in the middle of the night or while driving. It can be a big problem. They recently changed yet where you cannot turn off that urgent low alarm because of course if you are in a situation like that they want to make sure you're hearing the alarms and I'm sure it's a liability thing. Well, your brain has to have glucose if the brain doesn't have glucose to Can't Function commercial insurers have been covering it but Medicare has not  The device itself is about a thousand dollars, but you also need the actual sensors $300 for a three-month Supply. We did have to pay a little out of pocket and we pay monthly to get the sensors but the insurance covers I think 80% of it. And while the sensor is well suited for certain diabetics more people could benefit. I think it's available for almost any patient right now for type 1 diabetes, but what type 2 is also there's no reason you can't do it. Could the skin sensor mean the end of fingers?  Six largely. Yes, so currently the FDA has approved use of the device. But with two finger sticks a day for calibration, you do have to check I would say at least two to four times a day. It is a super reliable device as long as you're willing to calibrate it when I want you to and you may still have other inconveniences in everyday experiences. If I'm going through metal detectors are going through concerts and things like that where it's constantly going off and you have to explain your situation or request a special pat down. None of that was  / enticing to me. I always teach them now finger sticks because you never know when it's a machine. It's not going to work Samantha's favorite part at a glance. She can see which way her blood sugar is trending is a really fabulous tool and I'm very very thankful that it's available to me today. I'm dr. Maria simbra KDKA TV news.\",\n",
       " '53WxEvd7-_w': \"These are my assistants Coleman and Phil, they're both around the same height weight and consequently, they have the same body mass index or BMI. But if you split them, open Damien Hirst style or just compare the results of their body scans. You can see a slight difference. Bill has more body fat than Coleman and Coleman has more muscle than fail. Although BMI is a popular, measure to assess. If a person's weight, might be, putting them at risk for obesity-related diseases. Its results can be  be pretty misleading and less nuanced. Then we'd like. So the BMI is an index that looks at somebody's body weight divided by their height. So the formula is the body weight in kilograms divided by the height and M2, 18.5 and below is underway. 18.5 to 24.9 is your Healthy range. 25 to 29.  Nine is overweight and a BMI over 30 is classified as obese with the idea being that the taller. Somebody is the more they should weigh. Kind of weird, how a single decimal point can separate being overweight from being obese, major problem with using BMI as a marker of Health, when it comes to body weight. Because it penalizes, you, if you have a lot of muscle and you're healthier, let's use. Professional athlete, Marshawn, Lynch.  CH as an example, he's 511 215 pounds and his BMI is 30. He be categorized as obese. That's because BMI doesn't distinguish muscle from fat. We're here. We're really concentrating on how much muscle does somebody have because muscle is the metabolic engine. It's the thing that burns calories. And the more muscle you have, the easier it is for you to stay at a lower more healthy body fat percentage. Not necessarily a BMI.  And this way BMI is reliability as an indicator of Health breaks down for athletes like Lynch. There are several more variables that can influence. The interpretation of BMI things like age, gender and ethnicity, while BMI is a useful measure for a large population study. For example to compare relative obesity rates from state to state it becomes more problematic when you use it to determine an individual's help.  The body mass index was introduced in the early 19th century. This guy who created the formula, I am. So sorry. I'm going to butcher his name, Lumber and all fridge. Accurately wasn't even a physician could play was a Belgian mathematician. His reason for creating a formula was study the normal, man. Not obesity. It's you shifted to study obesity because of, and selkies in 1972 Keys. Use the formula and his indices are relative weight and obesity study.  Name the formula to body mass index. And from there, the new measure, caught on among researchers over the years. It's used in the health, professional field Group and it's pretty much stuck around since it's easy to use cheap fast and it's right about 80% of the time. So even though BMI has stuck around for more than 200 years. It's not the be-all and end-all health indicator. There are more effective ways to assess body composition, and overall health Hydro.  Weighing or underwater weighing is an option along with MRI scans. And using waist to hip ratio, medical tests, like checking blood pressure glucose levels, resting metabolic rate, can further give a clearer picture of overall health. I went to George Washington University and lab director. Todd Miller showed me another way using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry or dexa image. It measures total body composition including fat Mass lean body mass and bone density. So the green  Is the areas where the body is very lean, the yellow are areas of moderate fat and the red are areas of high fat. But this person was here, July 3rd. She had 72 pounds of fat, and 109 pounds of muscle. And in December 27th of this year. She had 37 pounds of fat and 115 pounds of muscle using this chart. You can see if this person stepped on a scale. They only see they lost 29 pounds. What the scale wouldn't say is that.  They gained six pounds of muscle and BMI wouldn't say that either. So even if two people have similar bmis that one number will never, truly give either of them. The full picture of their overall, well-being, BMI is an indirect measurement of one aspect of an individual's health. So while it can be helpful, it shouldn't be the only way to understand the human body.\",\n",
       " '596LMJTJFsk': \"A fourth group of medication is one that we call Fires older Dean diodes.  We just use the word T's Edie's for short in order to pronounce it easily.  There are two agents made in this fashion. They are called avandia or Raza glitter Zone and Actos or pioglitazone.  These agents are a little bit different than anything else in that. They work in the body to reduce insulin resistance. They work on the muscle cells and the fat cells of your body and enable them to use insulin better and therefore reduce your blood sugar very effectively. Avandia comes as a 2 4 or 8 milligram tablet and it's taken once a day or sometimes twice a day.  Actos comes as a fifteen Thirty or forty five milligram tablet and is also taken once a day.  The big thing about these two agents is that they don't cause an excessively low blood sugar. And therefore we don't really need to test our blood sugar as often when we take that medicine in order to identify hypoglycemia because it won't happen.  However, these agents do have some adverse effects. They cause some fluid retention. And therefore if you have heart failure, you should not take these medications. There was a question whether there was an increased incidence of heart attack actually with avandia, but in recent studies that has not been shown to be the case, even though there was an increase incidence of heart attack in patients who had fluid retention and  heart failure  There is one other side effect of these drugs which is of some importance. It has recently been shown that they cause a weakening of the bones or osteoporosis and may lead to fractures but it's a you unusual fracture site. It's the law the bones of the feet or the hands of the lower arms not the spine and the hips the usual source of most osteoporosis fractures. So if you have a person who has osteoporosis, they probably  Shouldn't take these agents.  Finally, I should mention these Agents come combined with metformin and with a sulfonylurea called Amaryl and therefore avandia is available as a Van Dam it and a Van de menthe is a drug combining 500 milligrams of Metformin with 2 4 or 8 milligrams of avandia.  The amount of Metformin in those agents could be either a 500 or a thousand milligrams pill so you can end up taking one pill twice a day and have a very significant blood sugar lowering and it's used to great deal in patients who have a high A1C that is high blood sugars. And you need more than one drug to get them down to their goal level. That's when you would consider a combined agent.  Another combination is a combination of avandia and a sulfonylurea Amaryl or glue glimepiride.  And a van derail comes as a for milligram of avandia with 122 milligrams of Amarillo or four milligrams of avandia with four milligrams of Amarillo.  This combined agent taken twice a day very effectively reduces blood sugar. But in this case can cause hypoglycemia because the sulfonylurea Amaryl does produce hypoglycemia.  They also can cause fluid retention and lead to some fractures in women as well.\",\n",

I want to emphasize that my perspective is coming from one with type 2 and not type 1 diabetes. Our channel is primarily for those with type 2 diabetes and prediabetes.  Today, I want to answer the question. How can I cope with all these changes because of prediabetes after you watch the video today? I invite you to check out the description box for my new ebook. This is one of the most comprehensive diabetes meal planning books. You'll find anywhere it contains diabetes friendly meals and recipes recipes for different goals such as eight hundred two 1800 calories per day meal plan.  It diabetes meal planning tips and tricks. There are also tons of diabetes friendly recipes for everyone now for all people whether they have diabetes pre-diabetes or not healthy emotional adjustment is an important part of having a good quality of life. If you have pre-diabetes, it is even more important to have good diabetes control you have to do so many things every day eat the right kind.  As of food at the right time exercise properly take the right amount of medication at the right time and check your blood glucose or sugar at the right times. That's a lot and to manage it all you'll need a sense of emotional balance in your everyday life adjustment problems are very individual. They can show up in as many ways as there are people with pre-diabetes. However, there are several adjustment problems that show up often in people with diabetes.  These they include denial that they have the disease anxiety about it anger depression feeling guilty feeling overwhelmed and even eating disorders having proud problem of her fur Furfrou.  And having problems relating to family members or other people close to you. Now people with diabetes tend to have these types of problems more often than most other people scientists think that the reasons are partly physical and partly emotional on the physical side having pre-diabetes or diabetes may make your brain and nervous system more prone to having problems on the emotional side having diabetes and prediabetes.  Well knowing you have a long-term chronic disease can put you under a lot of emotional stress and self-management itself can be a stress since it can be a difficult boring and quite often frustrating.  Now this form does not allow me to go into every single problem that you must cope with but one thing that is in common with all the factors. I just listed is stress. Your main coping problem will arise from dealing with all this stuff and all this stuff is causing you stress dealing with stress is an important skill for people with pre-diabetes and diabetes the combination of high stress and pressure.  Diabetes can lead to serious physical problems and learning to deal with them. Well, well that can help you stay healthy. So first of all, I think we need to Define what stress is we think we might know but stress is a reaction to a change or problem many people feel stress as being anxious or tense or even threatened stress can come from a physical change or strain like having an  Injury or illness it can also come from emotions such as being upset or angry or even worried stress is a part of everyone's life stresses can be very small and they can be very large every day. Most people have some small stresses like spilling some water or misplacing your keys at some time. We will all have large stresses like the death of a loved one or the loss of a job even  Good changes, like buying a house or having a baby can cause stress. Now. How does your body react to stress? Well, when you feel stressed your body releases hormones that speed up your heart a tense your muscles and raise your blood pressure and your blood glucose. This is called the fight or flight response in old times this flight or fight response help people to act quickly against a physical threat  For example, if a person encountered a wild animal the stress response helped him to fight it or to run away. Now in modern times most stresses in life are not physical instead emotional stresses are more common. For example feeling misunderstood at work worrying about money or having an argument with a family member. Sometimes the fight or flight response can help you stay focused and alert.  So you can deal with stresses that last a short time like taking an exam or giving a speech but it won't help you deal with most long-term stress has the stress response can cause high blood glucose and high blood pressure in people with diabetes and pre-diabetes. If these high levels last for a long time, they can cause severe damage to your body high stress can also make it hard for you to do things that keep your body healthy.  Z when feeling stressed some people tend to overeat and do not eat at the right times or eat the right things others might stop exercising. They may turn to alcohol or drugs. All of these things can damage your health. So how do you cope with stress? Well, you can never get rid of all the stress in your life, but you can learn to cope with stress in positive ways. You might try these suggestions learn.  Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing yoga or meditation to be able to do these techniques properly and effectively it is best to learn from someone who has experience teaching them ask family and friends for support and accept it when it's offered stay as healthy as possible. It takes some effort to eat right exercise regularly sleep enough take your medications as you should but it is an  Effort well spent neglecting your health will only cause more stress take time to do something.

       " '5KWAgKR9JBE': \"Diabetes. And our goal here today is to try and help clear up some of that confusion because unfortunately, diabetes can be one of these really Grim diagnosis, where, you know, the doctor says that you have it, and then from that point onwards, it can lead to, you know, complex emotions and a confusion about what to put into your body and our goal here today to try and simplify that a little bit so that you can understand a little bit about what is truly causing the problem. The problem for type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes and how that can be.  Handled.  So I'll tell you first a little bit about myself. I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 22. So I was a senior in college. I was going to Stanford University and out of nowhere. I started to feel incredibly thirsty. So I felt very thirsty and I lost all my energy and in a very short period of time, I found myself going to the bathroom every half an hour like clockwork, 17, 18, 19 times a day, and I knew something was terribly wrong with me, but I didn't have the confidence to be able to  Say anything to anyone. So I live like that for a couple of days after a couple of days. I went straight to the Health Center at school and I said, here's my symptoms and they took a look at me and they knew immediately. What the problem was and I said you've been, you have type 1 diabetes. So they took a finger stick of blood glucose went into another room, checked it on a meter and came back in the three minutes that it took to the for them to check it on blood, glucose meter, and come back. I'd fallen asleep. I woke up and I didn't know where I was. So I looked at the ceiling.  Like where am I? How do I get here? Okay. I'm in the doctor's office who brought me here. But what did I get here for? So they took me to the, ER, they admitted me. And I was there for 24 hours and over that 24-hour period, they explained to me that my pancreas, the insulin-producing cells, my pancreas had failed. And as a result of that, I now have type 1 diabetes, which means that I had to inject insulin every single day for the rest of my life. You can imagine as a 22 year old, you know, I'm in the middle of college. I'm just kind of a happy-go-lucky guy and all of a sudden I get this really  Grim diagnosis and it scared me. So, if you rewind the clock, maybe six months backwards, I had been diagnosed with two other autoimmune conditions. The first one was hypothyroidism, which is decreased in thyroid production, for my thyroid gland. And then the second was alopecia universalis, which is why I have no hair. I have no hair. No eyebrows. No, our pit hair. No nose hair, nothing. So first Hashimoto's thyroiditis, sudden then alopecia and then the icing on the cake was type 1, diabetes.  So that point I was very scared. So I didn't know what to do. My doctors basically told me to follow a low carbohydrate diet because that's the one-size-fits-all prescription for people with diabetes.  So I was told to eat foods like you see pictured here, cheese eggs, meat, and under no circumstances was like to eat carbohydrates because the more carbohydrate I ate, the more insulin I would need so it sounds like a pretty reasonable strategy. So I said, okay, fine. And I did my best to try and keep my carbohydrate intake low. And then to gravitate towards more fatty and high protein foods.  So, I did that for the first year and within 365 days. I recognize that things were going even further south than they had already gotten T. I suffered from incredibly low energy.  I became depressed because I didn't have enough energy to go and play sports. I grew up as an athlete. I love playing soccer. I love playing volleyball. Baseball basketball. You name it and I couldn't do it anymore. On top of that. My blood glucose was this is a roller coaster eating this way. Was supposed to make my blood glucose much more manageable, but it did the exact opposite. It made it so that when I checked my blood glucose at any given moment in time, I would see these giant numbers like 284 sometimes. I would see a 55 sometimes, I would see a 400 and I had absolutely no idea.  What was causing this?  So after a year of living this way, I decided I had to make a change. I had to make a big change because this clearly wasn't working. So, I did all this research and I started reading books and watching movies and attending scientific lectures and one thing led to another and I got open to the idea that maybe, if I adopted a plant-based diet, that that might actually change things for the better.  So, I was hesitant at first, because I grew up as a, you know, an athlete, a guy athlete. And we're told from a young age that if you don't eat meat, if you don't drink milk, you don't eat cheese that you're going to become scrawny, and you're not going to become strong and you girls aren't going to like you. And so as a result of that I said, okay fine, you know, like that's that's I like a man. That's what that's how many but then all of a sudden this idea of becoming a plant-based eater came into my mind and I struggled with it for a little while, but I finally decided  That, you know, I'm willing to try anything at this point because clearly I don't feel good.  So I adopted a plant-based diet, a low-fat plant-based Whole Foods diet, which we're going to talk in detail about today and in. So doing the single greatest decision. I ever made in my adult life. Here's what happened to me.  My carbohydrate intake went from about 100, maybe 150 grams per day, all the way up to 600 grams per day within the first month. Now, in the diabetes world. If you tell someone you're eating 600 grams of carbohydrate. They look at you. Like you have four eyes, right? That's more carbohydrate than most people with diabetes will eat on a full week and I was doing that on a daily basis.  And I was expecting that by increasing my carbohydrate intake that much that my insulin use would also go up because like we said earlier the more carbohydrates you eat the more insulin, you're going to need right? Well, this is what happened to my insulin use.  It went down. So I started out using between 40 and 45 units per day and over the course of the first month. It dropped all the way down to 25 24 and hovered in that range. So, in the first three weeks, I'd cut my insulin used by 40%. That's a big deal. When you're living with type 1 diabetes, because if you're supposed to inject insulin every single time you eat a meal.  If you're using less and less and less insulin, and you're pouring in more and more and more carbohydrate, clearly something very interesting is happening.  So at this point, I recognized that this traditional model of carbohydrate metabolism was totally not right. That something was at play here, but I couldn't explain it using words. So at that point, I decided that I wanted to investigate this sort of linear carbohydrate model a bit more, right? Again, the model goes like this, eat less carbohydrate.  Have less blood glucose. Therefore use less insulin. It's pretty straightforward.  So, what I did was I went to I enrolled in PHD programs all around the country, and I decided that I wanted to turn this into my intellectual passion because I wanted to explain this experiment. I wanted to be able to describe what was happening inside my brain inside of my thyroid inside of my pancreas inside of my muscles, but I couldn't do it. Using the words that I wanted to describe it with. So, in this process, I went to UC Berkeley to study nutritional biochemistry for five years and really get to the point of understanding, the molecular level details of what's Happening inside of the human body.  And I went with a real simple question, which is, am I a freak of nature? That's all I wanted to know. It's just a simple question, right? Say what you want to study for a PhD? I say I want to understand if I'm a freak. That's what I want to stand. Right? Am IA freak of nature. In the sense. That is, what's happening inside of my body. Just a one-off scenario or is this something that can actually apply to other people? Does it apply to other people with type one with type two people who don't have diabetes, right? So I was able to study insulin resistance, which we're going to talk.  About in detail today and insulin resistance is the root cause of type 2 diabetes, but it's also an underlying factor in many health conditions, including type one. And in this process, I was able to investigate do a bunch of studies and write a thesis specifically, on the effects of insulin resistance.  So here I am today. 15 years later from that initial diagnosis of 2002.  I've reduced my insulin used by 40%, I eat more than 700 grams of carbohydrate on a daily basis and my A1C values which is a three-month marker of blood glucose. Your average blood glucose is between 5 .6, + 6 .0, and that's right in the target range where I want to keep it.  So I'm going to introduce you to my co-founder Robbie. Robbie also has a very interesting story. He's been diagnosed with type 1, diabetes as well and he's  He's got a great story.  Hey guys, doing can you hear me?  You maybe it's better Fighters. Don't use this microphone because I think this one's still on.  But anyways, okay guys, it's thank you, Erin for happiness together and to see all these people here. This is really wonderful to see people interested in this information. So, my name is Robbie barbero on social media. Some people don't be as mindful diabetic. Robbie. I love the post pictures of what I'm eating and videos on YouTube and just sharing this with as many people as possible. So it's funny. Cyrus and I were actually diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in the same year. It was 2002.  I was diagnosed and my older brother actually has type one as well. So my family is sort of familiar with it and I was complaining to my mom. Mom. Like I'm thirsty all the time. I have to go the bathroom all the time. I think I have diabetes. It's like Steve and she's like, no, I don't be silly. So I was like, okay and my parents were living in Minnesota at the time. And my parents were in Florida, looking at houses. We were going to move there and my mom called me to check in and say, hey, how are things going? I was like, Mom, I couldn't sleep last night. I was  Cramping, I felt terribly. He's like, okay, go upstairs. Use your brother's blood sugar meter and see what's going on. So I measure and I'm like over 450 and my brother right there is like, yep. You have type 1 diabetes, pack your bags. You're going to have to go the hospital for a few days. So we went to the regular doctor and then they do run some tests and then they send you to the hospital. So I stayed in the hospital. Think it was only one or two nights because my family knew what to do and my parents came back and they just told me, don't worry about it. It's just going to be an inconvenience. So  It was, my parents are really great about helping me work through it. So, in the beginning, I was following the standard American diet. Nothing was off-limits. We would eat McDonald's, you know, Twinkies, just normal food. So, you know, when you're in the honeymoon, phase of type one, you usually under control, so I never really was out of whack as far as my diabetes numbers, but I did have other health problems. So I took allergy medication, I have  Claritin-D all the time and I still got sick every year. I had terrible acne as a teenager. It was like, you know, you did everything you go and do microdermabrasion. You did every different pills and all this stuff.\",\n",
       " '5qBJNZeIavI': \"Fact, the concentration of potassium inside the cells is about 150 Milli, equivalents per liter. Whereas outside the cell. It's only about 4.5 million equivalents per liter.  Keep in mind, that these potassium ions carry a charge. So, the difference in concentration, also leads to a difference in charge which establishes an overall electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane, and this is called the internal potassium balance. This balance is maintained by the sodium-potassium pump, which pumps to potassium ions in for every three sodium ions out as well as potassium leak channels and inward rectifier channels that are scattered throughout the membrane.  This concentration gradient is extremely important for setting, the resting membrane potential of excitable cell membranes, which is needed for normal contraction of smooth cardiac and skeletal muscles.  Also though, in addition to this internal potassium balance. There's also an external potassium balance which refers to the potassium. You get externally through the diet every day.  On a daily basis. The amount of potassium that typically gets taken in usually ranges between 50 Milli, equivalents per liter to 150 Milli equivalents per liter, which is way higher than the extracellular potassium concentration of 4.5 million equivalents per liter. So your body has to figure out a way to excrete, most of what it takes in.  This external Balancing Act is largely taken care of by the kidneys. Where excess potassium is secreted into a renal tubule and excreted in the urine.  Also, though a small amount of dietary potassium is also lost via the gastrointestinal tract and the sweat.  So, in order for there to be too little potassium in the blood or hypokalemia, there are two possibilities. The first is an external balance shift, most often caused by an increase in potassium, excretion in the kidneys, which lowers the level of potassium in the blood. And the second is an internal balance shift, where potassium moves into cells from the interstitium in blood.  One potential cause of an internal potassium. Balance shift is Having excess insulin.  This is because after a meal glucose increases in the blood and at the same time, insulin is released which binds the cells and stimulates the uptake of that glucose.  Insulin also increases the activity of the sodium potassium pump, which pulls potassium into cells.  People with type 1, diabetes don't make enough insulin. And so they use exogenous insulin, meaning an injection or infusion of insulin in rare cases. Insulin overdose can cause enough potassium. Uptake into cells is to cause hypokalemia another cause of an internal potassium. Balance shift could be an alkalosis which is when the blood becomes too alkaline. In other words. There's a lower concentration of hydrogen ions, meaning, a higher blood pH.  One way, the body can decrease. Blood pH is by moving hydrogen, ions out of cells. And into the blood to accomplish. This cells. Use a special eye on transporter that exchanges the hydrogen ion for a potassium ion across the cell membrane.  So in order to help compensate for an alkalosis hydrogen ions, leave cells and potassium, ions enter the cells and leave the blood resulting in hypokalemia.  That being said, not all acid-base disturbances, affect potassium levels, for example, in respiratory, alkalosis due to low carbon dioxide levels in the blood potassium levels, aren't typically affected because CO2 is lipid soluble and freely moves out of cells without being exchanged for potassium. Therefore. No, hypokalemia.  Certain catecholamines can also shift potassium out of cells and this is via beta-2 adrenergic, and Alpha adrenergic receptors on cell membranes.  When activated beta-2 adrenergic receptors stimulate the sodium potassium pump, which pulls potassium from the blood into cells. Meanwhile alpha-adrenergic receptors cause a shift of potassium out of cells via calcium-dependent, potassium channels. So that being said, beta-2 adrenergic agonists and Alpha adrenergic, antagonists both cause a shift of potassium into cells in out of the blood.  All right, onto external, potassium balance, shifts resulting in hypokalemia, which has to do with potassium intake, or excretion with regards to intake. Simply not taking enough potassium in can lead to hypokalemia like in the case of anorexia prolonged fasting, or specific types of diets.  Most other cases though have to do with the kidneys in their ability to regulate what stays in the blood and gets excreted into the urine.  The kidney does this by the processes of filtration reabsorption and secretion in the Nephron.  First off potassium's, freely filtered from the blood into the urine at the glomerulus. After that about 67% is reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule and an additional 20% is reabsorbed in the thick ascending limb and that leaves about 13% of the initial amount, right? And at this point the distal tubule and collecting ducts of the Nephron can either reabsorb or secrete potassium depending on what the body needs.  Now, reabsorption in this area is taken care of by the alpha intercalated cells, while secretion is controlled by the principal cells.  Typically, for people on a normal diet, more potassium is secreted than reabsorbed at this stage and it could even be that all of the remaining potassium is secreted out if it's simply not needed.  Now, an important hormone that helps regulate potassium reabsorption or secretion in the kidneys is aldosterone.  Aldosterone increases the number of sodium channels and the number of potassium channels on the Lumen side of the principal cell, as well as sodium. Potassium pumps on the basolateral side of the principal cells.  This allows sodium to move from the to Buell, into the cell and then get pumped into the blood by the sodium-potassium pumps.  As the pumps collectively move more sodium into the blood, under the influence of aldosterone, more potassium gets pumped into the cell, which raises the intracellular potassium concentration.  Having more intracellular potassium and also having more potassium channels, promotes potassium, secretion.  Having said all that in situations where somebody produces too much, all dosterone, like primary hyperaldosteronism. Then, there's more potassium secretion by the principal cells. Meaning more gets excreted and that means less potassium's retained causing hypokalemia.  Other pathological conditions that cause increased aldosterone levels include compensated, heart, failure and cirrhosis.  Commonly used diuretics like Loop Diuretics and thiazide diuretics. Also increase potassium excretion and can lead to hypokalemia.  These diuretics inhibit sodium reabsorption Upstream of the principal cells, which means more sodium's delivered Downstream to the principal cells as a result. More sodium enters. The principal cells in is available for the sodium potassium pump, which pumps that sodium out into the blood and pumps, potassium into the cell, creating a relatively high potassium concentration in the principal cell.  In addition, these diuretics also allow more water to remain in the Lumen, creating a relatively low potassium concentration, in the Lumen taken together, a relatively high potassium concentration in the principal cell and a relatively low potassium concentration, in the Lumen increases, the potassium gradient and causes a lot of potassium to get secreted and excreted in the urine leading to hypokalemia.  Another external balance shift causing hypokalemia is increased. Losses of gastrointestinal, secretions typically due to vomiting and diarrhea.  Now the upper GI tract actually only secretes a small amount of potassium. So direct losses via vomiting are usually minimal, but the loss of stomach acid leads to metabolic alkalosis, which, as we already saw can lead to hypokalemia.  Relative to the upper GI tract, the lower GI tract, secretes more potassium. So more gets directly lost in the feces in cases of chronic diarrhea like from infections inflammatory bowel diseases, as well as laxative abuse.  Finally, a very small amount of potassium is also lost in the sweat, which could be relevant for individuals who exercise a lot in a hot climate.  All right. So there are all these ways to develop hypokalemia. What happens when somebody actually has hypokalemia. Well, remember that the concentrations of potassium inside and outside of cells is really super important for maintaining the resting cell membrane potential and ultimately for allowing a cell to depolarize in a muscle to contract and that includes all muscles skeletal smooth and cardiac muscles.  So, with low potassium in the blood, the membrane potential can hyperpolarize or become more negative. This means that the muscle cells become less reactive to stimuli.  Diminished contractions of smooth muscle can lead to constipation diminished skeletal, muscle contractions can lead to muscle weakness, cramps, and flaccid paralysis, which tends to start in the lower extremities in Ascend upward.  Respiratory muscles can also be affected which leads to respiratory, depression.  Finally hypokalemia can affect cardiac muscle contractions which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias as well as cardiac arrest.  Hypokalemia is diagnosed based on the presence of low levels of potassium. In the blood generally below 3.5 million equivalents per liter.  it's also important to get an electrocardiogram, which typically shows a prolonged QT interval appearance of a you wave and atrial or ventricular, tachyrhythmia has  In patients with severe hypokalemia, the main goal of treatment is to normalize potassium levels. This is done by reducing ongoing potassium losses by treating underlying causes like vomiting and diarrhea and using potassium sparing diuretics if diuretic therapies required as well as replenishing, potassium stores with supplementation.  All right, as a quick recap hypokalemia describes a low concentration of potassium in the blood which can be the result of an internal potassium, balance shift, where potassium moves into the body cells, as well as an external potassium, balance shift, having to do with either low intake or highwomen.\",\n",
       " '5RXRr8PKunk': \"So let's talk about body mass. Index BMI.  This is a term that's often discussed. And so let's first figure out how it's calculated. How do we figure this out? So if you have a little stick person  What you could do is have them step on a scale and you get their weight. So the first thing you need is their weight and then you go on and you ask them if they would mind if you would take their measurement of height and so you get there H or height and a BMI is basically this taking those two numbers and using them in a little equation where you take the weight divided by the height squared.  Very simple, right? So now let me calculate my bmi, but before I do that, I have to tell you one more thing, which is that the weight this is in kilograms kg.  And the height is actually in meters squared. So when I was actually figuring out my own height and weight. I realized the problem and I'll show you what that was. So my weight  is a hundred and sixty pounds and my height is 6 foot 1 inch, which is the same as 73 inches. So I would love to use this easy equation, but I have pounds and inches, I don't have kilograms and meters. So what do I do? Well, what I need to do first is is convert over right so I can say all right. Well one pound one pound equals and this is something you can just look.  Up on the Internet 0.45 four kilograms so far so good and now 1 inch which is pretty small is going to be a small number relative to a meter which is huge. Right and so it's it is it's 0.025 4 meters.  So now I've got my conversions and actually what I can do is I can take these numbers and plug them in here.  To help me easily convert from kilos and meters over 2 pounds and inches make my equation much simpler for me to use so I could say okay. Well now how about weight in pounds and height in inches.  squared and I have to multiply right because I have to multiply by the conversion and so I'll multiply by 0.45 for /  0.025 4 squared and to make it even easier. I can actually take this whole thing plug it into my calculator and it gives me the number 703 so I can say ok. So really what I have here is again weight in pounds divided by height in inches.  Squared x 703 so going back now. I can finally throw in my own numbers, right? I can say okay. So my BMI is 160.  /  73 times  Write that out 70 3 squared times actually.  X 703  So let me erase that just to make it clear. Okay, so this math works out to 21. So my BMI is 21. Wonderful. The next question is well, what does that mean? You know if I have a BMI of 21, is that normal or is that good or how should I feel about that? So if you put a scale out here starting with zero to let's say 30.  And I have 25 here and let's say this is about 18.5.  What Physicians have done is basically divided up the BMI into categories and they said okay. Well if your BMI as an adult is somewhere between zero and 18.5 somewhere in this range.  I'm going to do it in yellow. Then you're underweight. I'm just going to write under.  And if you're between 18.5 and 25, if you're in this range, you're in a very healthy range. And so I'll write a little smiley face for that. And if you're above 25, let's say 25 to 30, then you're in the overweight range.  And finally, if you're above 30, let's say you're out here then you're obese. And so that's where the word obese really comes from. It comes from a category of BMI. And so going back to my BMI. I'm right here at 21 and I'm doing pretty well. But the question might come up in my head. You know, what weight would I be if I was overweight and what weight would I be if I was obese, you know, how many pounds  Runs away am I from being in those categories so I can go back to my equation BMI equals W over H squared and I can just rearrange it I could say. Okay. Well, how about W equals BMI?  times H squared  over 703 right because that's the conversion. So if I rewrite the equation like this then now I can solve for my weight. I can say, okay. Well, let's say that I wanted a figure out what to do if I have a BMI of 25 and I know that my height probably won't change. I'm not going to grow anymore and 703 is the number we always have to use when we're using the conversion from  Pounds 2 kilos and inches to meters. So what does that equal well in this particular case using 25, I can see that for me to be overweight. I would be around a hundred and ninety pounds a hundred and ninety pounds.  So that's actually really really good to know that's actually 30 pounds above what I am today. So that gives me a sense for how far away I am from being overweight and I can even do this for a BMI of 30. I can say what about a BMI of 30?  My current height again is 73 in that's not going to change and I can do the math and find out that in this case. My weight would be 227 pounds.  So if I was 227 pounds given my height I would be considered obese.\",\n",
       " '5SZCajunA-0': \"Soon autoimmune disease is this special sort of disease where your own immune cells have gone Rogue and start to attack your own cells, right? Hepatitis happens to mean, inflammation of the liver. So it's reasonable to say that autoimmune hepatitis. Is this resulting inflammation of your liver tissue because they're being attacked by your own immune cells.  Like many autoimmune diseases, the root cause of autoimmune. Hepatitis is ultimately not super clear. But some researchers think it's a combination of environmental triggers and genetic predisposition.  It tends to occur most often in young women in the female to male ratio is about four. To one, also though, an important piece of the genetic puzzle is the human leukocyte antigen system shortened to HLA, which is this location of genes on chromosome, 6 that regulate our immune functions specifically these genes control, the proteins that are encoded and used on the cells. Surface to present foreign molecules to the immune system, but although they present antigens there. Also,  Form of antigen themselves. They aren't though the same type of antigen as one on an infectious molecule, but actually a low antigens that vary from person to person and are actually specific self proteins.  Usually, our thymus makes sure that the T cells that attack these self proteins aren't allowed to survive in autoimmune disease. There may be some abnormality associated with specific self proteins. That lets the T cells attack them.  Based on studying people with autoimmune hepatitis. They often have HLA DDR3 and ddr4 which are both MHC Class 2 surface receptors the Dr. Part refers to its location on the chromosome. For example, depending on the location. You could have hlaa, hla-b HLA, C, or HLA D, and HLA DS3 sub-regions. P q and R. So this one is HLA Dr.  So specifically with autoimmune hepatitis, there seems to be some sort of connection between these particular self proteins, the HLA Dr. And mounting an attack against your own liver.  Autoimmune. Hepatitis also tends to be associated with other diseases like Hashimoto's thyroiditis where your immune cells attack, your thyroid and Graves disease where your thyroid over produces thyroid hormones.  Clinically autoimmune, hepatitis patients can sit anywhere on a spectrum from completely asymptomatic to cirrhosis and fulminant. Hepatitis also known as acute liver failure or they might be somewhere in between with debilitating symptoms like fever jaundice, and hepatosplenomegaly a condition where both the spleen and the liver are way larger than their normal size. Probably caused by inflammation, due to immune cell attack.  Also, for symptomatic patients, will be this increase in blood transaminases. Usually, there's only a small amount of transaminases in the blood which are these enzymes that help. Metabolize amino acids, alanine aminotransferase or alt is mostly found only in the liver and aspartate aminotransferase or AST is found in both the liver as well as other tissues. So if the liver cells are damaged by immune cells, both, alt and AST start leaking out into the  the blood from the liver, but typically since alt is more associated with the liver, alt will be higher than a St. Even though they both will likely be elevated autoimmune. Hepatitis can be split into two types. Type 1 is the most common accounting for about 80% of autoimmune, hepatitis cases and is characterized by several lab findings. First. We'll look for antibodies to your own nuclei that are floating around in your blood. We also call these anti-nuclear antibodies or anacs.  And these antibodies have failed to be able to tell the difference between self and non-self. And so the end up being against the proteins in the nuclei of your own cells. Also along the same lines. We might find antibodies that are targeting your own smooth muscle, proteins as well. Decreased serum. Albumin is also a marker for autoimmune, hepatitis and damage to the liver. Usually serum. Albumin is produced in the liver. But if the liver becomes damaged serum albumin production, May decrease,  Finally an elevated, or prolonged Prothrombin time, which is the time. It takes your blood to clot is a typical lab finding in more severe cases.  Time to autoimmune. Hepatitis is way less common and is defined by the presence of antibodies to the microsomes of the liver or your kidney, a lkm one or two, a liver cytosol antigen ALC one. This type is most common in young girls and usually happens alongside another autoimmune disease.  As to treatment, initially patients can be given immunosuppressant medications. They may be given corticosteroids which help inhibit the immune responses that are mediated by both B and T cells.  Another drug, azathioprine has a similar immunosuppressant action and inhibits an enzyme that we need to synthesize DNA and so it's strongly inhibit cells, like T cells and B cells that proliferate a lot during an immune response. The patients are resistant to these drug therapies. They might have to undergo a liver transplant.\",\n",

Oh, Tia too much insulin is definitely rather off-putting.  But insulin should only be making deliveries at dinner time. The trigger for beta cells to pump out, insulin is primarily glucose.

The textbook beat his cells are not the only source of insulin in the body. They are by far.  Away, the biggest source, but there are not the only cells with this power.

       " '6B9lnKVX7YY': \"Hi, my name is dr. Troy Giles. I'm a doctor of Chiropractic and a natural internist today. I wanted to talk a little bit about disc Lacey, Mia, or hypoglycemia, or hyperglycemia, either way, but this means abnormal and glice means sugar and emia means in the blood. So abnormal blood sugar's specifically want to talk right now about hypoglycemia or low blood sugar, many times. We have we don't have a good regulation between the pancreas and the liver. The pancreas is in charge of producing and the in the endocrine system. That is the part that's producing the insulin and glucagon and insulin is released when you have a lot of sugar and that Sugar stored in the in the in the cells as fat. When there's low sugar, then glucagon glucose gone is a hormone that's released to pull carbohydrate stores out of the liver to maintain a blood. Sure. This is a good. Good picture right here.  The Blue Line would represent a normal blood sugar level. It's going to raise up slowly and drop slowly. So let's think of you have your lunch and you have a bunch of, you know, a bunch of carved with it pie and all that kind of stuff. And that's the you a 212 about one or two. You're going to start to have the low sugar because you've dropped into the to a lower sugar here. So now you're starting to search for carbohydrates. That's going to bring your blood sugar back up. More insulin is released. Drops it back down up and down up and down.  If you can eat more of a complex carbohydrate diet, that would be whole fruits whole vegetables. That way the body has to digest through those as it digests through the, the complex sales of the of the of the Apple. Let's say you're in a regular Apple. You've got to digest through the meat of the Apple, where the sugars are hidden.  Versus if you drink apple juice straight, that's just straight sugar. So we're trying to do is have you eat more complex means, raw, vegetables, raw fruits, nuts and seeds. Those kind of things are raw. So your body has more more time. It takes more time to digest and extract the sugars out of those Foods. So you're going to have a slower raised and then a slower fall. And right here is where the glucagon would be released to bring the sugars back up, normal? And then you would eat your meal up here.  Versus drop way low and search around for glute for sugars and brings it back up, and down, and back up and down. In order to do this concept where it's smaller. It's lower. It's a slower raises, a sore follows. You need to eat more complex Foods. So, one thing that I do is I go to my, I go to Costco, Costco has got a good price on pretty much everything. I've got raw. Almonds here. I've got mixed nuts here. Now, the mixed nuts. I buy that are salted and  Been cooked or whatever they're roasted. So so you understand this. Actually, let's come in here. So you get this a little bit better.  How to make this here? Here are the mixed nuts. That's what it looks like. The Kirkland brand and you can go to your health food store, go wherever you want, but I just go to Costco because it's got a good price. So I dry. I get the quality fancy mixed nuts that are salted and then I get a bag of of almonds and a bag of Craisins. So you can see here. Well, there's a crazy right there and then here's a blueberry. So I get a body bag.  Craisins and a bag of blueberries. So now I have raw almonds, a bag, one plastic of mixed dried nuts, salted, a bag of craisins in a bag of blueberries and mixing all that together won't fit into a bowl. That's pretty big. I actually dump it into a white into a garbage sack. That's this size. Okay, so I get a garbage sack this size and I dump dump all of my mixture into that clean garbage sack and then I mix it around and then I put into Ziploc bags and  I'll usually fill about two to three Ziploc bags. And then I keep this one that's has a lid on it for eating out of. So I'll eat I'll eat here at the office out of this out of this container or at my house. I have this container is easier to get into. So I'll just pick up a handful and it let's say at 10:00. This is my hand. This would be a handful roughly that much.  I have my breakfast at 6:00, 6:30, 7:00 in the morning and by 10:00 with patience working all day. I'm hungry. So a handful of that gives me. This is all complex. This is all complex because these are dried and end with the protein and the nut the oil of the nut. That's now going to be a good complex bit of snack if you will. So, if we're trying to maintain an appropriate blood sugar, we want to try to eat many many mills, small meals. So,  Could be a meal for me, just that handful. So I'm eating a breakfast, a lunch or a snack at 10:00 lunch at 12:00 snack a two or three dinner at five, maybe even another snack at 8:00, but they're smaller meals. Smaller portions. Roughly the size that Emil would be per propria. That would fit in the size of your two hands cupped together.  Because you're eating a lot because what happens is we eat a whole bunch of food for breakfast, big big meal by the time we've broken through and digested. That is time for lunch again. So now we have a big lunch and we're digesting through that and then it's time for dinner. So our stomach is constantly in digestion, State not breaking through getting through it and getting that food on into the small intestine. It can relax. Now your body can start to relax down.  So that's going to maintain it as well. Slower raises lower Falls, not so much carbohydrate. That's simple. It's more complex. So it's a slower raise and a slower fall that way. There's less insulin needed to store your sugars as fat. And you're actually using more glucagon, which we rarely in our diet has, As Americans very rarely get into glucagon, but when our blood sugar's drop, we should be able to pull carbohydrate stores out of the liver to maintain our  Sugar levels appropriate. So the other the other meaning meal that's really good is two or three chicken chunks. You can take some chicken breast and, and, and fry it Up. Dice it into little chunks. Keep that around in a Ziploc bag and refrigerator. So two or three chicken chunks, maybe 10, almonds, five, or six, baby, carrots again, fits in the about the palm of your hand. That's going to go in and that can be another one of the meals. I'm telling you to eat when you're hungry, but don't eat past.  And fullness generally speaking. Any kind of plate? We eat, we are full. Our stomach is full, before we sense that. We are full. It takes almost 20 minutes for your body, the scent. Oh, okay. I'm full. And by then you filled her clear past clear past where you should be. So it almost is like a washing machine when you fill your washing machine too much.

There's not enough movement to draw the draw, the soap down in through the laundry wash. So you end up, not not washing while your clothes, you fill your stomach, too full. It doesn't digest well with the digestive enzymes, you have mail digestion, and then you get sick and so forth. So it's much less stress on your body, many many meals.

But T6 right here that I have checked. That's what works with the pancreas. So many times, right? In the center of your mid-back. If that's misalign, and you're getting abnormal flow. It's not going to flow out to the organs of the pancreas.  So adjusting. I don't care what you ask me. I don't care what disease, you're dealing with as a chiropractor as a natural internist. The importance of the Neurology of the spine, the brain, and down the spine, to the organs is vital misaligning, the vertebra causes inflammatory States, the nerve Roots, where the nerve exits, the spine, if those are compressed.  With the weight of a nickel that nerver can be diminished and blood flow or electrical flow to the organ diminishes.

       " '6HJfr00CIqM': \"The kidneys filter, blood plasma, removing metabolic wastes toxins from the body and excrete them in the form of urine during this process. They also maintain constant volume and composition of the blood or homeostasis. Blood enters the kidney via the renal artery, which divides two smaller arteries. And finally arterioles the arterioles get into contact with functional units of the kidney called nephrons. This is where blood filtration and urine. Nation, take place. The filtered blood is then collected into a series of larger veins and exits. The kidney through the renal vein. The urine is collected in, collecting ducts and leaves, the kidney via the ureters, each kidney contains over a million nephrons. A nephron is composed of two major parts. A capsule known as glomerular capsule or Bowman's capsule and a long renal tubule renal. Tubules of several Emma Franz connect to a common collecting duct.  There are three steps in the formation of urine. Glomerular, filtration takes place in the Bowman's capsule tubular reabsorption and secretion occur in the renal tubule water. Conservation happens in the collecting duct blood enters, the Bowman's capsule via the afferent arteriole passes through a ball of capillaries called the glomerulus and leaves via the efferent arteriole. The afferent arteriole is significantly larger than the efferent arteriole.  Creating a blood flow with a large Inlet and small Outlet. As a result, the blood hydrostatic pressure in these capillaries is much higher than normal hydrostatic. And osmotic pressure is Drive water and solutes from blood. Plasma, through filtration membrane into the capsular space of nephron the filtration membrane acts, like a sieve allowing only small molecules to pass through these include water inorganic, ions glucose, amino acids, and various.  Dibala Quast such, as urea and creatinine. This fluid is called glomerular, filtrate. The amount of filtrate produced per minute is called glomerular. Filtration rate or GFR. The GFR is kept at a stable value by several feedback mechanisms within the kidneys. This is known as renal. Autoregulation. The GFR is also under sympathetic and hormonal control. GFR control is generally achieved by constriction or dilation of the afferent.  You'll which causes the glomerular blood pressure to fall or rise respectively in a healthy person. The total filtrate volume amounts between 150 and 180 liters a day. However, only about 1% of this is excreted as urine. The rest 99% is reabsorbed back to the blood as the filtrate flows through the long renal tubule. This is possible because the efferent arteriole After exiting, the Bowman's capsule, branches out to form a  network of capillaries known as Peary tubular capillaries, which surround the renal tubule the first part of the renal tubule. The proximal convoluted tubule reabsorbs about two-thirds of the filtrate. In this process water, and solutes are driven through the epithelial cells that line, the tubule into the extracellular space. They are then taken up by the peritubular capillaries. Sodium reabsorption is most important as it creates osmotic pressure.  That dries water and electrical gradient that drives negatively charged ions sodium level inside. The epithelial cells is kept low. Thanks to the sodium-potassium pumps that constantly pump. Sodium ions out into the extracellular space, this creates a concentration gradient that favor sodium diffusion from tubular fluid into the cells. Sodium is absorbed by symport proteins that also bind glucose and some other solutes nearly all glucose and amino.  No acids are reabsorbed back to the blood at this stage about half of nitrogenous wastes. Also reabsorbs back to the bloodstream, the kidneys, reduce the blood levels of metabolic wastes to a safe amount, but do not completely eliminate them. Some of the reabsorption also occurs by the Paris cellular route through tight junctions between the epithelial cells at the same time, tubular secretion where additional wastes drugs and other solutes. Leave the blood  Dream to join the tubular fluid. Also takes place the processes of reabsorption and secretion continue in the nephron loop. The loop of henle and the distal convoluted tubule. However, these parts of the tube. You also have some other important functions. The main function of the loop of henle is to create and maintain an osmolarity gradient in the middle. Le that enables. The collecting ducts to concentrate urine at a later stage. The ascending limb of the loop actively pumps.  Sodium out making the mandala salty. The descending. Limb of the loop is permeable to water, but much less to sodium as the water exits. The tubule by osmosis the filtrate gets more and more concentrated as it reaches the bottom. The ascending limb, on the other hand is permeable to ions, but not water. As a result. The filtrate loses sodium as it goes up and becomes more diluted at the top of the loop. The medulla is an equilibrium with the loop and hence has the same Celine.  Gradient more salt at the bottom.  Reabsorption and secretion in the distal convoluted tubule are under control of various hormones. This is how the kidneys respond to the body's needs and adjust the composition of urine accordingly. The collecting duct receives tubular fluid from several nephrons. The main function of the collecting duct is to concentrate urine and therefore conserve water. This is made possible by the osmolarity gradient generated by the loop of henle as it gets saltier deep in the  Lola. The filtrate loses more and more water as it flows down. The collecting duct. The collecting duct is also under hormonal control. So it can adjust the amount of reabsorbed water accordingly to the body's state of hydration. For example, when the body is dehydrated, more water is reabsorbed back to the blood and the small volume of excreted urine is more concentrated.\",\n",

If at all possible questions that remain can always be sent to the ESRD. Quit mailbox at ESRD. Q IP at CMS Dot hhs.gov.  So now, let's get to the meat of the presentation payment year. 2020 represents the ninth year for the ESRD. Equip the regulations proposed in payment year 2020. Build on earlier, measures and proposed approaches in a wide, variety of ways as we'll discuss. But how does the ESRD equipped fit into cms's? Overall, goal of improving quality via value-based. Purchasing to answer this question. We are going to give you a quick overview before going.  Into the payment year 2020 proposals. As we always think it's a good idea to reinforce the foundation of the program in our presentations.  On slide 4, we summarize how CMS uses the value-based purchasing program to incentivize better care across Healthcare settings, beneficiaries, expect cost-effective quality care and value-based purchasing is a mechanism that CMS uses to assist us in achieving this goal, vbp promotes cms's three-part, aim for Better Health, better care and smarter spending. We like to note that the ESR decrypt was CMS is  To pay for performance program, as opposed to the traditional fee-for-service reimbursement, where rather than paying facility dialysis facilities based on how many services were provided Medicare. Now pays dialysis facilities based on how well those Services help to keep patients, safe and healthy. The ESR. Decrypt uses the government's purchasing power through Medicare to incentivize improvements in treatment of patients with ESRD with the potential payment reduction of up to 2% for  Abilities. That do not meet certain standards. These incentives Drive care throughout the healthcare sector. Not just for Medicare patients.  Slide 5 summarizes the six domains of quality measurement based on the National Quality strategy, the end stage renal disease, quality incentive program for payment proposals for payment year 2020 address five of the Six National Quality strategy. Domains that includes safety patient and family engagement treatment and prevention of chronic disease population and Community Health as well as care coordination.  Now that we've touched on how the ESRD quipped fits into cms's goals, to improve quality. We're going to move onto an overview of the legislative aspects of the program. Slide 7 describes the legislative drivers for the end stage renal disease, quality incentive program, the Medicare improvements for patients and providers act or Mitzvah, which is an amendment to the Social Security Act to mandate. The creation of the ESRD is what provides CMS with the authorization to implement the ESR.  Quit program. The program's intent is to promote patient Health by encouraging renal, dialysis facilities to deliver high quality patient, care, mempa does two important things. First. It provides the mechanism for establishing standards of care. And it also authorizes payment, reductions for facilities, failing to meet these standards.  Slide 8 list of actions that MIT the authorizes member gives CMS the authority to establish standards by which ESRD facilities will be evaluated. The first action is selecting measures. The ESRD quip is required to include measures of anemia management and dialysis adequacy. The secretary May specify that the program measures also cover other important aspects of ESRD care, including patient, satisfaction iron management bone mineral.  And Vascular access.  The second action is establishing Point performance standards that apply to individual measures in addition specifying the performance period for a given payment year is something that many people authorized to CMS to do developing a methodology for assessing total performance of each facility based on performance standards for measures during the performance period. As well as applying an appropriate payment percentage reduction to facilities that do not meet or exceed.  Total performance scores. This payment reduction can range from a half of a percent up to a full two percent payment, reduction information about the facilities performance in the ESRD quip is contained and the performance score report or PSR which is produced annually.  Nipple also authorizes that CMS publicly report results through websites and facility postings on performance score certificates. Dialysis facility, compare or DFC is another CMS program that also provides information about facility performance to the public with the structure of the program in mind. We will now turn to how it evolved from year to year through the rulemaking process.  Slide 9 summarizes the rulemaking process in a series of steps, by issuing, a proposed rule CMS sets out, the clinical and Reporting measures as well as the scoring mechanisms. It wants to include in a payment year. Then the public has a 60-day opportunity to comment on the proposal. In suggest approaches. It would like to see in the program. This is identified as the 60-day comment period in this way.  Facilities and the general public have an opportunity to influence and shape. The rule governing. Each payment year. These comments are taken very seriously by CMS and of led to the postponement of implementing measures until commenters, requests were addressed and those measures have been stronger when implemented in future years due to the input received in this way. It is very important that stakeholders participate in the comment period.  And share their thoughts on how the in stage renal disease, quality incentive program can best serve, the needs of patients with end-stage renal disease.  After the 60-day, comment period is completed. CMS drafts. A final rule, which again dresses, the Public's, comments and publishes a final rule in the Federal Register.  Slide 10 summarizes the scoring of facility performance, which speaks to the CMS preview period. We think it's also important to understand how CMS gathers and use this facility information to calculate performance rate and scores for the ESRD. Quit measures many facilities and other stakeholders often wonder what the reason is for the delay between the performance period where the facility data comes from. And  Impact on payment which is associated with the payment year. The main reason for this delay is the Reliance on Medicare reimbursement claims for a lot of the data that are needed to calculate ESRD total performance scores. As we moved to other data sources. This delay will not be as long and will not be as dependent on claims data. That said the preview period is truly a statutory requirement in facilities will always have an opportunity to review and  Formally inquire about their scores before they are finalized. After the 30-day preview, period, CMS adjust scores, where required for the purposes of developing a final file for the center. For Medicare, after final scores are calculated. They are released and a final performance score report for facilities. And in the performance course, certificate to be posted in facilities for patients to see,  Next, we will move on to discussing proposed revisions specifically for payment, your 2019 associated with the proposed rule for payment year 2020. This portion of our discussion will review the details of the proposed rule itself. We'd like to call your attention to the disclaimer, at the bottom of this screen on, slide 11, which also appears at the beginning of each section that delves into the proposal. It's important to  Note that these elements are not finalized. And so, this material is subject to change a significant amount of change if previous comment periods service, indeed indication. Let me also mention that CMS is interested again in. Obtaining your comments and feedback on any element of the proposed Rule and on the ESRD quip generally, so we encourage to use the comment period and the methods will outline later in this presentation to share your opinions and concerns.  Now, we will take a look at the measures old and new that we propose to use in payment, your 2019.

May greatly reduce the already heavy burden of these toxins in the diabetic patient. These glycotoxins may be the missing link between the increased consumption of animal fat, and meats and the development of type 2 diabetes in the first place.  Since the 2013 meta-analysis was published. This study, came out in which about 17,000 people fall for about a dozen years.

       " '6XEbW-uxsPc': \"Approximately one-third of all diabetes patients, develop kidney or renal damage also known as diabetic nephropathy. Urinary. Proteome analysis is an Innovative method for early detection of this. Chronic kidney disease enabling the identification of first clinical signs. The kidneys are highly developed organs that are very sensitive to any problems. For example, in the case of diabetes and can respond appropriately. They The blood and remove waste that leaves the body in the urine, the kidneys are made up of about a million filters, could glamour Ali and canals call Jubilee.  The process of filtration takes place in the glum merrily about 1500 liters of blood passed through the kidneys per day. While toxins are removed, a large amount of important substances are recaptured by the to Billy.  Eventually, all toxins are discharged in about 1.5 liters of urine. Each day, when renal damage, occurs the filtering process, as well as the reabsorption process become more and more limited diabetes-related, high blood sugar levels cause permanent damage to the filters. In addition, diabetes patients often suffer from high blood pressure. Intensifying the renal damage.  The reduced ability to filter first becomes evident in an increasing amount of important proteins, such as albumin, leaving the body. The detection of proteins in urine is generally the first indication of such renal damage, a decreasing filtration rate. So called GFR is another indicator.  Clinical signs such as pain or discomfort do not occur. With the result that diabetic nephropathy is most often only detected at a very late stage of the disease.  An ongoing decrease in filtration eventually leads to irreversible chronic renal failure. When the kidneys are permanently damaged and no filtration happens transplantation or dialysis required. Otherwise, the body will be poisoned within a few days. Dialysis replaces, the cleaning process of the kidneys and takes place every two days for several hours during this time.  Quality of life is significantly reduced, dialysis replaces kidney function for just several years. As only 15% of the performance of healthy kidneys, can be achieved, kidney transplantation is the only long-term alternative option. Only a few patients can benefit from transplantation as the number of available. Organs is limited. However, the transplants durability is limited.  Urinary. Proteome analysis is the only diagnostic method enabling the detection of early renal damage with high reliability. And before any clinical symptoms occur up to 6,000 proteins can be detected simultaneously using 273 specific protein. Markers allows an extraordinary accuracy in diagnosing, diabetic nephropathy and enables early detection of disease.  At this early stage, diabetes patients, can contribute actively and successfully to manage their disease. And it's complications early therapy can prevent or delay renal damage and allows a life free of afflictions.  Worldwide renowned Physicians recommend the application of urinary proteome analysis. Get your health checked for a longer and healthier life.  Your doctor May recommend dialysis a procedure that removes waste products from your blood. If your kidneys are not functioning properly healthy kidneys filter out waste excess fluid and electrolytes like potassium and sodium from the blood. These waste products exit the body through the urethra in the form of urine.  If you have kidney disease, your kidneys gradually lose function, leading to an accumulation of harmful waste and excess fluid in your body, increased blood pressure, and bone or blood problems.  Dialysis can also be done to treat acute kidney failure which occurs when your kidneys stopped working suddenly or to remove drugs or poisons from your body?  In one type of dialysis called hemodialysis. Your doctor will use a machine called a dialyzer to clean your blood outside your body.  Some weeks or months before you begin hemodialysis. Your doctor will prepare a vascular access site on your body.  Your doctor will create either an arteriovenous graft or an arteriovenous fistula to access your bloodstream.  To begin. He or she will numb the area with local anesthesia.  To construct an arteriovenous graft, your surgeon will make a small incision in your forearm and insert a soft plastic tube called a graft to connect an artery to a vein.  To create an arteriovenous fistula, your surgeon will make a small incision in your skin and connect an artery with a vein to make a larger vessel called a fistula.  Once your vascular access site has healed, your doctor can start hemodialysis to begin your dialysis nurse will insert two needles into your AV fistula or graft. Once the circuit is set up, your blood will flow slowly out of your body and through the dialyzer.  Inside the dialyzer, your blood will encounter filtering fibers and an absorbent cleaning solution called dialysate.  The fibers will remove waste and excess fluids and electrolytes from your blood.  Your cleaned blood will emerge from the dialyzer and continue through the tubing back into your body, through the second needle at your access site.  When your hemodialysis session is complete, the needles and tubing are removed and you can go home.  In another type of dialysis, your doctor will use the membranes lining, your abdomen called the peritoneum to clean your blood without removing it from your body. Before you begin peritoneal, dialysis. You will have an operation to implant, a soft tube called a catheter. Your surgeon will insert the catheter near your belly button, creating a port through which the dialysate will enter and leave your abdomen.  Each peritoneal dialysis session is called an exchange first. You will use your catheter to fill your abdomen with dialysate for a period of time determined by your doctor.  Through the peritoneal membrane, waste products, and extra fluid are continuously drawn out of your blood, into the dialysate, along with the waste materials. It absorbed the dialysate will drain out of your abdomen into a disposable collection bag during your Exchange.\",\n",

I had a patient recently wanted to know what causes hypoglycemia and I want to create a little video on that hypo means low glycemia, which means sugar in the blood when the sugar goes down too. Low, you feel dizzy irritable craving for sweets thirsty, depress all these different symptoms. Okay. So if the sugar goes low, it's not good.  The sugar goes high it's not good. But here's what initially happens you start even in my case start off eating a lot of sugar. So as a child you eat a lot of sugar and you eating large quantities of sugar. Now, if you think about it, when you measure your sugars, it should be like between eighty and a hundred the city a hundred is normal roughly a hundred units of sugar in your blood. What does that mean? It means that equivalent to roughly around 1 teaspoon of sugar per  Enough blood it's not a lot. It's a little tiny bit. So you can imagine if you consume. I don't know a cup of flavored yogurt a glass of juice. That's 38 grams of sugar. That's 38 grams of sugar in one small period consuming them. I mean, I remember myself I had hypoglycemia. I remember going trick-or-treating coming home with a bag this big of candy.  Sitting down and eating the whole thing in one sitting what was I thinking or not thinking it was crazy. I mean talk about a massive Whiplash to that pancreas. That's a trauma situation. My body had to raise insulin so high to get this out and work so hard if you do that a few times in a row, it's going to create a whiplash effect. So it's going to overreact and bring it down and keep it down there too low because I'm creating a kind of a stimulus response.  Bots them just like hitting that thing is going up and it comes right down. So that's an over reaction. That's hypoglycemia other causes hypoglycemia could stem from adrenal stress as well because adrenal gland can create that as well. But also just sugar in general because I'll help people like they don't eat sugar but they have hypoglycemia because the adrenals are stressing out and that's turning your protein into sugar, but that's that happens when you get a bit older, but when you're younger, it's just the sugar so sugar.  Goes into the bloodstream your body can only maintain one teaspoon per gallon. So it has to trigger insulin to pull it out. If you start doing too much it converts to Fat. Okay, and then and basically what happens over time is Hypoglycemia, then turns into hyperglycemia high sugar because this gets exhausted and the other thing is that your body considers.  That much sugar toxic. So it's going to start to repel and block and resist insulin. They called it insulin resistance. So the cells in the liver are going to block it and not accept that sugar and so you might have the high Spike of sugar it from the pancreas, but it won't allow it in the liver. Okay. So now if it won't allow the insulin to be going in the liver and the insulin suppresses sugar and the sugar stays High.  So we have hyperglycemia diabetes. Okay, and that comes from doing too much of this and sometimes then so if you have a comment on YouTube where people make these comments which they have no clue. They'll make a comment like oh eating sugar doesn't cause diabetes. It's all genetic like really just genetic that's you were born with that. This is the makes sense. And also they say you can't ever cure diabetes type 1 because it's all just autoimmune.  Well, what happens over time is that you do this over a period of time you are going to burn this out because even when people are diabetics, they never really cracked the diet. They just take the medication then you burn this out and now you have to take insulin why because this is stop working. That's type one that wasn't created from an autoimmune that was created from Bad diet. Okay. So the point is that what we want to do is we want to  avoid sugar that's the goal and there's the various videos. I have to actually improve the pancreas and the blood sugars and all that. But I just wanted to talk about what causes hypoglycemia in this video. So I will see you in the next one.\",\n",

Seriously did that surprise you did you just think everything was going on everything was fine in your life everyday life, you know just living and you know, I'm a retired police officer. So for the past four and a half  Years. I've just been traveling just taking life easy, you know not watching my diet on my health and and it caught up with you. So how did the program work for you? Basically help me change my eating habits and you know, I know how to eat now and what to eat what to drink and pretty much stay more active which is key in yeah, but sometimes that takes a little extra help what are all the services that the program provides. Yeah that certainly the national diabetes prevention program.  She with a coach who can help you really work your way through find Solutions so that you can make this program real for you. It helps you discover healthy eating tips and increasing your physical activity really importantly helps. You learn how to manage stress and stay motivated in the program. All right. Well it worked for you and I can work for a lot of other people out there. Thank you so much for sharing your story and just remember consult with your doctor about getting your blood sugar tested.

       " '7fuLw031H-g': \"At its most simplistic level, regulation of metabolic pathways inside of the body is really just a fancy word for a balancing act that's occurring in the body. So to illustrate this, I have a seesaw and we've been learning about to metabolic pathways glycolysis, which is the process of breaking down glucose into pyruvate. And gluconeogenesis, which is essentially the opposite in which  We start out with pyruvate and through a little bit of a different route. We end up back at glucose. And when we're talking about the regulation of these particular Pathways were essentially asking ourself when is glycolysis the predominant pathway. And when is gluconeogenesis, the predominant pathway, the body wants to make sure that we either have a net breakdown of glucose. In the case of glycolysis or that, we have a net production of glucose. In the case of gluconeogenesis.  So now the next question is, how does the body accomplish this Balancing Act? And to answer this question, the way I like to think about it is to think about it along a spectrum. There are very fast-acting forms of Regulation that take place on the order of seconds. And there are very very slow forms of Regulation that can take up to two hours or even days to occur. So let's talk about each of these in a little bit more detail. The major.  Principle. That helps me understand. Fast-acting forms of Regulation is a good old principle from General chemistry. Le chatelier's principle. So if you remember Le chatelier's principle talks about anything that's in equilibrium. And it says that if there's any change to this equilibrium, let's say more products are added or reactants are taken away. The equilibrium will adjust to essentially counter that change and return the system back to equilibrium. So what does this mean in the context of metabolic pathways?  Like glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. So let's remind ourselves that in glycolysis. Glucose is converted to pyruvate through several reactions. That are kind of all in equilibrium with one another and so we can essentially think about this metabolic pathway as a series of equilibria. And so imagine, for example, if we had an influx of glucose, let's say we've just seen a big meal and a huge bunch of glucose is entered our body in our bloodstream.  Mmmmm, what will happen to this equilibrium while we can return to Le chatelier's principle and say that, if we have a rise and glucose, it will essentially push this entire equilibria towards the production of pyruvate. And so, you can see that in this example, Le chatelier's principle allows equilibrium to adjust within seconds to just a simple. Influx of glucose to promote glycolysis, Le chatelier's principle. Also applies to gluconeogenesis.  So remember that in gluconeogenesis something unique starts to happen after blood glucose levels have been low for a while. Amino acids begin to break down and form this metabolite called oxaloacetate and remember that oxaloacetate plays its unique role in the conversion of pyruvate back to glucose which occurs in gluconeogenesis. Remember that? It's kind of this intermediary. The pyruvate is converted to oxaloacetate and then  Essentially re-enters the equilibria to form glucose. So you can imagine that if we have an influx of oxaloacetate, the equilibria will be pushed towards the opposite direction. That is towards the production of glucose. Now in addition. I want to briefly mention another form of fast action regulation, which is called, allosteric regulation. So what is allosteric regulation? Recall that all metabolic pathways?  Have unique enzymes that catalyze or facilitate each step of the reactions along the metabolic pathways. So you can imagine that if we have an enzyme here. I'm just drawing a simple structure. It has what's called an active site where it actually binds the substrate of Interest. So, it binds the lips, a glucose molecule here. But in addition, there are also molecules within the cell that we call allosteric regulators. And these by definition bind to a particular  Portion of the enzyme that is not the active site. So let's say we have an allosteric molecule that binds to a separate portion, like right here. Now, this allosteric molecule can have one of two effects. We say that allosteric molecules can be inhibitory, that is by inhibiting enzymes inhibit, the pathway that utilizes those enzymes or these allosteric interactions, can be positive. That is promote the action of enzymes and therefore, promote the overall reaction, which those enzymes are  Involved, so, to put this in context with glycolysis and gluconeogenesis above it turns out that ATP is actually a big allosteric, regulator of one of these two Pathways. So recall that gluconeogenesis requires ATP out, a net amount of ATP to produce glucose. It's an anabolic building up pathway. On the other hand in glycolysis. There is a net release of ATP.  E in the oxidative breakdown of glucose. And so if we have a lot of ATP in the cell, think about, for a moment, which of these two Pathways would be favor. Indeed gluconeogenesis would probably be favored because it requires ATP. On the other hand, if there's a lot of ATP, that's kind of assigned to the cell to say, hey, we don't need to perform as much glycolysis because we already have enough ATP available and it does turn out. That ATP is actually an allosteric.  Her of a couple enzymes in glycolysis and specifically. It's a - allosteric regulator or an inhibitor of these couple enzymes. Essentially. It's putting the brakes on glycolysis and saying we have enough energy and we don't need to produce anymore. On the other hand. It turns out that there is also a molecule, a MP in the body, which is a, basically a sign that the cell has used up. All of its hdb. In other words, ATP has been  Related and turned into a MP which is a sign that the cell is running out of ATP. So if the cell is running out of ATP, the cell probably won't want to be performing energy-requiring processes such as gluconeogenesis. And indeed a MP is a negative allosteric, regulator of one of the enzymes include Co neo genesis. All right, so that kind of finishes up our discussion of fast-acting forms of Regulation. So now let's talk briefly.  About slow-acting forms of Regulation. So these types of Regulation often take advantage of transcriptional changes within the cell. So what do I mean by that? So let's first remind ourselves. What transcription is. The remember that transcription is the process of taking DNA and making an mRNA transcript and then translating this in the cytosol of the cell to a protein product. And when we're talking about proteins often times, we're talking  About enzymes. So I'm just going to go right right that here since it's relevant for our discussion. And so you can imagine for example that this might be very useful. If the organism is in a long-term fasting state. It will want to essentially up regulate the transcription of enzymes that promote something like gluconeogenesis so that it can jump glucose into the blood and notice here that, you know, even visually as its implied here. This process of going from DNA to mRNA to enzymes is going to take much longer than you know, a simple.  Shortly a or allosteric regulation. And so, that's why this process is more of it. Adaptive process that allows the organism to adapt to more of kind of long-term changes that it experiences and its environment. Now, finally, I want to add in one more form of Regulation between fast and slow acting regulation which is called hormonal regulation. So what is hormonal regulation? Well, it's exactly what it sounds like.  Like it's the ability for the body to essentially produce specific hormones, which are simply molecules that travel in the blood to regulate, whether glycolysis or gluconeogenesis is on or off and the two hormones that the body uses to regulate glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. And pretty much, actually, all metabolic. Pathways are insulin.  And another hormone called glucagon. And depending on whether there is more insulin or more glucagon. The body will be more likely to do glycolysis or more likely to do gluconeogenesis. So let's talk about how that decision is made. Now hormones, like insulin and glucagon are usually released by the body, whenever the body deviates from a particular set point. Now, in the case of regulation of metabolism, set point that we're interested in is the blood glucose level.  And if we return back to our analogy here, the Seesaw here this kind of pivot point we can kind of think about as our set point, the blood glucose level. It's a specific amount of glucose that the body wants to have in the blood at all times. Now to get more specific if the blood glucose level rises, it actually stimulates the body to release the hormone insulin. And if the blood glucose levels decrease, it stimulates the body to release the hormone glucagon and  So, with that in mind, take a moment to think about which hormone insulin or glucose gone promotes glycolysis. And which of these two hormones promotes gluconeogenesis. Basically, this is actually a macro application of a chatelier's principle, right? If we have too much blood glucose level. We want to get rid of it. How do we get rid of it? We break it down and so indeed insulin promotes glycolysis. On the other hand. When blood glucose levels are low. We want to return the equilibrium to normal. We want to pump more glucose.  Back into the blood and we know that gluconeogenesis can accomplish that for us. And so glucagon, indeed, promotes gluconeogenesis. Now briefly at the end. I want to talk about why I decided to put hormonal changes between fast and slow acting forms of Regulation. So, to talk about this, we need to understand a little bit how hormones interact with target cells. So, cells in our body have particular receptors that will bind to the hormones that are floating around in the bloodstream.  So once these receptors bind to a particular hormone, whether it be insulin or glucose gone, it actually causes a series of particular reactions to occur inside of the cell to modify often times enzymes that are involved in metabolic pathways. So I'll just abbreviate that with the letter e and these modifying reactions that occur in the cellar. Oftentimes phosphorylation reactions. That is either the gain or the law.  Loss of a phosphate group often times on an enzyme in a metabolic pathway. And so with that in mind, you can appreciate how modification by phosphorylation is a lot faster than starting with a DNA transcript and I'm going to mRNA and then and then translating into enzymes, but it is indeed a bit slower than kind of the S to S Le chatelier's and allosteric. Regulation that can occur in a Cell as well.\",\n",

This organ controls, your sugar levels, and produces a special juice that releases the nutrients from your food to help. Keep you in the best possible shape. The pancreas sits just behind your stomach. An appropriate home.  As one of its jobs is to break down the food, you eat, it aids digestion by producing a special tonic made of water, sodium. Bicarbonate, and digestive enzymes.  Sodium, bicarbonate, neutralizes, the stomach's natural acidity. So these digestive enzymes can perform their jobs, lipase breaks down fatty substances protease splits up proteins and amylase divides carbohydrates to create energy, rich sugars. Most of those nutrients then get absorbed into the bloodstream and go on to enrich the body. While all this is happening, the pancreas works on another critical, task control.  The amount of sugar in your blood, it achieves this with the hormones insulin and glucagon, which are produced in special cells called the islets of langerhans. Having too much or too little sugar can be life-threatening. So the pancreas must stay on constant alert. After a big meal, the blood often becomes flushed with sugar to bring us back to normal. The pancreas releases insulin, which makes the excess sugar move into cells where it's either used as an energy source.  Source or stored for later insulin. Also tells the liver to shut down sugar production. On the other hand, if blood sugar is low the pancreas releases a hormone called glucagon that tells the body cells and liver to release stored sugars back into the bloodstream, the interplay between insulin and glucagon, is what keeps our sugar levels balanced but a faulty pancreas can no longer coach us like this meaning that this healthy balance is destroyed.

       " '8gAO1wfdHnc': \"I was recently coding a scenario where the patient was a twenty-year-old obese, patient and received an error with the BMI code that I selected. The are indicated, the code. I reported was not correct for the patient. A age. I used the adult codes. Why would this be wrong? Is it an error? In our electronic medical record programming?  This was a question that I find actually number of people run into pretty frequently in ICD-10. At least if you want to go head and click the answer sheet that be great. Okay. So the reason that the person probably received this error had nothing to do with the programming in the claim scrubbing or the electronic medical record, which is the question that they had.  You can scroll down a little bit Alicia. What you actually find and ICD-10 is that for body mass? Index when a patient is considered an adult is not until the age of 21. They have to be 21 or older to be considered an adult in icd-10-cm for body mass index. Now that's different than what we've been taught in many other areas. Right? Most of the time we think 18 is an adult. Well, that's true. Except for body mass index for these cases.  And what the ICD-10 manual actually says, is if the patient is between the ages of 2 and 20, you have to use the Pediatric codes for body mass index. Well, the difference between the adult codes and the children codes, the adult codes. You select what range? The patient's body mass. Index is in, for the child codes, you're selecting, what percentage of a growth chart that body mass. Index is in and most of us are going wait.  A minute. What if our physician didn't use a growth chart because this patient is 20 years old. Okay, you can find one because it's the guidelines clearly State. It's based on the growth chart from the CDC or the Centers for Disease Control. So, what we want to do is we want to pull up one of those lengths for age, wait for age files. So you can click open the top one that says black and white or you can open the color one, whatever you prefer. So when we plot the body mass index.  Has often times for those adult patients, right? The ones we think should be adults, 19, 20, year-olds. The providers going to write down what their body mass index is or their height weight ratio, and we can determine the BMI. All you have to do, is look here to see where do they fall? Because these little pink lines. The kind of squiggly ones. You'll notice that top one says 95, the one below. It says 90 the one below it says, 85. Those are the percentiles where they fall in that percentile growth chart. And when you look,  At the body, mass index codes for children, which go up to age 20. You have to know what percentage of the growth chart they fall in. So, in this case, if they had a body mass index of 32, they would be in the 95th in or above the 95th, percentile for height and weight for their age and gender. And that's what you have to know to select the correct codes. Can you go back to my answer sheet for me, Alicia?  So I included an example here and let's talk through this. This is an example and this is actually another one of the questions off of the pre-employment exam that's coming for risk adjustment. This is one that I used to get a lot. When I worked in the risk adjustment hiring of coders environment. This was one that we would give to new coders to see if they understood the difference between the two. So this is a 20 year old morbidly obese, patient, who has a body mass index of 40.  3.2., Well, we do know that we have to have two codes. Hopefully, if you've looked at the guidelines for obesity, you've got a code, the first code for the morbid obesity, the E60 6.01 which does default to morbid obesity due to excess calorie intake and that's straight from the index. And the tabular will verify. That's the correct code. It didn't says, underneath that code used additional code to identify the patient's body mass index. Well, this is a 20 year old. They fall into the children's coats.  We don't know their height. We don't know. Their wait, we don't even know their gender. All we know is their body mass index. We can still code this one. And the reason we can still code this one, if we were to look at those growth charts Again, Alicia go over that very that last growth chart that we pulled up. This patient's body. Mass. Index was 43. Something. Well, the highest level code that we have options for for BMI is 95th, percentile or above.  Well, they there soon as they hit 32 this patients 43. This is just the girls one. Well, if you go look at the boys, you're actually going to find. It's a little higher BMI, but 43 is still well above the 95th percentile. So we're able to know, it doesn't matter, gender. They're going to be in that 95th percentile or higher code.  Which is the if you go back to my answer sheet is the I believe it's a z68 .54. So that's why we can go ahead and use that code. We don't have to know their gender. Everything we need is right there in that answer.  I did want to point out about a number of people ask me. Well for BMI. Can't those ever go first. No, a BMI code body, mass. Index code that z68 should never be your primary or first listed diagnosis code. Those codes are considered supplemental or informational and they're intended to be used as additional codes to further, clarify how severe the Obesity or the overweight issue. Maybe so you shouldn't have those as your primary diagnosis code. So just to wrap up when you're  King a body mass index, remember if the patient is between the ages of 2 and 20, they're considered a child and you have to use the percentile on the growth chart and have access to those CDC growth charts. They're not an adult until they're age 21 where you can actually just pick the BMI range that they fall into.  Very exciting, and it makes perfect sense. Why? This would be on a pre-employment exam.

Every diets, I love that in your bio that you said, that frustrated, you that between the medications and the low-fat low-calorie diets, wasn't the answer. So with that said, how did you go from there in the, you know, the obviously, you had medical training and, you know, and that's your background to where you are now with, you know, believing what we believe. Yeah. It's actually quite an interesting Journey because it, you know, I went through medical school and I went through  Specialist training. And for the first, what? About 7 or 8 years of my practice? I was just treating people. The same as most doctors, right. If weight loss was not something. I thought about really, I didn't deal with it much. I told them to go see somebody to exercise a little more, you know, eat a little less look at the food guide or whatever, national food recommendations, but it really was around.  The mid 2000's that things started to get interesting for me because what happened, of course, was that the Atkins diet was very popular somewhere around the 2000. So a lot of studies got launched just around that time. And these all got published somewhere around, 2006 to 2008. And they started appearing in the New England Journal of Medicine, which is really the top medical journal in the world. And what was really fascinating was that these diets were doing much better?  Then our conventional, you know, recommended diets, right? So the people who did these studies, a lot of them did them with the expectation that these actions dieters would do a lot worse and here, they were doing much better not just in terms of weight loss, but in terms of their entire metabolic profile, so that was when I started to think about Nutrition a lot because here's a kind of very interesting Paradox and as I started to look deeper and deeper into this sort of thing.  Thing. You realize that a lot of these kind of hand-me-down nutritional beliefs. They're really just not true. I mean, from the very, very basics of what we know like, calories in calories out, which is something that we're taught kind of from kindergarten almost, right? It's all about calorie balance and all this kind of stuff. It's just all wrong. It's just fascinating. Absolutely, to me that we could get to this point where we are just, you know,  One of the biggest diseases that is affecting us. The entire premise of treatment is completely Incorrect and that's that's just, you know, that's just unbelievable. That that that that could be the case. It's actually really interesting because if you look back and I think that where we are comes from, you know, it kind of mistaken treatment Paradigm. So we're stuck in this kind of 19th century paradigm.  Where infectious disease was the major kind of in the 20th century night, late, 19th century as all infectious disease. That's what's killing people. So we went through a period where we had these antibiotics and penicillin and great medicines. Right? And so infectious disease, just kind of really got treated very well. So, we've got into this treatment Paradigm of, you know, one disease, one drive, right? And and so we approached these diseases of the 21st century, which is obesity type 2  He's and all its kind of attendant diseases with the same Paradigm. The like, what drug can we give for this? Right? But it's the wrong approach. Yeah, dozens are dietary diseases. And therefore we need to fix our diet and use dietary strategy such as fasting. That we talked about that have been around for like ever and use these strategies to attack the root cause of the problem, which is all dietary instead of saying, oh, here's a new drug for this but you look around and  That's that's all doctors. Talk about, right? Oh, what's the new drug for obesity? Right? I'm like, that's totally the wrong approach, right from the get-go, right? We don't need a surgery for obesity. We don't need drugs for obesity. We need to dye it well, and then with that translates into even, you know, diabetes and thyroid and heart disease, right? I mean, you know, again, of course, there's a time in a place, you know, for a medication, but, you know, again, it's if you don't get to the cause then, you know, what do you really salt?  Not solving anything, right? And actually and that's, you know, that's the whole point of my book. The Obesity code was what's really causing weight gain. I wanted to actually call the book, The etiology of obesity etiology. For those who don't know is a medical term meaning meaning, what's the cause of it? But, you know, it was to Medical, right? So they nixed that title and said, no you can't use it. But that was really the, what my original title was because I really wanted to  Say, what is the cause of obesity? Because if we get that question wrong, then you get everything wrong. Right? And the real problem is that our understanding of what causes obesity right now is too many calories, right? It's all this calorie balance. Could, you know, this calorie Paradigm? And it's crazy because it's you know, the calorie understanding has only been around for 50 or 60 or 70 years, right, you know, two hundred years ago people.  Didn't have bomb calorimeters. Nobody measured the calorie value of foods and nobody had a obesity. Right? And it's not like people were, you know, you look at 1930 1940 America people are not starving of hunger. Right? Not that there was no food. There is plenty of food. There was just no obesity. Right? And that's that's what we really have to know. Or even go go fast for like 1960s. Like, how many people are really dying of hunger in New York City, right? Almost  It's not right. Yeah, there's some soup kitchens and so on but it's not like the widespread famine that you would see in biblical Egypt or something. Right? So that's not something. You know, you can you talk about this whole Thrifty genes and all this sort of stuff as if people are starving in 1960s, United States, right? That didn't happen, right? And yet there were had no obesity. We had to find out what caused it. And and I think that really, we started with the wrong thing with the calories.  A paradigm that it's a caloric and balance rather than a hormonal imbalance. And that's where everything kind of fell off the tracks because now all our strategies are dealing with calories. The calories, aren't the problem. I couldn't agree more. I mean, you know, if you look at the Diabetes Association diet, low fat, low calories, you know, exercise more and matter of fact, replace all your fats with margarine man-made fats. Oh, and use.  Artificial sweeteners. That's the diet that they're still. Yeah, even when they do focus on. Okay, let's get to the diet. Okay, then they get it wrong doc because this, I believe this stuff comes, it gets locked into government, and I always have a saying, that once something gets into government. You almost can never back it up, right? It's like this low-fat low-calorie message is something that if you turn your television on this morning, I promise you. They'll talk about a low calorie low.  That recipe of some sort, you know, every media Outlet still talks about this faulted science, you know, this junk science that where did it come from, but now that it's here, here we are, you know, so you said a key point and I want you to expand on you and I both believe that weight the inability to lose weight or sudden weight. Gain. This is a hormone problem. You know, I always look we know that we can talk about food. We could  talking about diet but more specifically, this is a hormonal problem today, you know, so talk a little bit about that. How did we get here? And what do you mean by hormone problem? Yeah, so it if you want to prove causation, what you need to do is basically give people what you think is the causative agent and see if it causes it, right? And that's what we do all the time. So when we prescribe insulin, so the major player here is insulin when you give insulin  People, people gain weight. That's the bottom line, right? Whether you think the mechanism is that this or that it doesn't matter, but when I prescribe insulin to people people gain weight, when I give and drugs, yeah, such as sulfonylureas which are diabetic medications, which also raise insulin they gain weight. If I deal with the Diabetes by prescribing sumption, something such as metformin, which is a different diabetes drug. That doesn't cause that insulin surge, then they don't gain weight, right? So here you have a  Direct correlation and everybody who's ever taken insulin or any family members and any every doctor already knows this. You give insulin people come back and complain about their 20, 30 pound weight gain look in the reflection is better, but their glucose is better for the doctor goes. Yeah, but look, your glucose looks better. Your blood looks better, but they're going. I'm gaining weight and I still don't have energy. I still don't feel well, absolutely and that's, that's absolutely the wrong thing to do because  cuz,\",\n",
       " '8JDuBDIy4C4': \"Hey guys, what's going on? I want to take the time out and talk about a specific medical topic that's been making headlines. All across the news, this week, who should be diagnosed with high blood pressure, blood pressure, half of all adults, redefining the Danger Zone. Plus, it's a medical issue that affects one in three individuals at least here in the states. That topic is hypertension. Before we start talking about what hypertension is. Let's talk a little basic anatomy. The human body has a human heart. The human heart has two ventricles.  The left ventricle is the strongest ventricle and that part of the heart squeezes and pumps blood to the rest of the body. It does so through blood vessels called arteries arteries, take blood and allow it to travel away from the heart. The way we memorize that in medical school is a away from the heart a for artery. When you measure blood pressure. All you're doing is you're measuring the pressure that's on the arterial walls and there are really three major factors that play a role in this pressure. Number one is cardiac output.  Which is how much blood your heart pumps out with each beat. Number two is blood volume. And number three, is that resistance, your heart has to pump against normally, when you visit a doctor's office or a hospital and you have a health professional measure your blood pressure. You see them use a cuff that cuff has a name. It's called a sphygmomanometer as a mouthful. I understand. So we tend to use the term blood pressure cuff. The way that the blood pressure cuff. Works is by constricting the arteries within your arm and while the doctor or other health professionals, listening at the brachial.  Artery, you hear that first sound of blood rushing through the artery, that's known as the systolic blood pressure, which is measured in millimeters of mercury. And then when that sound disappears, that's known as a diastolic pressure. Sometimes you see the numbers written as a fraction. The top number is the systolic number and the bottom number is a diastolic number. The top number also known as the systolic. Blood pressure is the pressure during maximal, contraction of your heart and a diastolic or bottom number is when your heart is completely relaxed. While it sounds,  Like taking a blood pressure is a fairly simple process. There's a lot that can go wrong. And there's a lot of room for error. The blood pressure cuff is too small. If the blood pressure cuff is used over clothing if the patient hasn't rested for at least 5 minutes, if the arms back or feet are unsupported, if the patients in an emotional state. If the patient is talking, if the patient just had a cigarette, if the patient just drink a cup of coffee or had some alcohol. If the patient is cold, if the patient has a full bladder and really needs to use the bathroom, all those things can throw  Oh off the blood pressure and make it look like your patient has high blood pressure when they really don't. Because there are so many external factors that influence a person's blood pressure. We don't give the diagnosis of hypertension until we have to elevated readings from two separate visits. Let's do a little hypothetical here, you or even your family member is diagnosed with hypertension. What does that mean? What are you at risk for doctors, make a really big deal about hypertension. So let's talk about it. Hypertension damages.  Blood vessels throughout your entire body, starting from your brain, to your eyes, to your lungs, to your heart, to your kidneys, and even to your penis, if you have a penis, that is, normally, I don't like to be the doctor, that's all doom and gloom, but it's really important to say that having hypertension significantly, raises your risk of having a heart attack stroke, heart disease and kidney disease. This is precisely why hypertension is known as the silent killer.  Or because you don't have symptoms until you're ready. Have some serious complications, having your blood pressure. Well controlled decreases. The risk of dying by 25% and it lowers your risk of having a heart attack and Stroke by 30%. Now, you want to treat your hypertension and you're not necessarily keen on. Going the pharmacological approach right away. There are lifestyle changes. You can make in order to lower your blood pressure naturally. In fact, 90% of  Tension is caused by poor diet, lack of exercise and other bad habits. So if you're not exercising, you should be doing moderate-intensity exercise for 30 minutes on most days of the week. Next comes diet. Probably the most important thing that you can do to alter your blood pressure. The DASH diet, which is a specific diet, which I'll link down below is one that's been proven to lower your blood pressure by 11 points, one of the highest success as we've seen for a diet.  The too bad habits that have been proven to elevate. Your blood pressure is heavy, alcohol consumption and smoking. When we say heavy alcohol consumption, what we mean is more than two drinks per day per week for a man and more than one drink per day per week for a woman when we speak about smoking. We're actually talking about smoking any amount. So do not be a smoker and do not be a heavy drinker. If you don't want your blood pressure elevated. Now these lifestyle, modifications to lower your blood pressure work exceptionally well,  To prevent you from getting hypertension in the first place. So I always like to think in terms of prevention rather than cures. So follow these habits live a healthy lifestyle and don't develop high blood pressure. Now, let's get into the numbers of the matter and talk about some of these new guidelines that are making a splash in the headlines, across the news. Before we had these cut-offs where we diagnose people with, either having normal blood pressure, prehypertension, or what? We call the stage 1, hypertension or stage 2.  And now those cut-offs have completely changed. Now a normal blood pressure is less than 120 over 80 and an elevated. Blood pressure is 120 to 129 over 80 and at that point we should recommend healthy lifestyle changes and check it every three to six months stage 1, high blood pressure is now 132 139 over 80 to 89 which used to fall into the prehypertension range. That's the major.  Change Within These new guidelines. Basically, what we do is we plug in some of your statistics into a calculator and what it does. Is it spits out a risk or percentage of you having a heart attack or stroke within the next 10 years. If you have less than ten percent risk, we have to stress the lifestyle changes and again, reassess in three to six months. Now, if your blood pressure is over 140 over 90 that's considered stage to high blood pressure. At this point. We can start to consider a pharmacological approach. In addition to  I'll changes in order to get your blood pressure to the normal values. Now, under these new guidelines, I'll proximately 30 million more people. In the United States will be defined as having hypertension. And while that sounds like a dream for pharmaceutical companies. It's not a party for them just yet. The reason being is that these 30 million people will be defined as having hypertension. But only about 4 million out of those 30 million people will actually need Pharmaceuticals to keep their  High pressure and check, there are a few things. These guidelines do really well, the best research done in the last two decades, proves that controlling blood pressure to a tighter limit of 120 over 80, actually yields better results and allows people to live longer and avoid heart attacks and strokes. Number two. There's a strong emphasis placed on measuring blood pressure in the correct Manner. And number three, they put a great deal of focus on Lifestyle Changes. This is something I preached everywhere.  I go and with every patient I meet it's much better to prevent this problem then to take a pill. Once it's already there in the medical community. We know, we don't treat hypertension. Well, there's a couple reasons for that. Number one, patients. Don't often come in for screenings unless there's already a problem and we don't catch hypertension when we should. And number two is when we actually do catch hypertension and we've tried lifestyle factors and they haven't worked. We prescribe a medicine and oftentimes patients are reluctant to take  Medicines. Here's the thing. If a doctor recommends a medication, I'm not saying you have to take it. What I'm saying is if you tell your doctor, you're going to take it, take it. Because if you don't, you're ultimately, putting yourself at risk. Some people decide to not take a medicine because of its side effects. There are alternatives. You're not suck to taking one medication or these two medications. There are definitely options and you should always talk about your worries with your doctor because the last thing that we want is doctors,  This is for you to have a problem and not have a treated simply because of a miscommunication. High blood pressure is a complex topic and it has major implications for your health. I hope this video was able to demystify a little bit of what the illness is and steps that you can do to not only prevent it but to treat it in case you're already have it. I know I didn't cover everything. There is to know about hypertension with in this video. So, if you have some remaining unanswered questions, leave them down below in the comments so I can respond. Also, if you enjoy this form,  Please let me know because I want to continue making content that you guys enjoy as always stay healthy and happy. See you next Sunday. Why can't I see blood pressure blood pressure? Well blood pressure. It's called a sphygmomanometer sphygmomanometer. Sphygmomanometer. That's the right word. C-can. These Sirens stop today. Like I just don't understand. Is there an emergency everywhere on 42nd Street?  Just leave guys. Come on, high blood pressure. But only about 4 million out of those 30 million. Well, actually need Pharmaceuticals to keep their blood pressure under check.  Under check, let's do it again.\",\n",

       " '8nEmsR68FhA': \"What's up, guys? Jeff cavaliere. Athleanx.com., It's another bodyweight Wednesday video. That means it's time for me to help you get more out of your body weight training. Now. Don't tell me you're not training with your own body weight. I don't care. If you're a huge iron addict. You better. Make sure your carved out, at least a little piece for bodyweight training because there's nothing that can replicate the command of your own body in space. As a matter of fact, we're going to up that Command right here today by including an overlooked element of your training. And that is isometrics. Now, I've talked about isometric, You're on this channel before, but I think people Overlook their importance. They think of isometrics as easy things, right? I'm not Contracting them or I'm not shortening a muscle. I'm not lengthening the muscle. I'm just hanging out. It doesn't have to be that easy. As a matter of fact, where and how you incorporate your isometrics, especially in the body weight training, can make all the difference. So, here's what I'm suggesting take a look here at a standard push-up exercise. Now we've talked about before, how a push-up may not be the most challenging exercise for your chest for somebody that's capable.  Ville of bench pressing and lifting a lot of weight. However, you can make it much harder by inserting. Isometric holds into the normal set that you're doing. So I can decide to pause here after a few regular repetitions in the bottom portion of the rep or the middle portion of the rep or is it demonstrating even on the top portion of a rep? What I'm doing here though is not just hanging out actively engaging as many muscles as I can, to hold this position. So what you might not be able to see here.  Is I'm actually squeezing and dragging my hands together, like this on the floor, to try to engage more activation of my chest and believe me, I can feel it, but I don't just stop there. Then I try to resume my normal repetitions. And if you haven't tried this technique before, you're in for a rude awakening, because you may not be able to get that many more regular repetitions. But remember, who cares? Because we're not counting. All we're doing is measuring the utter and the ultimate effect that this will have on you and your body in this set.  Taking it to failure, taking it Beyond failure, making sure you get enough out of it. And the same thing here applies to other exercises. I can go up on a pull-up bar, which is already a difficult exercise for some. But for those that don't find it difficult enough and that don't have access to any weight to put on their body for for an overload. Try, the isometric holds intermittently, again, try them in the bottom. Try them at the top. Try them in the Middle where ever, you try them. Try to then, resume normal reps after it. And like I said,  A much different effect, it will dramatically shorten the length of your set. If you're used to doing rep after rep after rep, but with the ultimate goal of getting you more from that set, we can even take it to the extreme with a more difficult exercise, a handstand. Push-up. And again, look what happens even here. I'm still doing the same idea of pulling my hands together when I'm in the low isometric. Hold. But, on top of that, you can even see muscles in my back. That wouldn't necessarily have a  Is to activate become activated because their role as stabilizers becomes that much more important when I slow down the rep. So, when I get it in here and I actually want to stop and hold. Now, all of a sudden, their job becomes that much more imperative to kick in and allow me to maintain my stabilization in this position. It's not easy, but guess what? The ultimate effect on my entire back and my shoulder girdle is enhanced and finally, we're going to actually hit our ABS here in a new exercise to sort of wrap up this whole video and also,  Drive home this concept. It's a modified else. It really just a suspended sit. But here's the cool part is difficult enough to hold an else. It is still difficult to hold this sort of bent knee sit, but it's even more difficult to hold it in either position the bottom or the top. And we're going to do just that we're going to provide our body with this elevated hip tuck. That's the dynamic portion. But at any point in time, we got to be able to stop and hold it and maintain our 45 second hold then.  Come. And what do we do? We resume the Reps. You're not going to be able to go for that much longer. But as I said earlier, it doesn't matter. How long you last. What matters is, how much you make it count? That's what makes muscles grow. That's what makes all the difference when you're trying to get more from your bodyweight training. If you found this video helpful, guys, make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below.

       " '8ZujKJYrEJY': \"Hi this dr. Taryn P Lupo. And today we're going to talk about polycystic ovary syndrome or PCOS.  Let's talk about polycystic ovary syndrome to understand it. You first have to understand how ovaries are normally supposed to work. What happens is. As you develop eggs, they actually come to the surface of the ovary via assist. So multiple cysts will develop at one time inside an ovary.  The dominant cyst or the one that grows the most will actually be the one to pop and release an egg all the rest of the cyst that develop kind of shrink back down and get reabsorbed into the ovary during polycystic. Ovary syndrome. Something goes wrong, those cysts that are supposed to get reabsorbed. Don't, although they don't release eggs. They still form all over the ovaries and you get multiple cysts, these cysts then.  On to produce extra hormones, that shouldn't be there. And this causes most of the symptomatology of polycystic ovary syndrome. The ultimate reason, this happens is actually kind of surprising. It's a sugar regulation problem, people who are insulin resistant or have insulin surges develop PCOS.  Insulin resistance is kind of a fancy way of saying you're pre-diabetic, or you're about to develop diabetes. You can no longer regulate blood sugar correctly. Most insulin resistance happens due to a lifetime of a bad diet things like eating too much meat, fat oils and especially refined carbohydrates can set this in motion. The insulin resistance actually.  Wreaks havoc on your hormonal system, especially an enzyme called 1720 lyase. This will promote testosterone production where you shouldn't really me making it. This rise of testosterone is a problem. But what also happens, there are the cells on the ovaries, the thecal cells. They also produce too much estrogen to  This causes a weird mix of symptoms that present in PCOS patients. Sometimes they'll end up growing hair where they're not supposed to grow hair or they'll get adult cystic acne. The other issues is they have real problems with carrying a baby. Infertility is the main reason PCOS is such a problem. Insulin resistance is the ultimate cause of all these problems, not only that, but the surges in insulin and  Oster own. Create a vicious negative feedback loop and will perpetuate the insulin resistance. It also causes thyroid problems. Later on, you can develop autoimmune, thyroid problems with this condition. One of the sad things is some women. Spend fortunes trying to get pregnant and carry a baby and never have PCOS actually regulated or managed. This is the main reason women.  Have infertility problems and they can't carry a child. Ultimately. It's because of their diet. PCOS is really affected by insulin surges and you'll kind of see two presentations with this. You'll see people who are insulin resistant and you'll see the other side of the coin, people who are hypoglycemic and a good way to tell the difference is usually look at the body. Most of the people who are insulin resistant have very stubborn. Wait, they can't get rid of  On the other side of the coin, you'll see hypoglycemics who are usually skinny PCOS has and often misdiagnosed.  Also one last thing about PCOS, a lot of women get problems with their menstrual cycle. So they either have irregular periods, very long painful periods, or they don't even have periods at all when they get stressed out. So there are natural ways to manage this. This is really about controlling insulin resistance. You want to use the same diet a diabetic with use in order to reduce your acne.  Your facial hair, your infertility, and your menstrual problems. If you adopt that kind of diet, where you reduce your meat or oil especially your refined sugars. You'll see a vast Improvement.  Ultimately, a plant-based diet is going to be the best direction to go for this condition.  So just stay on top of your diet. If you want to manage your PCOS. Also, if you found this video useful, please give it a thumbs up and share it out. I always appreciate that, stick around, and check out my next story on joint pain.

       " '910K7B_1b6I': \"Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar level is one of the commonly found conditions in people with diabetes.  Hypoglycemia can be defined as blood sugar level below 70 mg / DL it can occur in any person with diabetes who is on insulin our blood sugar lowering medications.  Let's look at some common causes of hypoglycemia.  Excess insulin dose or medication is one of the most common causes for hypoglycemia not eating enough or not eating at proper time skipping or delaying meals not eating enough after consuming alcohol or some other reasons unplanned or excessive exercise may also lead to hypoglycemia.  Now what are the symptoms of hypoglycemia, according to the type of hypoglycemia? The symptoms can change mild hypoglycemia, give symptoms like headache shaking pounding heartbeat sweating tiredness dizziness blurred vision drowsiness or tingling sensation around mouth or lips mild. Hypoglycemia can be managed easily.  Madras hypoglycemia, give symptoms like personality change irritability confusion poor coordination difficulties in concentrating or slurred speech.  This type of hypoglycemia can be managed, but it requires immediate attention.  The third type severe hypoglycemia leads to Coma or seizures.  Severe hypoglycemia requires emergency treatment the patient needs to be hospitalized for the management of severe hypoglycemia.  Know how to detect hypoglycemia. It is very simple based on symptoms and by checking your blood sugar level immediately after symptoms will give you an idea whether you're suffering from hypoglycemia.  The other indication of hypoglycemia is when blood sugar level is increased the symptoms disappear.  How to treat hypoglycemia remember early recognition and appropriate treatment is the key to manage and treat hyperglycemia. The rule of 15 is a very helpful way to remember the treatment.  Rudolph 15 says you have to eat 15 grams of fast-acting carbohydrates after the episode of hypoglycemia, 15 grams of carbohydrates may include 15 grams of glucose powder or powdered sugar 1 tablespoon of honey, or Jam half a glass of fruit juice or soft drink.  You can have one of the above options immediately after the episode of hypoglycemia. Then you have to wait for 15 minutes and re-check your blood sugar level.  If the blood sugar level is above 70, you're supposed to have a light snack to prevent further episodes of hypoglycemia. If blood sugar level is below 70, then you have to repeat 15 grams of carbs and wait for another 15 minutes.  You have to re-check your blood sugar to ensure whether your blood sugar level is above 70 the treatment of hypoglycemia should always be followed by some investigation as to why the hypoglycemia or occurred and what could be done to prevent its further occurrence.

It's critical. It's like buying a new device and you need to have some instructions. Otherwise, you're flying in the dark. So getting diabetes self-management education and support is at the heart of good care. So how do you go about working with patients? So my goal with patients is to meet them where they are.

I worked in the LHS treating diabetic patients with blocked arteries in private practice. I found it a specialist Vein Clinic for the treatment of leg vein problems. Now, I have brought together a group of Specialists to treat metabolic disease in particular, the problems associated with the metabolic syndrome. So why and why now? Well, despite being a medically trained doctor until 2013. I too was suffering from the metabolic syndrome. I just didn't know it at the time. What I did know was that I struggled with my weight. I had borderline high blood pressure actually, quite High by today's recommended standards and my cholesterol was high.  This was all despite having followed, the standard advice of eating a healthy diet based on whole grains. I ate five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. I didn't smoke. I exercised regularly and I limited the amount of fat and red meat that I ate, I didn't know, at the time, but I was still metabolically sick. I had the metabolic syndrome.  Here's a video of me from mid-2012 talking on the subject to foam sclerotherapy. Recently. I heard something that rather surprised. I looked at this last week with my family and we were all shocked. I was hardly recognizable. I certainly ticked all the boxes for metabolic syndrome. The tests for insulin resistance weren't available to me then, but I'm sure that if I had  The right test, then I would have found fatty liver and insulin resistance.  Based on my own experience of understanding more about this condition, how it can be recognized and how it can be treated and based on my own personal Journey from the metabolic syndrome to metabolic health. I founded the metabolic Clinic with the aim of offering, the latest diagnostic tests. And interventions. I see many apparently healthy people with leg vein problems, who are metabolically ill with weight problems.  Abnormal blood lipids and high blood pressure. I am sure that with appropriate help. Many of these people could reverse their metabolic problems. My motivation in founding the Mulberry metabolic Clinic is to empower patients with the knowledge. They need to improve their health and avoid illness. If you would like a fact sheet on metabolic syndrome, how you can reverse it contact us via the website or send us an email. I have improved my  my health without prescription medications and I believe that others can do so, too.\",\n",

And how much do we actually need to drink to stay healthy?  The H2O in our bodies works to cushion and lubricate joints, regulate temperature, and to nourish the brain and spinal cord.  Water isn't only in our blood, an adult's brain and heart are almost three-quarters water. That's roughly equivalent to the amount of moisture in a banana lungs are more similar to an Apple at 83 percent and even seemingly dry. Human bones are 31 percent water. If we are essentially made of water and surrounded by water. Why do we still need to drink so much? Well, each day we lose two to three liters.  Our sweat urine and bowel movements.

How do you take care? Took? The gluten-free options. Still has cheese. I think I actually prefer eating on the diet and eating whatever. This is. It's the end of the day today. All I have is leftovers from three different meals, but into a pot and it does not look good. I even had a dream last night that I found really delicious chocolate chip cookies, and then I woke up and it wasn't real. It's 7 p.m. On Friday.  And I'm finally leaving the office and meeting have been today. Where I got so frustrated. I almost started to cry. I really have to figure it out. A like, relaxation techniques and be like, are my hormones? Just crazy. I just got off the phone with Michelle and we reviewed her adrenal test. So I wanted to see what her cortisol levels were doing throughout the day. They were actually pretty elevated consistently throughout the day. This could be a reason why her blood sugar is not coming down for all last week. I was really good. I see.  Super healthy. So, yes, I decided to have a bit of a cheat day, which turned into a huge sheet day. I went to the LA County Fair. I had an icy Bloomin Onion jumbo corn dog, BBQ brisket with french fries, top it off. I had couple covered ice cream. I'm a like, I normally do take my blood sugar 132 that's not really high. So the last few weeks has been a struggle. Especially last week. I was super stressed. I'm sure that raise my blood sugar levels and night. I ate my feelings and had a large pizza with cheese. It came to the point where  Where my thought process was like these things that I'm eating actually gonna affect my number at the end of this. Like, I don't know. I want hard ate a lot of food. That shouldn't have. I'm just pissed. I shouldn't have done it the same time. It's like I wish I could have just done it. I wish I could have done it guilt free, not having to worry about what my blood sugars are now having to worry about feeling like shit. I'm exhausted tired, lethargic the point of passing out. I'm just disappointed in myself. I think, for just giving in to Temptation eating all this food that I shouldn't have eaten. I'm in such a bad mood.  I haven't wanted to do anything then diets, mostly fine. But I'm so hungry all the time. I don't know if it's cause of the diet or just because I'm a grumpy bad person. I also feel really scared that after all, this they're going to test, my blood sugar is going to be the same. I know what you're all thinking. How could I eat the same thing day in and day out? You seen it? I've cheated but I just can't help it guys. I love me some brussels sprouts. So I've always struggled with portion control. What's been really?  Really helping me for this is Sarah gave us a chart, any plate of food that I get. I supposed to save half of that for vegetables and that quarter as protein and the other quarter as that and carbs. And that's been really simple for me to remember and keep track of Sarah suggested. I find activities that reduce stress, that I have a knitting project that's been sitting in a drawer. So I have picked it back up. By the time, we finish the diet. I'll be done. The show, just came back from a week of vacation in Puerto Rico.  It was super fun. But I eat so badly. I had a lot of drinks and that drinks had a lot of sugar. I basically didn't do any of my diet because the A1C is an average of the last three months. I hope when week doesn't just destroy the whole thing. Today. Is Monday and my 40th birthday is on Saturday. There's going to be a lot of cheating the sweet because I'm only turning 40. Once while I'm on a diet. I just tried going to the gym because yesterday I hurt my ankle. It's a little swollen but  But I figured I could maybe just bike on it. On my doctor's appointment tomorrow. See what she says. I hope it's nothing serious. My friend ended up taking me to dinner for my birthday. They ordered a bunch of cheese and olives and bread. So I tasted like, one tiny piece of cheese. They ordered molten chocolate cake for dessert that we all shared is like, the most amazing thing. I've tasted in a long time, but I ate like four bites of it. So I feel like I'm practicing what my life will be, like, post this video.  So it's morning to get my blood work done for the A1C. I've tried to eat healthier and been working out. So I'm hoping that that makes up for the few weeks of patchiness. So we just got my results back. And mine is 5.4. Super excited and I can't wait to talk to The dietitian about it. I got a call from my doctor's office today. They have my test results and my heart sank immediately like oh it's going to be bad and they were like, yeah, your B12 is a little low and I was like, but what?  Out my 81 C and they were like, oh, that's 5.2. That's fine. 5.2. It dropped from 5.7. I had a cane and BuzzFeed such a debt of gratitude because I was freaking out that I was going to be diabetic. You've got my blood work test, results back and I'm no longer diabetic. He went from a 7.62 5.3. I'm shaking a bit. I'm trying not to cry because of this is just something that I just really wanted to find kick. Obviously. I'm still not out of the clear.  I mean, it could never again come back if my diet change, but knowing that, I'm no longer have to take my meds. It's relieved. Change doesn't have to be all or nothing. None of the people that went through this program. Did this 100% there were times where they struggle, there were times where they were traveling, and it was about how do you get back up after you fall down? Go for small changes celebrate your wins. Know that little things you do, add up to have a bigger impact, the way you eat your lifestyle. It's also important nutrition rules nutrition way.  Winds. And yeah, hell yeah, so the diet over and somebody gave me some candy to celebrate my birthday and I can eat it now, but it's going right? In the crash. Sorry friend.\",\n",

       " '_A6GbgUnEZc': \"With pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms neuroendocrine, refers to pancreatic cells, which release hormones in response, to signals from nerves and neoplasm refers to a cancer.  So pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm is a cancer of the neuroendocrine cells that are within the pancreas.  They can also be called pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors or just pan nets for short. In addition to Endocrine cells. The pancreas also has exocrine cells which make up a majority of the gland. Most pancreatic cancers arise from exocrine cells and they're called adenocarcinomas. Whereas only a minority arise from pan and ETS.  Now, the pancreas is a long skinny gland about the length of a dollar bill, which sits to the left of the duodenum in behind the stomach, in the upper abdomen or the epigastric region. It plays two main roles. There's the exocrine part of the pancreas which has acinar cells that make digestive enzymes that are secreted into the duodenum to help digest food. There's also the endocrine part of the pancreas which has a few different types of islet cells or neuroendocrine cells. Each of which  Make different hormones. These neuroendocrine cells are present in clusters or islands called islets of langerhans.  The largest group of cells are the beta cells. Which secrete insulin insulin mainly lowers the blood glucose levels by transporting glucose into the cells and also pushes potassium into the cells, which decreases potassium in the blood.  Another group are the alpha cells which secrete glucagon it raises, the blood glucose levels by getting the liver to generate glucose from amino acids and lipids and to break down glycogen into glucose.  They're also Delta cells, which secrete somatostatin, which decreases the release of other hormones, including insulin glucagon and serotonin.  There are also gamma cells also called pancreatic polypeptide cells, which secrete, pancreatic polypeptide and stimulates the release of digestive enzymes from the stomach and small intestine as well as slow down intestinal movement.  Finally, there are a few rare types of cells called in Tarot chromaffin cells as well as D1 cells in G cells which are scattered in the islets of langerhans.  And Taro chromaffin cells secrete serotonin, which helps with motility of the gastrointestinal tract, D1 cells, release a hormone, vasoactive intestinal peptide or VIP, which relaxes the small intestine and stimulates the release of intestinal digestive enzymes, but inhibits hydrochloric acid release from the stomach g cells are found in the pancreas and stomach and they secrete gastrin.  Gastrin stimulates, the parietal cells of the stomach mucosa to secrete hydrochloric acid and also stimulates the glands in the epithelial layer.  In pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms one of the many types of neuroendocrine cells. Mutates and starts dividing uncontrollably, forming a tumor over time. Sometimes the mutation is in a tumor suppressor Gene like Pete, een, and men1 tumor suppressor genes usually regulate cell growth. So when they mutate, the result is uncontrolled cell growth. Mutation of the men1 gene results in an inherited condition known as multiple endocrine neoplasia.  Or I'm Iain type one where adenoma is or malignant tumors forming the parathyroid gland pituitary gland and pancreas some pan and ETS are benign tumors, which means that they don't invade nearby tissues. Whereas others are malignant tumors mean that they do invade surrounding tissues and even metastasize or spread through the lymph to distant ones.  Pan, any tees are classified into functional tumors, which secrete hormones and non-functional tumors, which don't secrete any hormones.  Non-functional pan and ETS are more common, and they're usually asymptomatic until they grow to a large size and metastasize to other organs like the liver.  Large tumors can compress surrounding structures. For example, a tumor might compress the common bile duct leading to a backup of bile and causing obstructive jaundice, which is when the skin turns yellow from the build-up of bilirubin in the tissues.  Functional pancreatic neuroendocrine. Tumors are less common and depend on the type of cell they arise. From in the hormone. They produce.  The most common functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor is an insulinoma, which arises from beta cells. That make insulin, insulin. Oma's are usually benign solitary tumors that cause hypoglycemia or low blood glucose. And in severe cases can lead to confusion and loss of consciousness.  The second most common type is a gastro Noma that arises from the G cells that make gastrin gastronome has secrete large amounts of gastrin, which produces a syndrome called zollinger-ellison syndrome.  Access hydrochloric acid, erodes the mucosa, which result in peptic, ulcers, a unique feature of zollinger-ellison syndrome. Is that the peptic ulcers are formed? Not only in the stomach and the duodenum, but there's so much acid that ulcers are formed in more distant parts of the small intestine like the jejunum  The acid also inactivates the pancreatic digestive enzymes, which allows food especially fat to pass right through the intestines. Undigested leading to greasy and smelly stools called steatorrhea.  The third most common type of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors is a vasoactive intestinal peptide Oma, which arises from the D1 cells that make, vasoactive intestinal peptide, basil, active, intestinal polypeptide Oma's or VIP Oma's. Resulting. Wdh A syndrome where w d stands for watery diarrhea, which is due to increased fluid, secretion by the small and large intestine, H stands for hypokalemia, or low potassium levels in the blood due to potassium losses in the intestinal fluid.  And a stands for a claw or Hydra the absence of hydrochloric acid. Secretion.  The fourth type is glucagon Oma which arises from the alpha cells that make glucagon, access glucagon, leads to increased blood glucose resulting in diabetes mellitus.  Glucagon Oma's also result in a loss of lipids and proteins that are used to form glucose and they typically, cause a neck, roll, it admira Tory erythema, which is a red blistering rash, that mostly affects the mouth and limbs.  The fifth type is somatostatin Oma which arises from the Delta cells, which secrete, somatostatin, the excess somatostatin inhibits release of other pancreatic hormones, like insulin, gastrin and VIP, which leads to diabetes mellitus steatorrhea and hypochlorite Hydra or decrease hydrochloric acid secretion.  Finally, there are also pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors that develop from pancreatic polypeptide cells and entero chromaffin cells, but these ones are very rare.  Diagnosis of functional. Pancreatic neuroendocrine. Tumors is based on measuring, pancreatic hormone levels. Non-functional. Tumors are usually hard to detect since no increased hormone levels can be found in the blood in addition MRI or CT Imaging of the pancreas can help identify a tumor in estimated size.  The treatment for a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor depends on the type and size when dealing with a functional tumor, with the exception of somatostatin, Nomas somatostatin like medications are given to reduce hormone production. In addition gastronome has can be treated with medications that block gastric acid secretion when dealing with non-functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors large tumors that cause compression can be managed with surgery.  Alright, it's a quick recap angry. Attic, neuroendocrine neoplasms or a pan and ETS are tumors of hormone producing cells of the pancreas, and their symptoms depend on their size and cellular origin. And any T's can be non-functional. Tumors. Meaning they don't produce any hormones or they can be functional, tumors. Meaning they do produce hormones.  The most common types of functional tumors include insulinoma. Has that make insulin gastronome has that make gastrin glucagon Oma's, which make glucagon VIP Oma's that make vasoactive intestinal peptide and somatostatin Nomas that make somatostatin.  Hey guys.

If you are worried that your body isn't properly, breaking down glucose or producing enough, insulin. It is a simple test. That can provide important answers. If your health is being impacted table of contents. What is a glucose tolerance test? Why is it done how to prepare for the  Test glucose tolerance, test procedure, oral test Point, diction, test side, effects results, glucose tolerance test for gestational diabetes. What is a glucose tolerance test? The glucose tolerance, test is means to determine how well your body is able to break down sugar. It consists of taking the measurement of your blood injecting or consuming the certain amount of glucose, and then measuring the glucose levels in your blood.  Link that intake of sugar. Depending on the concentration of the glucose in your blood. It is possible to determine whether your body is functioning properly. In terms of glucose. Breakdown. Why is it done? The main reason why this test is administered is to determine whether you are suffering from type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes. If you think that you are experiencing some of the symptoms of diabetes, your doctor will almost certainly  I recommend that you take one of these very common tests, in the case of type 1 diabetes. It is easier to recognize and diagnose. But if you are developing type 2 diabetes, the symptoms may be more difficult to properly identify. Most pregnant women should undergo this test due to the high risk of gestational diabetes and the test will typically be administered around the 24th week of pregnancy. If the signs of  Gestational diabetes have appeared before then your doctor May give you the test earlier in your term. How to prepare for the test before you undergo? A glucose tolerance test. Most doctors will recommend an 8-hour fast without any food or beverages aside from water in the days, leading up to the vast. However, it is best to eat a normal diet avoid urinating before the test.  As a urine, sample may be required and be sure to inform your doctor of any medication. You may be taking things like beta blockers and a depressant or steroids, among others can skew the results of the test. So be as upfront and honest with your doctor as possible glucose tolerance test procedure. There are a few different types of tests, including an oral test and and injection test.  World test. This is by far the most common form of this test. The sample of blood will be taken to measure your wrist in glucose treat, the glucose dense. Drink will then be consumed and blood sugar levels will be measured every 30 to 60 Minutes for anywhere from one to three hours, depending on what your results are. It may necessitate taking more measurements injection test. This is used very infrequently by consists of  Of glucose being injected directly into your vein and then measurements of your blood sugar are taken one, two, and three minutes after the injection. This test is not recommended for diagnosis of type 2, or gestational diabetes, side effects, in terms of risks are side effects to taking this test. There are very few, some women experience, nausea following the ingestion of the glucose mixture.  Particularly because they have had too fast for the previous eight hours. The sudden burst of glucose may cause symptoms of nausea, but this should pass quickly. Thirstiness is also a common side effect of the test. But this is easily remedied. Once you are allowed to drink beverages again, results, the results of a glucose tolerance. Test, are relatively easy to read and understand.  Two hours after you consume the glucose solution, your blood sugar should return to below 140 mg. / the L. If your blood sugar level stands between 140, 199 mg Flash, the L. After 2 hours, it could indicate that you have pre-diabetes two hours after the test. If your blood sugar is above 200 mg /, the L. It is a good indication that you have type 2 diabetes.  Beetus glucose tolerance test for gestational diabetes as mentioned earlier. Most pregnant women will be given the glucose tolerance test to determine whether they are suffering from gestational diabetes. A common problem for many pregnant women. The results are red slightly differently in this situation. This will be an oral version of the glucose test and a similar glucose solution will be drunk.  Using a one hour test, your doctor will measure whether your blood. Sugar is above 140, mg Flash, the L. If it is, he will recommend a three-hour test to determine whether you are pre-diabetic for the severity of your condition. If your result is over, 190 milligrams Flash, the L after one hour, you will be diagnosed with gestational diabetes and you will need to change your diet and make certain adjustments.

He received his mbbs at the University of the West Indies in, Kingston Jamaica. And then a PhD from Oxford University. He was a chief resident and internal medicine at Northwestern. He spent a little time in Boston at a place called Harvard and then I moved to the University of Utah for 13 years where he moved through the ranks from assistant to full professor and medical director of the diabetes and Endocrinology Center. But since 2013, he's been at the University of Iowa and  Initially as director of the division of endocrinology and metabolism. And now, as the Francois Abboud chair in Internal Medicine as well as Department executive officer, which means he runs the place. So he obviously must have skills.

So please join me in welcoming dr. Day labeled.  Thank you very much for joining oats in this. Tremendous snow storm that has closed down. Montgomery, County, and having come from two places. Where there's real snow. I always wanted very, very interesting how the rest of the world reacts to the threat of snow. Nevertheless. I'm going to spend the next 45 minutes or so. I'm speaking to you about some work that we have been doing over the years. Really trying to understand.  The mechanisms that relate to cardio, cardio, vascular, complications of diabetes. Now, it shouldn't be lost. I think most people in this room that we have really seen a tremendous increase in the prevalence of obesity and diabetes over the last two or three decades. And in fact, this is a slide that I know that grief has used quite a bit in his presentation. That really, there's been an exponential increase in the number and the percentage of people  With diabetes in the u.s. I think it's also important to emphasize that diabetes really is a global epidemic. And even although we think about the numbers in the u.s. Does note that in the developing World sub-Saharan Africa, for example, and in the Middle East, you're seeing double and triple digit increases in the expected incidence and prevalence of diabetes between now and twenty forty five.  The reason why I diabetes is something that we really need to worry about our it's complications. And when I was in medical school, we learned about the microvascular complications of diabetes. So retinopathy a leading cause of blindness nephropathy. A leading cause of renal failure, neuropathy a cause of pain, limb loss. But really, the elephant in the room is cardiovascular complications of diabetes. And often times when we think about that we think about atherosclerosis em eyes.  And stroke, but I'm going to suggest to you today. That is another diabetic complication, which is heart failure. And I think that's largely unrecognized. I hope to kind of show you in the go to this talk. Why that needs to be changed. This is a classic study done. Almost two decades ago. Looking at about 10,000 individuals and looking at the both the prevalence and incidence of heart failure across the  Lifespan of individuals with type 2 diabetes and you can see very clearly that at all ages. There is an in a significant increase in heart, failure incidents in individuals with and diabetes. Roughly a two-fold to three-fold increase in either the incidence or prevalence of heart failure. Among individuals with diabetes was very interesting, the study. They actually looked for what could be potential predictors of heart failure in this population and some of them were not unexpected. Such as ischemia.  Heart disease hypertension or renal failure, but very interesting than this has really held true. Is that if you are diabetic and you are a woman than your risk for Hartford is actually twice as high as the risk for heart failure. If you are diabetic, man, and we still actually don't fully understand why that is,  The other interesting thing that came out of the study is that if you are an insulin user, then you also are at somewhat greater risk of heart failure in diabetes. And this is kind of an interesting Association because it raises the question is incident. Use a proxy for duration or severity of diabetes or is insulin use. Maybe giving us another clue potentially about the underlying pathophysiology and I will hope during the talk to show you some data that suggests that hyperinsulinemia itself.  Might potentially contribute to the increased risk of heart failure, which occurs in the context of diabetes.  Here's a, here's a recent study. That was recently published by Justin a true Fortune guy currently at the Brigham and Women's Hospital. Really was just looking at at hospitalizations for Hartford and asking how many what percentage of people with heart. Failure diagnosis are diabetic. Remember in the population is 10 to 15 percent. But in the heart failure, population is about 50% of individuals with heart, failure are diabetic. And in fact, if you look at the  Of heart failure, whether it's heart failure with reduce ejection fraction bar than it is in fraction or preserved. Ejection fraction. There is significant enrichment. In those populations with individuals who are diabetic now, heart failure, you know, we need to heart failure moonshot because if you look at the slide cancer, cancer, cancer, cancer heart failure, so it turns out that the mortality of heart failure is actually significantly worse than  Many Cancers. And if you are diabetic, your prognosis is even worse than if you are not. And let me give you two examples of that. This is another paper from Justin's group that's looking at people with Advanced heart, failure who required resynchronization therapy, are an implantable defibrillator and just looking at their survival and you can see in the blue that if you are diabetic, your chance of survival was significantly worse than if you were non-diabetic.  So it raises the question. Then why is this? And so clearly, one of the obvious things look at is glycemic control. So, if you aggressively control is less, robust. Are you at greater risk of heart failure? And in fact, this meta-analysis would suggest. In fact that this is the case that if you have an increase in hemoglobin A1c, with the exception of this one study that, in fact, your risk for heart failure is Amplified.  So if grassy me control a higher risk for heart failure, then the question becomes does improve glycemic control, reduce your risk for heart failure.  And so the question then is, what is the impact of glycemic control on the on the outcome before I show you the data in heart failure. Let me remind you of a number of landmark trials that some of which were funded by the NIH that looked at the impact of tights blasphemy control on a number of cardiovascular endpoints. And this was a big wake-up call from Universe in the field because in all of these trials that looked at a variety of ways of achieving tight control.  Divisions with type 2 diabetes. The couple interesting messages. One people weren't necessarily living longer and secondly in some studies not all it appear that maybe there was an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Now if one looks at the relationship between diabetes therapists and and heart failure. The picture is somewhat mixed that some medications looking across a broad swath.  Of epidemiological literature would suggest that if you are on these medicines that they either could, potentially exacerbate or increase your risk for heart failure. Where's a few others, including new agent such as sglt2 Inhibitors, and of course the standby, metformin may actually be somewhat beneficial in the context of heart failure. Let me give you a couple examples of this from the literature. So this is an analysis of those same tile control trials. I just mentioned  Earlier looking at the impact of any of these trials on the risk for heart failure. And the way that you look at these data is that if in fact, tight control was beneficial than you would be on this side. If tight control was less beneficial you'd be on this side. Most studies are kind of two to the left of this line. Again, suggesting that there's something about intensive control that may not necessarily be good for  The failing heart.  Here's another example. This is a silver. Timmy try looking at a dpp-4 inhibitor, saxagliptin. And one of the signals that they saw earlier, this trial, was that in the green, where their patients randomized, the saxagliptin relative to Placebo in this were looking at the hospitalization for heart failure. And you can see that there is actually a significant increase in heart rate of hospitalizations. In those people who were randomized to the dpp-4 inhibitor. This was a drill that never\",\n",

So for this assignment, you have just been newly diagnosed as a diabetic and you are being taught how to use the carbohydrate counting system to make out a meal or a daily meal plan. So we'll go through and show you how to do that. So that's one of our outcomes is to hopefully give you  a good overview of what carbohydrate county is so that if you ever are in a situation, a hospital where they're talking about a diabetic or and dealing with carbohydrate counting, or there may be some cases that you might be talking to the patient about carbohydrate counting, maybe helping them The dietitian will normally be the one who instructs the patient in cardiac.  Counting and they sometimes it takes a long time especially with individuals who don't have a high degree of Education. They may not be good with numbers and those kinds of things. So it may take a while you might may or may not be surprised. How many people do not know what foods contain carbohydrates? One of the things that a dietitian will do is  Normal fever, seeing those plastic models that look like food and they look pretty close to being food. Actually in one one time when I was doing a patient, their little boy. Actually, the patient was the mother. And the little boy actually took one of the hot dogs and try to take a bite out of it, you know, and they're plastic but and so from then on we had this hot dog with a little teeth marks in it. So it was always a good story anyway, so The dietitian will put those  Those plastic food out there. And one of the things they'll do is say, would you show me which of these foods are high in carbohydrates? And a lot of patients will choose a ground beef, patty, and or they'll choose chicken or they'll choose in in. So, they do not know what foods are high in carbohydrates. And so you have to teach them, you know, the rice and the in the Breads and that kind of thing are.  High in carbohydrates and they won't know which is high in protein or fat or anything else. So, anyway, so it is a task sometimes to teach people about carbohydrate counting, especially when you're using numbers and trying to determine what foods are high in carbohydrates proteins, and that kind of thing. So, it does take a while and usually, you'll bring in the person who's a diabetic but also the individual.  Would be preparing the meals and kind of it's almost a whole family deal. So everybody's kind of on the same page. So that's one thing I want to do is one of the outcomes is to just kind of force you to do one of these. So, you know, when when the words come up, well, we're going to teach them how to do carbohydrate counting. You'll be in the ballpark and you'll say, yeah, I remember doing that and then you also can  both eyes with the anyone who has to follow this, because it is very regimented and you may or may not be surprised that 83% of people were put on a carb counting plan. Don't use it. They they don't comply. So only about 70 percent, actually comply with this. But anyway, so let's go through and let's look at how we're going to do this. What we're going to use is your three-day diet data, so you need to get that.  All daily report and go to the bar graph here. Go to the values section and then we're going to look at the carbohydrates. We're going to look at the proteins. We're going to look at the fats, and we're going to determine how many choices there are. So in the carb counting plan. We don't use servings. We use choices. That's the terminology. And for carbohydrates. 15 grams, equals, one choice. And  A protein 7 grams is one choice for fat 5. G is considered a choice. So we'll look at and go through. And when we put this together, they'll be certain serving sizes that are equal to 15 grams for carbohydrates. And so, that amount of servings would equal one choice of carbohydrates. So basically you would then go to here's your bar graph.  You'll see up here and then you go to the value section, which is the column that shows what you actually ate. So you go to the protein and remembers, we said proteins, / 7 G. So we're going to choose we're going to determine how many meet choices. I actually ate how many carbohydrates. So the carbohydrate grams divided by 15 and then fat by 5. So in this case, I ate this amount of choices, so this  Could be a reference to you just came in and The dietitian went over your meals, what you normally eat and then they would come up with something like. Well, this is where you are right now. Okay, or you want to be though is what we're going to deal with with the dri goals. So your dri's are your goals of where you should be. So you're going to go to the bar graph there. And you're going to go to the dri goals here on this side, and then you're going to do the same thing.  So protein / 7 cards by 15 and fats by 5 and then you'll get these choice. Now. These choices are what we're going to be using to figure out our meal plan. So, the values were where we are. Now the dri goals values or choices are where we need to be. So you could just kind of visually compare those and kind of think. Well, I, if you were just diagnosed as a diabetic, you would say, okay. Well, this is where  where I am. This is where I have to be. In some cases, you may look at and say, wow, if I was a diabetic, I'd really have to change my food intake because you know what, I'm eating way more protein, not enough carbohydrate kind of thing. Or you may say, well, I'm pretty close. So I wouldn't have to change too much. Maybe a little adjustment here there, but the choices are going to be important because they're based on your insulin intake. So insulin is going to work.  Based on in, no matter if you eat or not, but so you need to get the adequate amount of carbohydrate choices. So that you don't either have not enough insulin to take care of, so, become hyperglycemia core. You don't eat enough carbs, then you'd become hypoglycemic because insulin would take too much sugar out of your blood. So the carb choices are going to be the key, but then we also need to spread out the meat, fat choices over the whole day. So our goal is going to be  To take these choices and even them out throughout the whole day as best as we can, especially the carbohydrate choices because they're the ones that are going to determine sugar levels. So we need to even those out as best we can throughout the day. So we have kind of an equal amount of sugar going into the bloodstream, and we don't have one big rush of carbohydrates where we eat a huge carbohydrate.  Or something, we get a big rush and our body is just not ready to be prepared to deal with it. And so we could get hyperglycemic that kind of thing. So anyway, let's go through and look at how we're going to distribute these choices throughout the day. So you go into your assignment. You'll see this front page basic where you can put your name and date on there. And then what we're going to do is we're going to go through the meal plan for the  the day we're going to fill in the carbohydrates, the meat, and the fats with our choices, Distributing them as evenly as possible. Throughout the day at the meat and fats won't be as critical as the carbohydrates again because the carbs are going to be, you know, giving the blood that sugars. So we're going to fill out the boxes evenly throughout the day, based on how many choices we have. Then, we're going to choose foods to meet those choices.  Is with their adequate serving sizes. And we'll talk about the vegetables here in a minute. But this is where you're going to see. You're going to have a blank sheet and then you're going to have boxes. Here that basically are where you're going to put your carbohydrate choices. You can put in a time and I don't care if you make it up or not, and then remember carbohydrates or 15 grams for every choice. So, again, if you had two choices to be 30 grams of carbohydrates, and so,  We're going to do is fill out this meal plan as if we were a diabetic and using our choices from the dri to fill out this out. So if you remember, I came up with my calculator. I had 23 choices of carbs. I had nine meats and 16 fats. So first, we're going to look and try to distribute the cards. So what I just arbitrarily said was, okay. I'm going to have for carbohydrate choices for breakfast. I'm going to have to for a morning snack and I'm going to have for lunch time, so that would  For a 10 out of 23. So for the afternoon snack the dinner and the evening snack, I would have 13 choices left to distribute. Okay. So anyway, so what we're going to do then is is looking at the carbohydrates. We need to determine what foods can we eat that? Will represent four choices or two choices or four choices for lunch. So let's look  Through. So you should you will in your assignment page have these choices. Actually two pages of carbohydrate choices. You can choose from basically list of food, it lists the serving size, and that list how many choices that serving size represents. So I'm just going to go in and make up a meal. And I basically said, okay, I'm going to I like waffles. So I'm going to have a waffle. Well, 1/4 inch waffle is equal to one choice.\",\n",

And that's where my research began. The goal of treatment in type 2. Diabetes is to achieve and maintain optimal, blood glucose lipid and blood pressure levels to prevent or delay. Chronic complications of diabetes. Many people with type 2 can achieve blood glucose control by following a nutritious meal plan and an exercise program losing excess.  Gasps wait, implementing necessary, self-care behaviors and taking oral medications. Although others may need supplemental insulin. Now, diet and physical activity are essential in managing and preventing type 2 diabetes. They help treat the associated. Glucose lipid blood pressure control abnormalities as well. As Aid in weight loss and maintenance when medications are used to control type 2 diabetes. They should augment lifestyle improvements, not replace them.  Now 2010 study by the American College of sports medicine made the following conclusion. Quote exercise plays a major role in prevention and control of insulin resistance, pre diabetes, gestational, diabetes type 2 diabetes, and other diabetes related Health complications, both aerobic and resistance, training, improve insulin action, at least acutely and can assist with the management of blood glucose levels lipids, blood pressure.  Cardiovascular risk mortality and overall quality of life, but exercise must be undertaken regularly to have continued benefits and likely include regular training of various types. Now, most people with type 2, diabetes can perform exercise safely, but you there are certain precautions, you need to take. But the inclusion of an exercise program or other means of overall, physical activity is crucial for Optimal Health, in individuals with type 2.  There's no question that exercise is good.

       " '_sMkl9fVfoE': \"A massive interest in this topic that they call Low T. In fact, Time Magazine had a major article on andropause which is the male version of menopause. So bottom line folks. There are low T clinics cropping up everywhere. We know that the Suzanne Somers started with her books. I think the sexy years, which talked about bioidentical hormone therapy, which centered on testosterone anti-aging clinic so many stars and  Charlotte's are boosting their hormones and testosterone is really, really key because this is what it does for you. Now, we know obviously it's produced in the testes for men but it's also produced in the pituitary gland and that's how women have testosterone. But bottom line is this testosterone helps you build muscle, it helps you burn body fat, it puts you in a good mood, right? It certainly increases reproductive function sexual function.  Sarah, which is one of the biggest reasons why people use it, but it really creates youth. Many people believe that testosterone levels. As they dive, you have an increase in wrinkles. You certainly have an increase in that saggy affect lose rapid muscle mass, and it is really important for so many other things. And when it comes to women, a lot of those symptoms that we ascribe to menopause. And we did a show on that recently where we talk about the hot flashes, the irritability.  Leti, the mood swings. The reproductive challenges testosterone is one of the best.  Things. Or it's a hormone to help women sail through menopause. Your testosterone is rapidly, decreasing in the reason being. Is that a lot of the hormone disruptors, the endocrine disruptors in our environment are causing us to have low testosterone, as is and this is a big one, our increase in cortisol. Yeah. So we're going to talk a little bit about how DHEA plays a role in keeping testosterone and levels. Good. And you know, what else? The low-fat craze caused a major Plumbing.  Ting in testosterone. And here's another one, the onset and large use of statin drugs. So I actually met people that show me on a Statin drug and my cholesterols in the 90s. If you have super low cholesterol, due to Staten drugs. Your testosterone is likely very low because sex hormones androgens are made from cholesterol and fats, but here's the deal, if you want to boost your energy, get in a better mood, build muscle burn, fat improve.  Active and sexual function and sailed through menopause. If you are of that age, you want to boost testosterone. And this is not a medicine. We're not talking about bioidentical hormones, right? These are eight secrets to boost testosterone for men and women and I bet you haven't heard but three of them. Yeah, absolutely. So as Jordan saying, any balancing out testosterone is key, both for men and women and Jordan. I know we see these commercials all the time. If you watch ESPN, we've got Frank Thomas and there's always talking about it. And because  Cuz, you know, you know why it's actually the most play. And I'm not, I don't know this for a fact, but I know I watch a lot of ESPN and I would say three times more than any other commercial. I've seen, are those low testosterone ads for men on sports stations. I mean, obviously, this is an epidemic that's affecting a lot of men as Jordans talking about especially. And so, if you're a woman watching this, affects you, if you're a man watching or if you're a wife and have a husband at home. This is information that can  Really helped transform their overall health. So help us spread this word on how to naturally bounce testosterone. Take a second right now, punch your share button. Click your like button. Let's help. Spread this word sojourn, let's jump in. And by the way, a Julie, here are Jackie. Curtsinger just said she shared this awesome Jackie. Hey, thanks for being on Mission today. Jordan. I'll talk about this first one here, resistance training. So resistance training. This is really important. If you want to naturally, get those testosterone levels up to when we went  through this, as we talked about, especially in the 70s and 80s, this whole Marathon running craze, low-fat craze, to of the worst things you can do for your testosterone levels. The best thing is lifting weights, getting loads of healthy fats in the diet. So, again, one of the best things you can do is weight training. When you weight train, your body starts, releasing human growth hormone, healthy levels of testosterone. It really is a natural hormone balance or so lifting weights.  Adding muscle, it's a key thing to do. And I know a lot of women. I remember Jordan. I actually started off sort of my health care as a personal trainer and a lot of the women would I would have them. Sure doing weight training and typically, always by the second session. They would come up to me and they'd say, hey, I really don't want to look bulky. Should I really be lifting weights? And I'd say hey, you know what? This is actually going to help you lean out and lose weight. It's not going to cause you to look bulky now, because women don't have as much testosterone, normally, but remember it's not about having a  A lot of testosterone, it's about having the right amount and I believe that people over 30 today, particularly over 40, have maybe about half the testosterone, the free testosterone that they should. And there's reasons for it. We're going to get into it but resistance training and interval training, Sprint's burst fit as you develop those all help to increase growth hormone and testosterone. And when you've got that going it's a fountain of youth. Yeah, absolutely. And another unique thing, Jordan and I read an article. This was in a book. Actually, I was  But could the Okinawan diet and they compared men in there. One over 100 and Okinawa versus men in their 70s in the US and they found that men and Okinawa actually had doubled the levels of free testosterone, then men in the 70s in North America. I mean, it was crazy. Crazy difference in free testosterone levels. So we know that again, there are other countries doing some of the right things. Then again, resistance training can be big during talk to us about number two here ashwagandha and how this can help and tell us about this.  And how it works. Absolutely. Well, ashwagandha is an adaptogen, and when we're talking about testosterone, we need to understand that there are two Dynamic hormones in the body cortisol, which is released by The adrenals. Cortisol is great for a fight or flight when you're in danger, but it also causes you to put weight around the midsection, to cause you to store fat not sleep very well. Imbalance, blood sugar and age and get angry. DHEA is another hormone that is should be in balance.  With cortisol. So as DHEA goes up, cortisol goes down. It has an inverse effect. Ashwagandha has been shown to decrease cortisol, increase DHEA and dramatically increase free testosterone. So look for a nashwa Ganda extract and you're looking for a compound called with an Allied. So you want ashwagandha root extract. It is clinically studied in double-blind randomized, clinical trials to boost free.  Testosterone. It is awesome. It will distress. You, you need it. Bottom line is really, really important. Yeah, and this is an herb. That's beneficial for so many things as Jordans talking about, you know, adaptogen herbs, help your body better adapt and deal with stressors and Jordan. I mean, all the time, we talk about diet here on the show, but we also talked about a lot of other lifestyle factors, not getting enough, sleep and emotional stress. Emotional stress can really cause cortisol to go up, can cause testosterone and human growth hormone to stay.  Low in the body. We need to balance those things out. So again adaptogen to help your body deal with stress. And if you also specifically have a thyroid condition, we really believe that ashwagandha is one of the essential herbs for helping specifically balance thyroid levels as well. And all of these hormones. We know can be interconnected and related. And here's one thing that's important. None of these eight secrets are going to increase testosterone beyond your normal range when you take medication or bioidentical.  Moans you need to be monitored because that will drive your levels past normal. Nothing, here is a hormone. These are balancing the body and influencing the hormones in a positive way. So if you're out there saying, oh, no, I don't want my testosterone to go up. If you're an athlete, none of these are banned substances. Yeah. This is naturally supporting the testosterone that should already be there. Ashwagandha is a great when fenugreek seed you mentioned the commercial that were forced to watch all the time. Fenugreek seed has been clinically proven.  Proven to increase free testosterone and it's great for a lot of things. Fenugreek is an amazing seed / herb for your gut but it also boosts free testosterone and it does that do to something called an anti aromatize Ink Effect. So it lowers an enzyme called aromatase which inhibits estrogen, which allows testosterone and go up folks, estrogens block testosterone. Yeah. So if you block estrogens, you can increase testosterone, you're going to hear these.  Different secrets are going to balanced and boost testosterone for different reasons. We've got a concomitant, gah increase, so growth hormone, increase and lean body mass. So, the more muscle you have, the more testosterone you have in vice versa. Ashwagandha lowers, cortisol and increases DHEA and fenugreek is an anti Aroma taste substance. So right there that's three unique ways to boost testosterone and there's more coming. Yeah. Absolutely. I love fenugreek seed, you know another unique use for  Jordan, of course, many people know this but is there increasing breast milk supply? Oftentimes fenugreek is used for that. It's also sometimes used as a digestive Aid, so it's even can be good for the digestive system. So fenugreek a really great herb for that and these are things that can be done. Typically ashwagandha is done in a capsule form as a supplement. Also fenugreek. You can do it as a supplement but also often times people do it as an herbal tea as well. So it's a great way to be getting that in your diet. If you want to start off every morning. You want to start doing a sort of a remedy for this, you can just do a little bit of  Lemon juice, and some water, some fenugreek, or even add that to something like a golden milk tea. Could be really beneficial. You can Sprout fenugreek and have fenugreek Sprouts. That is an awesome source of enzyme Lovett. Jordan talk to us about truffle. This is something that might surprise some people, but it might want to be one of the biggest Heroes on this lab solutely. So this is something that you've never heard before, but truffle actually stimulates free testosterone within the normal range. Just through inhalation. I don't have time to tell you about this amazing research.  Through olfaction similar to essential oils. A small amount of truffle on the molecular scale, increases free testosterone in men and women over 50 by up to three hundred percent. And they had did a small pilot study that showed women who were having menopausal issues. So the hot flashes, the irritability, the dryness they had an almost.\",\n",

But, you know, trying to find a way to talk about this. That is understandable. And that will mean something to you. And your practical everyday life is something that I'm always concerned with last year in October of last year.  15. I took a insulin test, actually, a test to test my insulin levels, both when I'm fasted. And after I took a glucose load of just pure sugar.  To see what would happen in my insulin levels. This test is called the craft pre-diabetes test and it's a blood spot test that you can order from a company called Meridian Valley. I think is the name of it. Yeah, Meridian Valley lab. Now, I'm not promoting Meridian Valley lab on here. I don't get any money from it for this Channel or anything else, but I have used them and I always limit  What I say on this channel, to something that I have done myself and that I know has results that I can depend on, so I can pass those on to you. Listen, guys, blood sugar is something that you can test very easy back in the late 60s, 70s, they developed a fairly easy home test that you can do and it's gotten better and cheaper as its went along. You can prick your finger, you can prick wherever  The prick on your body and you can get a little blood and these test devices are, you can buy them anywhere and you can find out what your blood sugar readings are both, when you're fasted and after you eat or whatever you can do tests and people do this. Lots of people do this. And in a lot of ways, it's really good because you can kind of test. How food is is doing what it's doing to your body, you know, we're all different, you know.  People respond to Foods differently. So, you know, you really need to know what some foods are doing to you. But the focus of this channel has always been a from the very beginning, not on blood sugar, but on insulin and honestly, at this time, 2016, as far as I know, there is no simple.  Immediate home test for insulin. If there is someone needs to write me and let me know about it because I'd like to know about it. As far as I know to get your insulin levels tested. You have to either go to a doctor and get a test.  Which may not help you and will explain that in just a few minutes. It'll help you a little, no. But we really need to know more than that or you can order a test as far as I know. There are maybe more than companies that do it, but I know that this Meridian Valley and I've got a  My test right here.  Meridian Valley in California, has a test that you can order, they send you a little packet and I'll show you more about that later and you take and prick your finger, and you have to do little five blood spots for every hour for four hours to to see your insulin patterns. Not just when you're fasted, but also after you've had a sugar load in your body and the reason  They do that. They're testing. Something based on the research of a doctor that I greatly admire, and have talked about a lots of times on this channel. Dr. Joseph craft. Dr. Kraft, at this time of still living and vital and active. He's in his 90s, and there's a great video interview with him here on YouTube by Ivor Cummings.  And that's a video you need to see and I'm going to link to it in this and and this video you need to go over and watch that video. So you can learn much more about dr. Kraft actually, from him and from Iver and Ivers channels. Great, by the way, it's if you're if you're the kind of person that likes to get some more in-depth, learning about the stuff that's a challenge, you need to watch for sure. My channels more entry-level.  But dr. Kraft learned, he was a doctor and still is a doctor but not practicing it. This time. He was a doctor that learned that people have a hidden problem that they don't know a lot about. Everybody depends on blood sugar either their fasting blood sugar or they can take glucose tolerance test, you know, where they take a glucose load and they look at their sugars after that. And that's how they diagnose them with.  Diabetes. But you know, blood sugar and insulin do not really match each other. For example, you could have high blood sugar and you can have very low insulin and that's what you would call type 1, diabetes or you could have fairly normal to even high blood sugar.  And have also High insulin and we would call that type 2 diabetes because the insulin is actually high in type 2 diabetics, but because of insulin resistance and that's really what type 2 diabetes is the insulin resistance disease, or insulin resistance problem. The insulin is high, but your body doesn't react to it the way it should. So there's an example.  Couple of blood sugar being fairly normal or a little above normal or maybe even a lot above normal and Insulin also being very high. So that's not a match. But dr. Kraft found something even more more important for people like you. And I  he found that about 80% of people who would pass a blood sugar test fasting, blood sugar test or a glucose tolerance test would if they took his test which tests insulin levels. They would fail that test.  They would not only fail it, but they would be what he would call a diabetes in seat. You, in other words. They were what we would call pre-diabetic, they have this underlying hyperinsulinemia. There's a two dollar word for you. If you ever heard one, hyper insulin, emia, chronically, High insulin levels that are underneath and unseen, and for the most part, by most doctors, not tested it all and  So for years and years and years, before they get this diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, they have this High insulin pattern going on underneath the hood and they don't even know it. Their doctors don't know it. No one knows it. And if we tested for it as dr. Kraft has pushed almost too. No one's listen to him, but I think they will.  We could probably find people who were in trouble decades.  Maybe two decades or at least one decade before they were ever diagnosed with diabetes. They would know that they were heading that way.  And this is something that you need to know, but the problem with this Meridian Valley test that that I took last year. Two things. One is expensive. Yeah. This test is like 200 bucks. You can order it. It's two hundred dollars out of your pocket. It comes and you've got a fast for the whole night, which a lot of you do anyway, and then you gotta drink some nasty pure.  House and you got to test your levels by pricking your finger and getting blood spots, pretty big blood spots. I might add and you pack all the stuff back up and send it off and I sent, I got mine. See, I did it in October. Let me see. I've got it here on my computer.  I've got it. I did it in October of  The October 13th of 2015 but I didn't get my results back until November the second. So it was a good two and a half three weeks before I actually got my lab results back and I was pleased with the results, but that tells you how difficult it is to get this test and the results back on the test. So when someone says I'm in, I know what my insulin level is.  A tie. I know for sure that they're a little bit confused on that, because as far as I know, it's not possible to know that that faster that easy not at home.  So this is really important and the, the biggest thing that we need to know about. Dr. Crafts work, is that he tested well over 10,000 people in his career and like I told you 80% of them that looked good as far as blood sugar goes, looked bad as far as insulin goes.

That's actually the same four or five liters recycled over and over delivering oxygen and precious nutrients.  Like glucose and amino acids to the body's tissues, all that blood exerts, a force on the muscular walls of the blood vessels that force is called blood pressure and it rises and falls with the phases of the heartbeat. Its highest during systole, when the heart contracts to force blood through the arteries. This is your systolic blood pressure. When the heart is at rest between beats blood pressure Falls to its lowest.

The properties of the fluid extra fluid or narrower pipes. So if the blood thickens a higher pressure is needed to push him.

Your healthcare provider will have one to just give you generally you can get a glucometer kit for free with enough supplies to get you started. You will then pay for the strips and lancets each month or however often you will need them before we get into how to use the glucometer. I think it's important for us to know and explore some other areas concerning the task.  Of taking blood sugar readings. Why do you need to monitor your blood glucose? Well, monitoring blood glucose. They lie is simply a vital part of managing diabetes. It's also important because it empowers you to be in charge of your disease. No matter what, your treatment plan, consists of blood sugar monitoring, gives you immediate feedback into how well your plan is doing. Is it working?  Checking your blood glucose gives you the freedom to make choices without worry, the confidence to learn from your actions, and the motivation to keep striving to do better. That's according to Linda, Dale, who's a clinical nurse? Specialist in the outpatient, diabetes, education program at the University of Michigan. She goes on to say, monitoring tells you what you're doing, either is working or it isn't. And it serves as motivation to keep up actions that are working or to make  Inches. Now, what do all these numbers mean? Well knowing what the numbers mean is very important in regards to taking blood glucose readings. If you know everything about getting the numbers, but don't know what they mean. You're wasting your time and effort knowing if your blood sugar is too high or too low or just right is vital and treating diabetes.  You were diagnosed with diabetes because of these numbers, your fasting blood glucose level was greater than 126 milligrams per Dal on two separate readings. This is the amount of glucose that was present in your blood after a time of not eating normal. Blood glucose levels are less than 100 blood glucose readings of 100 to 125 are considered pre-diabetes. You are shooting for a fasting blood glucose.  Of that 80 to 130 before each meal, which is called pre prandial a postprandial reading, which is one of the two hours after eating should be less than 180.  If you have a reading of less than 80 or you're considered hypoglycemic, this means your blood glucose level is getting too low. In this case. You'll need to get some carbs in your system. The recommended amount of carbs is 15 grams. And then check your blood sugar again, later. If your readings are extremely high, especially before eating saying the 180 range. Well, you may need to take a fast acting insulin to help bring it down. This should be discussed with your doctor.  And is one of the reasons taking blood sugar readings are so important. Regular monitoring is especially helpful for showing the positive effects of exercise, says Dale, say your readings have regularly been around 140, but you start taking a walk every day and you start getting more readings around 120. Well that will definitely boost your motivation.  Another question. I always ask about checking, blood sugar's, how often should I do it now? I personally am a proponent of taking it before, every meal, at least some Studies have found that the more often, people monitor their blood sugar, the better their A1C levels. Now, the A1C test is a measure of blood sugar control over previous two to three months. You don't do that on your own, your doctor will do that one for you. The Joslin Diabetes Center says that in  Perfect world people with type 1, diabetes, should monitor their blood glucose level six or seven times a day. However, that's often impractical because of time and resources. If a person is newly diagnosed starting a new treatment or having trouble with blood glucose control, whether type 1 or type 2, most insurance companies will pay for more strips than usual for the person to monitor more frequently. A person whose type 1 diabetes is in stable control should model.  After a minimum of four times a day now for those whose type 2 diabetes is in good control. Well, the Jocelyn Center recommends monitoring twice a day, but they also say the majority of patients with type 2 are not in good control and should check more often. Unfortunately, health insurance companies, often cover only one or two test strips per day for people with type 2, which many experts feel isn't really enough.  To offer useful information. Now, in some cases insurance companies will cover more strips. If a doctor writes, a script for more and some people choose to buy more strips on their own out of pocket. Now, yes, test strips are expensive, but the price is really not gone up in the past 20 years. They cost about a dollar, a strip no more expensive than a bottle of water, or a cup of coffee. So sometimes you just made need to make a choice right there. Now monitoring your blood sugar before meals.  Gives you a baseline reading of your blood sugar before you eat, and I really think that is important. So does Amanda by Sue and doctor from the Mayo Clinic? She says, this is the best time to check your blood sugar. So, you know what it is before you start the meal, once you eat your blood sugar is going to go up, but the Baseline should be back to normal by your next meal. Now, if your Premier readings are in the recommended range in your A1C results, are in the  It range. Dr. Basu says it monitoring after meals really isn't necessary. Okay. So, how do you check your blood glucose? Well, there's a chart on your screen and it will kind of give you a visualization of what I'm going to say. The first thing you need to do is wash your hands. Now. This is very important. You're going to be invading your finger with a Lancet. It's necessary to have your hands clean. I personally keep a small bottle of hand sanitizer in my glucometer kit by very large.  Large bottle refill, the smaller one, when empty to save money. So after you've washed your hands, you're going to prepare your supplies. You get out your glucometer, your test strip, and the landsat device. For most glucometers. You'll place a test strip in the glucometer and wait for it. To tell you to place a drop of blood on the Strip. You will choose a finger to draw blood from the Lancet. Device is a spring-loaded device and most require you to set the spring by pulling back on the device somewhere.  I could use a fresh Lancet every time and look for instructions on how to change your lancets.  You will then put the Lancet device firmly on the finger of your choice. Then to press a button that will allow the Lancet to make a very small hole in your finger, squeeze around that hole, get a drop of blood and it will come to the surface of the skin, then place that drop of blood on the test strip that is in your glucometer. Wait for the results. And one thing I do not have pictured on the screen because I ran out of room. Well, you need to write those results down now, there are several.  All good phone apps that are great for this that will keep them for you. So you don't have to have a separate piece of paper or a separate Journal. Some glucometers even have apps. That will document the results for you on your phone. Well, there you have it. Once you've done that you've successfully taken a blood glucose reading and hopefully, you know why you did. So.

Hepatitis happens to mean, inflammation of the liver. So it's reasonable to say that autoimmune hepatitis. Is this resulting inflammation of your liver tissue because they're being attacked by your own immune cells.  Like many autoimmune diseases, the root cause of autoimmune. Hepatitis is ultimately not super clear. But some researchers think it's a combination of environmental triggers and genetic predisposition.  It tends to occur most often in young women in the female to male ratio is about four. To one, also though, an important piece of the genetic puzzle is the human leukocyte antigen system shortened to HLA, which is this location of genes on chromosome, 6 that regulate our immune functions specifically these genes control, the proteins that are encoded and used on the cells. Surface to present foreign molecules to the immune system, but although they present antigens there. Also,  Form of antigen themselves. They aren't though the same type of antigen as one on an infectious molecule, but actually a low antigens that vary from person to person and are actually specific self proteins.  Usually, our thymus makes sure that the T cells that attack these self proteins aren't allowed to survive in autoimmune disease. There may be some abnormality associated with specific self proteins. That lets the T cells attack them.  Based on studying people with autoimmune hepatitis. They often have HLA DDR3 and ddr4 which are both MHC Class 2 surface receptors the Dr. Part refers to its location on the chromosome. For example, depending on the location. You could have hlaa, hla-b HLA, C, or HLA D, and HLA DS3 sub-regions. P q and R. So this one is HLA Dr.  So specifically with autoimmune hepatitis, there seems to be some sort of connection between these particular self proteins, the HLA Dr. And mounting an attack against your own liver.  Autoimmune. Hepatitis also tends to be associated with other diseases like Hashimoto's thyroiditis where your immune cells attack, your thyroid and Graves disease where your thyroid over produces thyroid hormones.  Clinically autoimmune, hepatitis patients can sit anywhere on a spectrum from completely asymptomatic to cirrhosis and fulminant. Hepatitis also known as acute liver failure or they might be somewhere in between with debilitating symptoms like fever jaundice, and hepatosplenomegaly a condition where both the spleen and the liver are way larger than their normal size. Probably caused by inflammation, due to immune cell attack.  Also, for symptomatic patients, will be this increase in blood transaminases. Usually, there's only a small amount of transaminases in the blood which are these enzymes that help. Metabolize amino acids, alanine aminotransferase or alt is mostly found only in the liver and aspartate aminotransferase or AST is found in both the liver as well as other tissues. So if the liver cells are damaged by immune cells, both, alt and AST start leaking out into the  the blood from the liver, but typically since alt is more associated with the liver, alt will be higher than a St. Even though they both will likely be elevated autoimmune. Hepatitis can be split into two types. Type 1 is the most common accounting for about 80% of autoimmune, hepatitis cases and is characterized by several lab findings. First. We'll look for antibodies to your own nuclei that are floating around in your blood. We also call these anti-nuclear antibodies or anacs.  And these antibodies have failed to be able to tell the difference between self and non-self. And so the end up being against the proteins in the nuclei of your own cells. Also along the same lines. We might find antibodies that are targeting your own smooth muscle, proteins as well. Decreased serum. Albumin is also a marker for autoimmune, hepatitis and damage to the liver. Usually serum. Albumin is produced in the liver. But if the liver becomes damaged serum albumin production, May decrease,  Finally an elevated, or prolonged Prothrombin time, which is the time. It takes your blood to clot is a typical lab finding in more severe cases.  Time to autoimmune. Hepatitis is way less common and is defined by the presence of antibodies to the microsomes of the liver or your kidney, a lkm one or two, a liver cytosol antigen ALC one. This type is most common in young girls and usually happens alongside another autoimmune disease.  As to treatment, initially patients can be given immunosuppressant medications. They may be given corticosteroids which help inhibit the immune responses that are mediated by both B and T cells.  Another drug, azathioprine has a similar immunosuppressant action and inhibits an enzyme that we need to synthesize DNA and so it's strongly inhibit cells, like T cells and B cells that proliferate a lot during an immune response. The patients are resistant to these drug therapies. They might have to undergo a liver transplant.\",\n",
       " 'fH4-_xFVmY': \"With fragile X syndrome. Sometimes just called fragile X. The X refers to the X chromosome where the disease genes located, The Fragile refers to the fact that under a microscope, the X chromosome looks fragile or broken at the side of the mutation. That's because the chromatin which makes up the chromosome gets really condensed at that point. Fragile X is a genetic disease that affects various organ systems.  Now, the gene for fragile X is called fmr1, which stands for fragile X mental retardation 1. Mental retardation is an old term for intellectual disability, which is one of the key features of fragile X syndrome.  The fmr1 gene has a triplet repeat or trinucleotide repeat, which means that a group of three DNA nucleotides is repeated multiple times in a row in fmr1. It's the nucleotide cytosine, guanine, and guanine or cgg.  These CGS are found in the 5 Prime untranslated region of fmr1. A 5 Prime untranslated region is the part of the DNA at the beginning of the gene that's made into mRNA but not protein and helps modulate gene expression.  Just Upstream from the 5 Prime untranslated region is fmr ones promoter the region that causes the gene to be transcribed into mRNA, which is usually turned on.  Expressed fmr1. MRNA gets translated into fragile X mental, retardation protein, or fmr p and it helps in development of the brain and other tissues.  In fragile X syndrome. There's a repeat expansion mean, there's an increased number of cgg repeats in the gene. This repeat expansion is caused by slipped Miss pairing, which is where the enzyme DNA polymerase gets confused. When copying a repetitive sequence. DNA polymerase loses its place among the fmr1. Triplet repeat sin goes back to recopy. Would it already just copied?  This is like getting lost in a video and watching the same part over and over.  But since DNA polymerase is making copies. The effect is an increase or expansion of the number of repeats. The normal number of cgg repeats is 5244.  Alleles with 45 to 54 cgg repeats are called intermediate expansion, alleles, and they don't cause any symptoms alleles with 55 to 200. Cgg repeats are called pre mutation alleles and they can cause some mild symptoms. Finally, if an allele has over 200, see Gigi's then it's considered a full fragile X syndrome mutation and can make the chromosome take on its distinctive look.  Alleles can tend to get longer and longer as DNA polymerase becomes more and more unstable copying the longer stretches of repeats. So an intermediate expansion allele can become a pre mutation, allele and a pre mutation allele can expand to become a full fragile X syndrome mutation.  The repeat expansion attracts. A DNA methylation enzyme to the site and causes the cytosines in the cgg repeats to become methylated. These bulky methyl groups, cause the chromatin, which is DNA wrapped around histones, to condense. When it's in a condensed form regions of the fmr1 gene can't be bound by transcription factors. As a result. The promoter of the fmr1 gene is locked in the off State. So it's product F Mr. P. Can't be made an adequate amounts.  And that leads to fragile X syndrome.  Fragile X can cause intellectual disability delayed speech and delayed motor development. For example learning to walk at 18 months instead of 12.  Many children with fragile X also develop autism ADHD and seizure disorders.  Individuals with fragile X syndrome, can develop classic physical features as well, like a long and narrow face a prominent jaw and forehead and large ears that stick out.  These facial features might not be seen in an infant but become obvious as the child becomes older.  Males can also have larger than normal testes after puberty.  Fragile X is typically milder and females than males and many females with the fragile X, mutation have no symptoms due to reduced penetrance.  This is because females have a normal backup copy of fmr1 on their other X chromosome. Skewing of x-chromosome inactivation. What is the process in development, where each cell picks One X chromosome to rely on can make a female more or less likely to show symptoms. Interestingly. Fmr1, expansions are almost always inherited from the mother.  Pre mutation carriers have too few repeats to get fragile X, but they can have other symptoms. For example, fragile X Associated Tremor, Ataxia. Syndrome are FFX. Tas FFX, Tas is an adult-onset Progressive neurological disease, that includes intention tremor, which is a shaking when movement is initiated a taxi, which can make walking difficult memory and cognitive problems and white matter changes, detected by brain MRI.  Female premeditation carriers. Can also get fmr1 related. Primary ovarian insufficiency with the ovaries shut down early in menopause starts before age, 40.  Fragile X FX Tas and fmr1 related. Primary, ovarian insufficiency are diagnosed by a DNA test that counts the number of cgg repeats. It's important to make the diagnosis in order to counsel the individual about the risks of the diseases in current and future family members. Fmr1. Testing is often done for individuals with intellectual disability developmental delay, or Autism and carrier. Testing can be done for pregnant women.  Treatment of fragile X is directed at individual symptoms. For example, special education for intellectual disability, stimulants for ADHD and evaluation by reproductive endocrinologist. For premature ovarian insufficiency.  All right, as a quick recap fragile, X syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by expansion of over 200. Cgg triplet repeats in the fmr1 gene on the X chromosome. It's more likely to cause symptoms in males than females. And these symptoms include intellectual disability and autism a long narrow face.

This is a medical emergency because you may be having a heart attack, a condition in which your heart muscle begins to die. Your heart is a muscular organ. That pumps blood, containing the oxygen and nutrients your body needs the main pumping chamber of your heart, is the left ventricle. When your left ventricle contracts, it sends oxygen-rich blood to your body, through a large artery called, the aorta connected to your, aorta are small arteries called coronary arteries, blood flows from your aorta, through the coronary arteries to supply, your heart muscle with oxygen and nutrients. If you have acute coronary syndrome, blood flow through your coronary arteries is severely reduced.  Or completely blocked.  One possible cause of reduced blood flow is atherosclerosis.  In this condition, a buildup of a fatty substance called plaque can narrow your coronary arteries. If this plaque, ruptures a blood clot can form and block the artery. A blood clot is the most common cause of coronary artery blockage.  Other less common causes of reduced, blood flow include coronary artery spasm or dissection.  In a coronary artery spasm triggers, such as drugs, smoking, cold weather and extreme stress, or emotions, can cause a temporary and sudden tightening of a coronary artery.  During a coronary Artery Dissection, the inside wall of one of your coronary arteries separates, which can block blood flow.  Regardless of the cause a blockage in either coronary, artery prevents the oxygen and nutrients in your blood from reaching the part of your heart supplied by the artery, as a result, heart muscle in that area starts to die.  Death of part of your heart muscle is called a heart attack. It's also known as a myocardial infarction or MI.  A blocked coronary artery may also cause you to feel sudden pain, discomfort, tightening or a burning sensation in your chest called angina.  This pain May extend to your upper abdomen, shoulders arms neck and lower jaw.  If you have angina, when you are at rest or frequent, angina that prevents even moderate physical activity, you have unstable angina, which is the main symptom of acute coronary syndrome.  Other symptoms of acute coronary syndrome, include shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea and sweating.  If you've had a heart attack or have other types of acute coronary syndrome, your doctor May prescribe oxygen therapy to get more oxygen into your blood.  You may take aspirin or other prescription blood, thinner drugs, to prevent blood clots.  Thrombolytics also known as clot Buster drugs. May be used to break up any existing blood clots.  Drugs such as nitroglycerin and morphine will relax your coronary arteries and relieve the pain of angina.  You may also receive drugs called beta blockers that, slow down your heart and reduce its need for oxygen.  Your doctor may also recommend immediate surgical procedures such as coronary angioplasty in which a balloon tipped, catheter inflates inside your blocked coronary, artery to open it. After inflating, the balloon catheter may leave behind a mesh, like device called a stent to hold your artery open.  Or you may have a coronary artery bypass graft or cabbage. Cabbage is a surgical procedure in which the blocked areas of the coronary arteries are bypassed with veins or artificial graft material.  Seek treatment immediately.

We found we've seen that over and over. So safety is a key in there are many resources to make sure that that your environment remains safe. The second is developmentally appropriate, the physical activity setting. We need to make sure that it is age-appropriate which we understand, but also individually appropriate, which means  so to provide very different equipment or different opportunities for children is really important.  Signs that we have of cognitive abilities are movement experiences while they're Physically. Active, all kinds of things are going on in their brain. All these new pathways are being being developed. We know that early childhood Specialists have a full plate. They have many things. They must get done each day. We're not asking you to put any of those aside and make room for physical activity. What we're asking is to infuse physical activity into your existing curriculum teacher. Claudia, a Hearn finds many.  Unity's to combine physical activity with cognitive activities in her classroom. Caps for sale is one of my favorite books. One of the reasons. I love the book is it's a great story, but you can also add movement with it. The children love when The Peddler gets angry. They love to shake their hands. They love to stamp their feet. Again. If children are engaged in the story. They really take an active part. Claudia also incorporates physical activity into her classroom transitions. I love to do movement.  As transitions in the classroom recently. I've been doing this gating transition or we call it the sliding transition where the children, put their feet on paper plates and they are on carpet and they slide across the classroom. And what's great about this lighting is children, can explore their bodies. They can move slowly, some children like to turn around some children, use their arms for balance some children fall.  And they pick themselves up. It's just a great opportunity for developmentally appropriate ways, children can move managing physical activity within the classroom does take planning and preparation, Ashley read and researched before. Introducing yoga to her. Preschool class. I was really nervous. When I first started doing yoga prior to actually having the yoga classes here. I did a lot of reading about children's and they have some really great resources and really great books that tell you how to conduct you ago.  So children and it's something that took a lot of introduction in order for us to kind of catch on and understand what it was about. But as the years progressed, it's something the children that really look forward to it. Something we don't need a lot of space for we can all fit on the carpet and sometimes we'll do it for 10 minutes and sometimes we'll do it for for and I can tell that they're ready to be done with yoga after 4 minutes. So it's nice too because you can really vary it depending on the needs of the children that day.  One of the biggest challenges to Bringing physical activity into the classroom can be space. Is there a place that you have a blank wall that you can throw at a sheet Target? Is there a place where there's a little mat on the floor? There may be already where they can do some different kinds of butterfly stretches or giraffe stretches, just things like that. That will actually enhance your program. So so much, whether you use some timing device or whether the children have a free choice, they'll choose this you'll find out, so you  Be adding some more movement in different stations, but children love to move and infusing that into your everyday. Curriculum is really what we're trying to make sure happens. I dramatic play center was transformed into a fitness center. We did that by placing photos of children and different movement positions, by having the physical posters on the wall. It also help the teachers engage the children. We also placed a mirror on the wall. So the children could see themselves.  Elves doing the movement probably the key to any successful dramatic play. Center is to have some intentional activities and half staff involvement. It's very important to make sure that everyone in your in your teaching facility is on board from the administrators down to two, are our assistants the best resource that any administrator can give. You is to put you in touch with a certified physical education specialist.  The director Kristen has been very supportive. As I said, we've had a challenging group of behaviors this year as well as energy level and she's been very supportive and me taking initiative and trying to come up together with new things that we could try. She was very excited about the yoga. When I first mentioned it and she helped me do some research as well. Involving parents is always an important goal of Early Childhood professionals, Claudia and Ashley have had success encouraging parents to engage in physical activity.  Activities with their children at home. We have a Weekly Newsletter which informs parents of what's happening in the classroom. I also invite parents into my classroom. If parents can see that, it's not difficult to move with their children, then they'll be like I can do that at home. I love having Claudia's handout. It's so great to have it on our fridge at home. Nathan is just such an active kid. Sometimes we run out of ideas of things to try. So having that handout, we can look at that and do something different with them every day.  Keep them interested and he's just so active that he loves doing it.  What we're trying to get at is instilling these healthy movement habits. Early on, we know that young children, develop most of their Habits, by the age of five choosing movement activity. Instilled in these children by age 5, we're all set if they keep on going throughout their, their Early Childhood, their childhood, their teen years into adult life. That's exactly what we want. That's what the research is telling us and that starts in the preschool years building, those foundations that will enable a child to become competent and  Confident. So that they will seek out those experiences later on.\",\n",

Also, don't forget to check out the link below to find out how this guy reversed his diabetes. Turns out the diabetes industry is selling Us, fake research. But back to our topic, diabetes is having a devastating effect on the African-American Community. Diabetes is the fifth leading cause of death in African Americans and their death rates are  Eighty-seven percent higher than whites over 2.8 million, African Americans, have diabetes, and one-third of them don't know. They have a disease in addition, 25 percent of African Americans between the ages of 65 to 74, have diabetes. And one in four African-American women over the age of 55 had been diagnosed with the disease. The cause of diabetes is a mystery but researchers believe that both genetics and environmental factors play roles in.  Who will develop the disease? Heredity researchers believe that African Americans and African immigrants are predisposed to developing diabetes, research suggests that African-Americans and recent African immigrants have inherited a Thrifty Gene from their African ancestors. This Gene may have enabled Africans to use food energy more efficiently during cycles of feast and famine. Now with fewer cycles of feast and famine this Gene. We make weight control more difficult.  For African Americans and African immigrants. This genetic predisposition coupled with impaired. Glucose tolerance is often associated with the genetic tendency toward high. Blood pressure, people with impaired glucose tolerance, have higher than normal blood glucose levels, and are at a higher risk for developing diabetes. What is diabetes? Diabetes. Commonly know as sugar, diabetes is a condition that occurs when the body is unable to properly produce or use insulin insulin.  Is needed by the body to process sugar starches and other Foods into energy. Diabetes is a chronic condition for which there is no known cure. Diabetes is a serious disease and should not be ignored diabetics. Often suffer from low glucose levels sugar, in their blood, low blood sugar levels can make you disorientated dizzy. Sweaty, hungry have headaches, have sudden, mood swings have difficulty paying attention or have tingling.  Sensations around the mouth types of diabetes. Pre-diabetes is a condition that occurs when a person's blood glucose levels is higher than normal, but not high enough for a diagnosis of type 2. Diabetes. Pre-diabetes can cause damage to the heart and circulatory system, but pre diabetes, can often be controlled by controlling blood glucose levels by controlling pre-diabetes. You can often prevent or delay, the onset of type 2, diabetes type 1 or juvenile onset.  Biddies, usually strikes people under the age of 20, but can strike at any age, five to ten percent of African Americans, who are diagnosed with diabetes are diagnosed with this type of the disease. Type 1, diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the body produces little or no insulin and this type of Diabetes must be treated with daily, insulin injections, type 2 adult-onset. Diabetes is responsible for 90 to 95 percent of diagnosed, diabetes risk.  Cases in African-Americans type 2 results from a condition where the body fails to properly use insulin. According to the American Diabetes, Association type 2 is usually found in people over 45, who have diabetes in their family, who are overweight, who don't exercise and who have cholesterol problems in the early stages. It can often be controlled with lifestyle changes, but in the later stages, diabetic pills or insulin injections are often.  Did pregnancy related diabetes or gestational diabetes can occur in pregnant. Women gestational diabetes is often associated with high glucose blood levels or hyperglycemia gestational, diabetes affects about 4% of all pregnant women. The disease usually goes away after delivery, but women who suffer from gestational diabetes are at a higher risk for developing diabetes later in life symptoms of diabetes the  Most common symptoms of diabetes include excessive urination, including frequent trips to the bathroom increased thirst increased appetite. Blurred vision unusual weight loss, increased fatigue irritability complications from diabetes, diabetes can lead to many disabling and life-threatening complications Strokes blindness. Kidney failure, heart disease. And amputations are common complications that effect.  African Americans who have diabetes kidney disease. Diabetes is the second leading cause of end stage kidney disease in African Americans accounting for about 30% of the new cases.

Diabetes is the leading cause of non-traumatic lower-limb amputations in the United States. More than 60%.  Scent of non-traumatic lower-limb amputations in America occur, among people with diabetes and African Americans are almost three times more likely to have a lower limb amputated due to diabetes than whites.

Well one lousy breakfast could double your C-reactive protein levels before it's even lunchtime.  Repeat that three times a day and you could set yourself up for heart disease though. You may not even be aware how bad off you are because your doctor is measuring your blood sugar and fat levels in a fasting State typically drawing your blood before you've eaten, but what happens after a meal maybe a stronger predictor of heart attacks and strokes which makes sense since this is where most of us live our lives in a Fed state.  And not just in diabetics if you follow non-diabetic women with heart disease, but normal fasting blood sugar how high their blood sugar spikes after chugging some sugar water appears to determine how fast their arteries continue to clog up perhaps because the higher the blood sugar Spike, the more free radicals are produced.

I want to emphasize that my perspective is coming from one with type 2 and not type 1 diabetes. Our channel is primarily for those with type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes today. I want to answer the question. Does everyone with pre-diabetes eventually get diabetes?  PT's after you watch the video today. I invite you to check out the description box for my new ebook. This is one of the most comprehensive diabetes meal planning books. You'll find anywhere it contains. Diabetes friendly meals and recipes recipes for different goals. Such as eight hundred, two 1800 calories per day, meal plans, diabetes meal, planning and tips and tricks. And there are also tons of diabetes friendly recipes for everyone.  The short answer. This question is no a diagnosis of prediabetes, doesn't mean you will get type 2 diabetes, but whether or not, you develop type 2 is totally up to you. You have the power to prevent it or you have the power to let your diagnosis progress. The American Diabetes Association says that serious lifestyle changes are effective in preventing, type 2, diabetes, after you've been diagnosed with pre-diabetes.  Uh diabetes, your doctor will walk you through what you need to change, but typical recommendations include eat. Well, a registered dietitian or a certified. Diabetes educator can help you create a meal plan, that's full of good for you. And good for your blood glucose level Foods. The goal of the meal plan is to control your blood, glucose level, and keep it in the healthy normal range. Your meal plan will be made just for you taking into account.  Out your overall health, your physical activity, and watch you like to eat exercise. When you exercise, your body uses more glucose. So exercising can lower your blood glucose level. Also, when you exercise, your body doesn't need as much insulin to transport the glucose, your body becomes less insulin resistant since your body isn't using insulin. Well, when you have pre-diabetes a lower insulin resistant, level is very  We good. And of course, there are all the traditional benefits of exercise, it can help you lose weight. Keep your heart healthy, make you sleep better and even improve your mood, the American Diabetes Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate activity a week. That's 30 minutes a day, five days a week. You can get that through activities such as walking bike riding or swimming.  Also lose weight. If you're overweight, you should get started on a weight loss program. As soon as you're diagnosed with pre-diabetes losing, just 5 to 10 percent of your weight. Can significantly reduce the risk of developing type 2, the combination of eating. Well and exercising, more is a great way to lose weight and then maintain your new healthy weight.  Metformin for people, who are at very high risk of developing type 2, diabetes after being diagnosed with pre-diabetes, your doctor May recommend a medication. The American Diabetes Association says, that metformin should be the only medication used to prevent type 2, it works by keeping the liver from making more glucose when you don't need it there by keeping your blood glucose level in a better range. Your doctor will keep a close watch on your blood glucose.  Evil's monitoring them to make sure that your pre diabetes doesn't become type 2 if needed. He, or she may suggest adjustments a different diet or more exercise to better control. Your blood glucose levels.

       " 'WtDnuys': \"Net of two atp's being produced directly by glycolysis. And then you also have, you also have the reduction of NAD to nadh. Remember reduction is all about gaining electrons and over here NAD, that's nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. We have other videos on that. It's a, it's an interesting molecule is actually a fairly decent sized molecule. We see this positive charge, but then we see that not only does it get  a hydrogen, but it loses, its positive charge. So it gains a hydrogen and an electron, you could think on a net basis. It's gaining a hydride. It's gaining a hydride. Now, a hydride anions not going to typically be all by itself. But on a net basis you can think about that's what's happening. And so it's gaining a hydrogen and an extra electron. And so this the NAD plus this is going to get reduced that is going to get reduced to nadh.  So this is getting reduced to nadh and that nadh, once it's, it can then be oxidized in the electron transport chain will study that later on when we think about oxidative, phosphorylation to produce even more atp's. But on a very high level simple basis glucose being broken down into pyruvate, six, carbons, three carbons, each of these pyruvate is now, there's other things attached to the carbons. Will see that in a little bit, two, atps net.  It and you have the reduction of NAD to nadh. He's 22, nadhs, and those can be used later on to produce more ATP s. Now, glycolysis is typically just the beginning of cellular respiration. If oxygen is around, then you have these products. Some of these products moving into the mitochondria, where you can have the citric acid, cycle, Krebs cycle and the oxidative phosphorylation occur, if you don't have oxygen around,  And then you're going to do anaerobic respiration, or you're going to go into fermentation, will talk about that in a future video. And that's really about figuring out what to do with these products and especially replenishing your nad+. Now, that we have a very high level overview of like glycolysis. Let's get a better appreciation for exactly what's going on. And whenever I look at these more detailed more detailed processes. The one thing to just appreciate is is how much complexity is  Is occurring in in all of your cells right now, this is this isn't some just well, it is fairly abstract. You just even imagine these things. But this is happening throughout your body. Gazillions of times right now. This isn't something that somehow distant from you, and it's also fun to appreciate, well, how all of this was discovered by scientists. It's that's a whole other fascinating discussion. But the whole point of this video is just give us an appreciation for the actual mechanism, or the, or the reaction, by which it occurs. I'm not going to go into the detailed organic chemistry.  Mechanism. So over here. This is a glucose molecule over here. You see one, two, three, four, five, six, carbons, and then the first step is it gets phosphorylated and we have a whole video on the phosphorylation of glucose and all of these steps are facilitated with enzymes. The phosphorylation is facilitated with the heck. So kinase kinase is a general term for an enzyme that either facilitates phosphorylation or dephosphorylate or dephosphorylates. It's it's dealing with  I guess you can say and all enzymes are all about lowering the activation energy. And the way that hexokinase is due or part of how they do it is, they involve the cofactor magnesium ion, and we've talked about that in other videos. How Co factors can help an enzyme lower the activation energy and to do the phosphorylation. We use an ATP. So this is minus 1, minus 1 ATP. So we are in the investment phase. We are in the investment phase right over here, but this reaction is  Strongly goes from left to right. It's a coupled reaction that taking that phosphorylating, the glucose that that requires free energy. But the ATP releases free energy, you coupled is reactions. That strongly goes from left to right now. What and just to be clear, what happened this this over here got replaced, or maybe I should say this over here, got replaced with that over there just to keep track of what's Happening Now.  Another enzyme catalyzed reaction. This one is actually an equilibrium. It can go both ways. But as we'll see the right side or the things that are further into the glycolysis process. These are constantly being turned into further products. So their concentrations are going to go down. And so the reaction is will tend to go that way. Although this, this particular reaction going from glucose 6-phosphate to fructose. 6-phosphate. This could be an equilibrium, but the enzyme that facilitates this phosphoglucose isomerase.  Summer. I so, Maurice, isomerases. These are enzymes that help grow from one. Isomer of a molecule to another isomer. And that's what's happening here instead of this oxygen being bound to this carbon. This bond forms with this carbon. And so you have fructose. You have the five carbon ring over here, or you have the Five Element ring. You have four carbons in it versus a Sixth Element ring. We're right over here. You have five carbons. So this Bond goes to this carbon right over here, and that's the main difference. And then you have another  Very strong forward reaction. Once again, facilitated by ATP and this is done by phosphofructokinase. It says the word kinase in it and it's using up the ATP. You can guess. What's going to happen. We're going to attach another phosphate group to the fructose 6. Phosphate and now you have two of these phosphate groups. So. So this, this hydrogen right over here, is now replaced with another with another phosphate group. And once again, it's  facilitated by the magnesium cofactor and help stabilize some of the negative charge associated with the phosphate groups. We talked about that in other videos, but the important thing is it uses another ATP. We're still in the investment phase - 1 - 1 ATP. And every time I look at just fasting that all of this stuff is happening in your cells as we speak. In fact, in order for me to speak this, has to happen because my body needs to take glucose, and come up with some energy to turn two atp's. So that I'm, I,  Old can actually move. And I can actually inhale, and exhale and all the things I need to do first Beach. So, appreciate, what's going on over here. Now, the next step we talked about the whole prophecy. The whole process of glycolysis is licensing. Glucose, and over here. This is a, this is derived from glucose and some phosphate and the next step were actually going to break it up and we're going to break it up using the enzyme fructose biphosphate. Aldolase aldolase enzymes, a full facilitate the aldol reaction this. In this one, we're going to actually  The aldol reaction could be to merge two to put together. Two molecules or in this case. We're going to break them up and we break them up into two three carbon chains. Now these two three carbon chains, glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate and this character right over here. They can be converted between the two with another isomerase. This triose phosphate isomerase right over here. So this point in glycolysis, we can think of ourselves as really having two of these. So let's say two times.  Three phosphate. So as we go further on, just imagining this happening twice for every glucose molecule. And at anytime you get confused. I encourage you to pause the video and see how these pieces and these pieces put together can form that over there. So now we have another reaction. It's facilitated by a dehyde dehydrogenase dehydrogenases usually are involved. In this case. This is this is this is the reduction of NAD. We saw that in the overview video. So NAD is  Is being is being reduced and this can be used this nadh later on can be used in the electron transport chain to potentially produce some more ATP. But in that process in that process, we also add another phosphate group to the glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate. So you see this phosphate group. You see this phosphate group right over here. That wasn't that wasn't here. That wasn't there before that wasn't there before. And actually this right over here is  Should I should I should have arrows on both sides this right over here that reaction could actually go both directions. Actually that reaction can as well and then and then we are now going to be in the payoff phase. So this right over here, we're starting with this molecule. That has these two phosphate groups. And then using the phosphoglycerate kinase, we're able to pop one of those. Phosphate groups off and in the process produce ATP.  We produce ATP. Now, we might want to say plus 1 ATP, but we have to remember this is now happening twice because we had two of those glyceraldehyde 3 phosphates. So now we could say, if we're talking about this happening twice, two plus, two atp's. We are now in the payoff phase, then you have facilitated by the phosphoglycerate mutase. A mutase is a class of isomerases have trouble saying that that will take a functional group from one place to another, or take one part of a molecule to another part. And you see this  Phosphate group. You see this phosphate group moving on from this carbon to the middle carbon. And so that's what that's doing. Then we use an in a lace to get over here. And then the pyruvate kinase, the pyruvate kinase and here, the kinase is going to be used to dephosphorylate. This molecule right over here, and it gets us to the way I've drawn it, as pyruvic acid. Since I've drawn, I have the hydrogen here and if the hydrogen is let go and this oxygen Hogs, the electron we would call.  All this pyruvate and this is considered to be the end of. I guess, you could say mainstream glycolysis, but what happened? And and and I don't want to glaze over what happened over here. This ADP got converted to another ATP, but it's going to happen twice. So this is another plus 280 PS. So hopefully you see the investment phase. We use an ATP right over here to phosphorylate the glucose. We use another ATP right over here to throw that second.  Speak group on the what was this? The fructose-6-phosphate. But then we get the payoff phase. So, we're able to produce this nadh and this is actually going to be two nadhs because everything here is going to happen twice. Now, we can assume that this character over here also gets gets converted to a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and now we produce two atp's because this is happening twice and we produce two atp's right over there. So hopefully everything we talked about in the beginning, everything we talked about the many actually makes sense.  Yes.\",\n",

No BS answers to your bodybuilding and fitness questions. Today's question is on the issue of the glycemic index and whether or not it is a useful tool when it comes to selecting carbohydrates for your muscle building or your fat burning diet. So for those of you who don't know what the glycemic index is. It's basically a chart which ranks carbohydrates from 0 to 100 based on. How quickly they raise blood glucose levels after they are consumed. And a lot of people will go with the idea that they need to consume quote-unquote low, glycemic carbohydrates because these carbohydrates are going to going to be broken down in a more gradual Pace. Provide you with more steady energy and are less likely to be stored as body fat. The fundamental problem with the glycemic index, is that the rankings that are assigned to each carbohydrate are based on the effects that those carbohydrates.  It's have when they are consumed alone in a fasted State. Now, you almost never consume your carbohydrates alone in a fasted State. You almost always combine them with proteins and fats and when you do combine them with proteins or fats, for example, you take a white potato, which does have a fairly high glycemic index ranking and you combine it with a steak and, you know, some some vegetables, the entire glycemic response of that meal is going to be lowered significantly, so there's no  Way for you to even know what the specific blood glucose response will be for specific carbohydrates as part of a complete meal just by looking at the glycemic index alone, choosing carbohydrates for your bodybuilding, diet is actually extremely straightforward. All I would really recommend that you focus on is on getting the bulk of your carbohydrates, from higher, fiber minimally, refined sources. So somewhere around 70 80, 90 percent of your diet, should be  be coming from those types of carbohydrates. So we're talking about things like oatmeal, you know, sweet potatoes, whole grains fruits, vegetables. These types of carbohydrates are going to be higher in fiber, more micronutrient dense. And as long as you're getting the bulk of your diet from those types of carbs, there's really no need to analyze it any further. Worrying about specific, glycemic index ranking. So low glycemic or high glycemic or the specific absorption rate of your carbohydrates. It's really just a total non-issue, so,  Gimmick index is essentially a useless tool when it comes to selecting carbohydrates for your diet. Just focus on getting the bulk of those carbs from high-fiber minimally refined sources. If you're doing that, you can also get a smaller amount from so-called cheat Foods as long as you're tracking it as part of your overall macronutrient intake, but that's really all you need to worry about.

According to some historians, the common use of this led additive caused widespread infertility and dementia in ancient Rome, especially among the ruling class. So, think about that next time you're wondering whether Aspartame is bad for you. The Romans wanted sweeter wines so bad. They put lead in it. Let us  Used in paint for thousands of years as well. And it's so useful that we kept using it through the late 20th century. Well, after we understood its dangers in particular, LED carbonate. Otherwise, known as white lead was widely used because it made paint. So opaque that a small amount of lead based paint can cover a large area.

In addition to its uses as a wine sweetener and a paint improver, LED offered even more benefits as a gasoline additive in the form of a compound known as tetraethyl lead. And the early 1920s car makers were looking for a solution to engine. Knock the engines work best when the fuel in the cylinder Burns all at once, and at the exact moment, the spark plug fires, but sometimes especially in older cars or with cheaper fuel. The fuel would actually ignite before the spark plug fired damaging the Pistons and cylinders in the engine and  Making an audible pinging noise, the tetraethyl lead, increased the ignition temperature, the gasoline eliminating pre-ignition. But of course the lead was released in the cars exhaust which was then inhaled by people and absorbed into their bloodstream as with paint. It took a while for the problems associated with leaded gas to show up. But some Clues came early, like the fact that workers who handled tetraethyl lead often experienced hallucinations and many of them died at a young age. So in 1974, the Environmental Protection Agency developed guidelines for eventually eliminating leaded gasoline it.

But once you hit around, 8590 you cancer, risk starts to drop. Kind of, makes sense. I mean, if you didn't get it by, then maybe you're never going to get it. If you live that long. Maybe it's a sign. There's something special about you seems that centenarians are endowed with a particular resistance to cancer. So what's their secret? Well, every day, 50 billion of ourselves die. And every day, 50 billion, new ones are born. There's a balance. Otherwise our body would atrophy shrink, or get too big and crowded. Now, sometimes we need to grow like when we're a baby or that growth spurt around puberty right ourselves. Don't get larger. When we grow up. They get more numerous, you know, child's hand may only be made up about 50 billion cells and may have to add a half trillion or so growing.  Going up once we've already grown up. We don't want a lot of extra cells hanging around and we still need our cells to grow and divide right out with the old in, with the new. We just don't want to be making more cells than we're putting out to pasture when your kid extra growth. That's good. But when you're an adult extra growth, can mean a tumor, how do ourselves know when to tip the balance in favor of more dividing and less dying? And when to come back into balance? Lucky signal is igf-1 a growth hormone called.  Like growth factor number one levels, go up when you're a kid. So you grow and then come back down. Should you level stay a bit too high as natl do, there's this constant message to ourselves, you know, grow grow, grow divide. Don't die, keep going, keep growing and so not surprisingly. The more igf-1 we have in our bloodstream, the higher our risk for cancer more, igf-1 more prostate cancer, more igf-1, more breast cancer.  Of course, it's not the original tumor that tends to kill you. It's the metastasis igf-1 is a growth factor. It helps things grow. So it helps cancer cells break off from the main tumor migrate into surrounding tissues and invade the bloodstream. You know, what do you think helps you breast cancer?

       " 'zUj-UTvZDk': \"Last video, we talked about the functions of cortisol and aldosterone, as well as how a lack of these corticosteroids cause Addison's disease. What happens though, when there is instead too much cortisol. Join me in this episode of Medicare Rio, where we will discuss Cushing syndrome the counterpart of Addison's disease.  There are two types of Cushing syndrome depending on whether the excess cortisol is from inside or outside. The body. Unlike Addison's disease aldosterone is not involved.  Endogenous Cushing's syndrome. The body itself is producing too much cortisol.  Recall from the previous video how the body regulates cortisol production in the adrenal glands. When the hypothalamus releases crh, in times of stress the anterior pituitary releases ACTH and response which stimulates the adrenal glands to release cortisol, the released cortisol, then stops the anterior pituitary and hypothalamus from releasing their hormones, which then stops cortisol production.  Clearly there is a feedback mechanism to prevent non-stop cortisol release. So why does it occur in Cushing syndrome? Well, if there is a tumor in the anterior, pituitary more cells are producing ACTH which stimulates more cortisol, release what's more. These anterior. Pituitary? Tumors are unresponsive to cortisol and continue to produce ACTH. Despite cortisol being released eliminating the feedback mechanism.  When endogenous Cushing's syndrome is due to an anterior pituitary tumor. It is known as Cushing's disease.  The tumors in the hypothalamus and the adrenal glands can also lead to high. Cortisol levels either due to high crh or high cortisol. Cushing's disease is the most common form of endogenous Cushing's syndrome. However, all of these tumors are rare with around 1. In 1 million people suffering from endogenous Cushing's syndrome with more women than men affected.  Let's look at the other type of Cushing syndrome. In exogenous, Cushing syndrome medication is the source of excess cortisol. Corticosteroid medication is not only used to treat Addison's disease, but also immune system diseases, such as asthma arthritis, gout and other autoimmune diseases.  This is because aside from energy production, cortisol also has the function of suppressing, the immune system, which can treat these autoimmune diseases, where the immune system is out of control. However, too much corticosteroid medication can over inhibit the body's natural defenses and result. In one of the symptoms of Cushing syndrome increased risk of infections.  The incidence of exogenous Cushing syndrome varies depending on the incidence of the disease. Has the medication is treating but it is more commonly seen than endogenous Cushing's syndrome.  In addition to being more susceptible to infections Cushing's syndrome, has many other symptoms weight, gain bone, weakness and high blood pressure.  Recall the other function of cortisol in our body discussed in the previous video. When released in stressful situations, it stimulates energy production so that you have enough energy to fight or run away. What happens though, after that stress is gone cortisol increases appetite so that you eat more food to replenish the energy stores that were used up. Most of us have experienced this increased appetite during or after a stressful situation colloquially known as stress.  Eating however, sustained increased levels of cortisol from Cushing syndrome caused stress eating in the absence of a stressful situation. Therefore, since the energy stores were never used up increased appetite and eating causes rapid weight, gain on the face neck and stomach. Not only can this rapid weight gain result in stretch marks on the belly called striae, when the blood vessels near the skin stretch and burst. It can also lead to diabetes which can eventually cause  is deaf.  Another function of cortisol is bone breakdown, which is why another symptom of Cushing syndrome is osteoporosis, or weak bones.  Bones aside from providing structural Support. Also act as storage for calcium.  Calcium ions are extremely important because they allow muscles to contract. Therefore, in times of stress, when cortisol is secreted, calcium is released from bone. So that the muscles can contract to fight or run.  Normally, this calcium is replenished when the stressful situation ends. But if cortisol is continuously released such as in Cushing syndrome, bones will constantly release their calcium and become weaker, and weaker resulting in osteoporosis.  Finally, many with Cushing's syndrome, suffer from high blood pressure. This is, because cortisol and aldosterone are very similar in structure. When cortisol is at extremely high levels as seen in Cushing syndrome. It can also stimulate aldosterone receptors in the cell to cause effects similar to those of aldosterone.  Since aldosterone increases blood pressure, high blood pressure is a common symptom of Cushing's syndrome. In addition, cortisol itself has a property of causing blood vessels to squeeze and get narrower which further increases blood pressure, high blood pressure will damage the heart, blood vessels, brain and kidneys, all of, which can lead to premature death. The main method of treating both exogenous and endogenous Cushing's syndrome is to decrease cortisol.  Levels. Treating exogenous Cushing syndrome is quite simple. Decrease, the dose of the corticosteroid medications or perhaps discontinued it all together, and look for an alternative treatment for whatever disease. The medication was treating one thing to watch out for when discontinuing corticosteroid treatment is to avoid suddenly stopping the medication.  Recall that cortisol either produced by the body or for medication inhibits. ACTH release. This is a natural response to prevent too much cortisol production.  However, because there is very little ACTH released by the adrenal glands are rarely stimulated and waste away from disuse. If medication is suddenly stopped in, ACTH begins to be released again, the adrenal glands are often so wasted away that they cannot produce cortisol leading to an at Estonian crisis. Therefore, it is important to slowly decrease cortisol medication and allow time for the adrenal glands to recover.  On the other hand, treating endogenous Cushing's syndrome such as Cushing's disease is more difficult by surgically removing the tumors. For example on the anterior pituitary. Excessive ACTH is no longer produced resulting in normal. Cortisol levels. If the tumor is too large, the entire anterior, pituitary may have to be removed resulting in the body now. No longer producing any ACTH. And as a consequence, no cortisol.  Therefore, the patient must be supplemented with cortisol to prevent Addison's disease.  Cushing syndrome and Addison's disease are both opposite and intertwine with each other. Treating one of them may lead to the other. If not done correctly, since in most of the cases Cushing's syndrome is due to excess steroid medications. This disease also teaches us a valuable lesson, follow instructions. Carefully when taking medication and contact your doctor immediately, if you are experiencing side effects,  thanks for watching and see you next time for another explanation of a disease on Medicare Rio.\",\n",

It is estimated that about forty eight thousand, nine hundred sixty people will be diagnosed with pancreatic. Cancer in 2015. It accounts for about three percent of all cancers in the United States, but seven percent of cancer deaths. Pancreatic cancer begins in the tissues of your pancreas, a pear-shaped. Organ located behind the lower part of your stomach. Pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect early and it typically spreads rapidly affecting other parts of the body. This is why it is called a silent disease. Here are the top six early warning signs of pancreatic cancer that you must know.  One point jaundice. It is common for people with pancreatic cancer to experience jaundice, characterized by yellowing of the eyes or skin. Jaundice can also cause itchiness on the hands and feet, especially the palms and Soles any size of tumor located in the head of the pancreas can lead to irregular bowel a yellowish Brown. Fluid released by your liver to Aid digestion. Flowing from the gallbladder into the small intestine. This causes excess buildup of bilirubin in the blood.  Of the main causes of jaundice. If you have signs of jaundice consult your doctor as it is, a common symptom of many liver and gallbladder diseases, as well as a sign of pancreatic cancer. If other causes are rolled out, ask your doctor about testing for pancreatic cancer to abdominal and lower back, pain abdominal as well as back. Pain are also common symptoms in patients with pancreatic cancer. Usually, the sharp pain is felt in the upper abdomen, which gradually  Julie radiates toward the back. Many patients also report, the pain is more severe at night and that they get slight relief from the Pain by bending forward. A 2001 study, published in a pancreas Journal found that abdominal pain and pancreatic cancer patients can be due to the increasing size of the tumor invasion of the intra pancreatic nerves invasion of the anterior pancreatic capsule and lymph node metastasis. If you are experiencing persistent mild to moderate abdominal pain consult.  Dr. Most cases of pancreatic cancer are diagnosed in patients, visiting the emergency room complaining of severe abdominal pain. In fact, the location of the pain is helpful in determining, where tumor is located three, nausea and vomiting nausea followed by vomiting is another sign of pancreatic cancer as the tumor grows. It can block some portions of the digestive tract which a the overall digestion process along with nausea.  A' and vomiting. You may also experience heartburn and acid reflux as any kind of interference with normal, digestion, and excretion processes can cause vomiting all nausea and vomiting episodes are not necessarily linked with cancer. Try peppermint or ginger tea, as well as limiting your water intake with meals, but drink water between meals to reduce nausea. If these symptoms tend to worsen after eating, and it is becoming difficult for you to eat anything without throwing up. Consult your doctor.  In advanced cases of pancreatic cancer surgery may be required to bypass the blockage and improve digestion for unexplained weight loss. Unexplained weight loss is another noticeable warning, sign of different types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer weight loss often occurs. When a tumor Sprint's to nearby organs and impairs their functioning. This affects proper digestion of nutrients and also leads to poor appetite. Also,  Due to lack of pancreatic enzymes aiding digestion, dietary fat start passing through the body undigested, which in turn causes weight loss. Furthermore, the cancer cells compete with healthy cells for nutrients. If you have started losing weight suddenly without making, any changes to your diet or physical activity, consult your doctor five greasy or light-colored stool stools of people suffering from pancreatic cancer have some distinct characteristics. The  May become large pale, oily floating, and smelly, as the growing tumor prevents the pancreas from releasing its digestive enzymes. These enzymes are needed to digest food, especially fatty food. The undigested. Fact, ultimately ends up in your stool, making it float or look Rishi. These fatty stools are difficult to flush away. Furthermore, stools, turn a lighter color. Due to the lack of bilirubin as the color and consistency of your stool, says a lot about.

You may also notice changes in your urine color, despite drinking enough fluid throughout the day, your urine may become darker and take on an orange Amber or brown shade, a growing pancreatic tumor can cause bile to get blocked and not released from your body in the way that it should be, too much bilirubin in the body can get into your urine and make it.  In appearance at times, there also may be traces of blood in your urine. If you notice that your urine has become darker in color without any dietary explanation.

Use alpha-glucosidase, Inhibitors are used to establish greater glycemic control over hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus type 2.  Two particularly with regard to postprandial hyperglycemia. They may be used as monotherapy in conjunction with an appropriate diabetic diet and exercise or they may be used in conjunction with other anti-diabetic drugs alpha-glucosidase Inhibitors, may also be useful in patients with diabetes, mellitus type 1. However, this use has not been officially approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Mechanism of action alpha-glucosidase Inhibitors are  The rides that act as competitive Inhibitors of enzymes needed to digest carbohydrates specifically alpha-glucosidase enzymes, in the brush border of the small intestines. The membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidase is hydrolyzed, oligosaccharides trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose, and other monosaccharides in the small intestine acarbose. Also blocks pancreatic alpha-amylase. In addition to inhibiting, membrane-bound alpha-glucosidase has  Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the Lumen of the small intestine inhibition of these enzyme. Systems reduces the rate of digestion of carbohydrates less glucose is absorbed because the carbohydrates are not broken down into glucose molecules in diabetic patients, the short term effect of these drugs therapies is to decrease current blood glucose levels. The long-term effect is a small reduction in hemoglobin A1c.  Level dosing, since alpha-glucosidase Inhibitors are competitive Inhibitors of the digestive enzymes. They must be taken at the start of main meals to have maximal effect their effects on blood sugar levels, following meals will depend on the amount of complex carbohydrates in the meal, side effects and precautions since alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, prevent the degradation of complex carbohydrates into glucose. The carbohydrates will remain in the intestine in the  colon bacteria will digest the complex carbohydrates. Thereby causing gastrointestinal side effects such as flatulence and diarrhea. Since these effects are dose-related. It is generally advised to start with a low dose and gradually increase the dose to the desired amount pneumatosis. Sisto hits intestinalis, is another reported side effect. If a patient using an alpha-glucosidase Inhibitors suffers from an episode of hypoglycemia, the patient should eat something.  Containing monosaccharides such as glucose tablets since the drug will prevent the digestion of polysaccharides. Non monosaccharide Foods. May not effectively, reverse.

       " 'bBZXkNbpOGQ': 'This video will teach you how to inject your insulin using a syringe.  Please watch the entire video before injecting your insulin.  Your healthcare provider May recommend that you inject insulin using a syringe to help you control your blood sugar level injecting, insulin with a syringe involves choosing an injection site, preparing the syringe and insulin and then injecting the insulin into your body.  Your healthcare provider will tell you what type of insulin you need as well as when and how much you need to inject.  You will need alcohol, wipes, your bottle of insulin.  A new syringe for each injection.  And a Sharps disposal container to throw away. The used syringes.  A disposable syringe has the following parts a barrel.  A plunger.  A needle cap.  And a needle, selecting the injection site.  Before injecting your insulin select the injection site on your body, the areas for insulin injection, include the abdomen, or belly upper arms, the thighs, and the buttocks. When selecting the injection site, be sure you use a different spot. Each time. You give yourself an injection.  Leave at least one inch away from the last injection spot.  Inject your insulin at least 2 inches from your belly button.  And choose a spot. One inch or farther away from any SCAR or mole.  Preparing the syringe and Insulin Step 1, wash your hands with soap and water and then dry them.  Step 2. If your insulin needs to be mixed gently, roll the bottle between your hands. Do not shake the bottle because it may cause bubbles to form in your insulin.  Before injecting yourself, check the insulin in the bottle to make sure it is the type of insulin, your doctor prescribed for you.  Not past the expiration date.  And the insulin is free of clumps.  Step 3, remove the cap from your insulin bottle. Use an alcohol wipe to clean the rubber stopper, on the top of the bottle.  Step 4, remove the syringe from its package. Be sure to use a new syringe each time you inject insulin.  Step 5, remove the needle cap from the syringe.  Do not touch the needle or allow it to touch any surface and do not use the syringe. If the needle is bent, some syringes have a cap over the plunger that you may need to remove as well.  Step 6, pull back the plunger to draw in an amount of air that is equal to your insulin dose.  Step 7. Hold your insulin bottle securely on a flat surface. Push the needle, through the rubber, on the top of the bottle, push the plunger to inject the air into the insulin bottle.  Leave the needle in the bottle, this helps to keep the right amount of pressure in the bottle and makes it easier to draw insulin into the syringe.  Step 8 with the needle. Still in the bottle, turn the bottle and syringe upside down.  Step 9, pull back the plunger to fill the syringe with just a little more than the insulin dose you need. If you see air bubbles tap, the barrel of the syringe with your finger, to make them rise to the top slowly push in the plunger, just enough to push out the air and extra insulin.  Step 10 carefully. Check to make sure the amount of insulin in the syringe matches your insulin dose.  Pull the needle out of the bottle and carefully. Lay the syringe on a flat clean surface.  Make sure the needle does not touch anything.  Injecting the insulin.  Step 1, clean your injection, site with an alcohol wipe, use a circular motion to clean. A spot about 2 inches wide. Step to pinch. A two inch fold of skin in the cleaned injection spot. Step 3, hold the syringe, like a pencil and quickly. Insert the needle straight into your skin at a 90 degree angle. Make sure the whole needle, enters your skin.  Step 4. Push the plunger all the way down to inject the insulin into the fat tissue beneath your skin, slowly count to five. Before, removing the needle, to make sure you have injected, all of the insulin step 5, pull the needle, straight out to remove it.

       " 'CSdVZtWOaM': \"Our to transport glucose into cells which either use of glucose for energy or store it throughout the day. The body is constantly making slight adjustments to keep blood glucose levels at an optimal range. These slight adjustments are controlled by the hormones, insulin and glucagon. But in this video, we'll focus on insulin. Insulin is released into the bloodstream. When blood glucose is high such as after a meal.  It signals to cells to take in glucose for energy or storage, and it also prevents more glucose from being synthesized or released from Storage. Therefore, the overall effect of insulin is to decrease blood glucose levels.  Diabetes mellitus or simply diabetes occurs. When this insulin signaling pathway is broken without proper functioning of insulin. Blood glucose levels Skyrocket. Despite glucose being a very important source of fuel for the body too much of it in the blood is extremely damaging in the short term, high blood glucose leads to the Hallmark, symptom of diabetes glucose Syria or glucose in the urine.  In fact, the term mellitus means, honey in Latin to reflect this symptom of sweet tasting urine. How does this occur?  At the kidneys glucose is filtered out of the blood and into the urine, but is later transported back into the blood. Since the body does not want to lose this valuable source of fuel.  This reabsorption uses proteins which have a maximum rate of transport.  When there is too much glucose in the blood, more of it is filtered into the urine, even at their maximum transport rate, the proteins cannot transport all of the glucose out of the urine. Leading to glucose area. This causes excess urination since the presence of glucose in the urine draws in more water by osmosis, excess. Thirst and dehydration are a consequence of this since more water is lost through urine.  In addition, since cells cannot take up glucose for energy without insulin, the body perceives itself to be starving leading to both increased appetite and fatigue.  In the long-term high blood glucose damages. Blood vessels in the eyes and kidneys, which is why diabetes is the leading cause of adult blindness and kidney failure.  High blood glucose. Also damages nerves leading to loss of sensation in the feet and hands when those areas get injured such as from Cuts or from blood vessel damage. The person does not notice the injury leading to infections and the crosses that eventually require amputation, most importantly the damage to blood vessels in the heart and brain can lead to high blood pressure stroke and heart attacks which account for most of the deaths in diabetic patients.  Most diabetes cases can be divided into two types based on how the insulin signaling pathway is malfunctioning type 1 diabetes accounts for around ten percent of diabetes cases while type 2 makes up most of the remainder.  The last few percentage points are attributed to rarer forms of diabetes that you can check out in the video description.  Type 1 diabetes is caused by a lack of insulin production in the pancreas. There are special clusters of Endocrine cells called the islets of langerhans. One type of endocrine cell in these eyelids is the beta cell which produce and release insulin in type 1 diabetes. The beta cells are destroyed by the immune system. Therefore the body can no longer produce insulin and blood glucose levels, rise. Uncontrollably leading to the symptoms mentioned earlier.  Scientists believe both genetic mutations and environmental factors such as infections, may play a role in triggering this autoimmune attack.  An additional symptom of type 1. Diabetes is rapid weight loss as fat cells or adipocytes. Begin to break down fats into another type of energy molecule known as Ketone bodies.  Large amounts of. These Ketone bodies are released into the blood, which can be taken up by other cells as an alternative source of fuel. However, Ketone bodies are slightly acidic molecules. So excessive amounts of these molecules can acidify the blood. This is known as diabetic ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening condition if untreated  However, when most people think of diabetes, there are probably Imagining the more common type 2 diabetes associated with obesity, a high sugar and fat diet, and a lack of exercise. These three lifestyle factors as well as genetic factors dramatically, increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.  Unlike type 1, diabetics type 2 diabetics, continue to produce insulin. However, their cells have become resistant to insulin, meaning that more insulin is required to achieve the same effect of lowering blood glucose to compensate for insulins ineffectiveness beta cells, will produce even more insulin.  However, when insulin resistance becomes so severe that the insulin required by the body exceeds, the maximum amount of insulin produced by beta cells symptoms of high blood, glucose begin to appear weight loss and diabetic ketoacidosis from fat breakdown also occur. In some cases of type 2 diabetes.  Furthermore, in some cases, the continued overproduction takes a toll on the beta cells, which eventually die and causes a lack of insulin production further, worsening the problem.  The cause of insulin resistance is still not well, understood. However, factors such as high, insulin levels from excessive sugar consumption and fat around the liver and pancreas are being investigated as possible causes of insulin resistance.  It is important to note that it is very difficult to cure diabetes. As of now. Doctors are only able to make living with diabetes tolerable. As long as medications are taken and lifestyle changes occur. Current treatment depends on the type of Diabetes. Since the high blood glucose of type 1. Diabetes is caused by a lack of insulin. Simply administer insulin during periods of high blood glucose such as after a meal. However, this is easier said than done.  Insulin is a protein and we'll get degraded in the stomach if taken orally there for type, 1 diabetics. Must inject insulin directly into the bloodstream. Usually just under the skin of their abdomen.  The dose is also extremely important to little and blood glucose levels remain high. But too much insulin will cause a blood glucose levels to plummet leading to Coma or even death. On the other hand, decreasing high blood glucose in type 2. Diabetes is much more complicated. Insulin is only effective in around 30 percent of patients as cells are already insulin resistant. So other methods of decreasing blood glucose are required,  Many diabetic drugs have been developed, which Target the mechanisms of blood glucose regulation, mentioned in the beginning of this video.  These drugs can decrease glucose absorption in the intestines. After a meal, decrease synthesis of new glucose or increase insulin sensitivity, which leads to more glucose uptake by cells. For example, the drug metformin is the first line treatment type 2 diabetes because it can activate certain metabolic pathways to both decrease glucose synthesis and increase glucose uptake by cells by increasing insulin sensitivity.  However, despite our best efforts diabetes is the 6th leading cause of death worldwide with three people dying from diabetes. Complications every minute. Therefore. The best treatment of diabetes is to prevent diabetes from occurring in the first place though. No, prevention, method is known for type 1, diabetes frequent exercise and a healthy diet drastically. Reduces the risk of the much more common type 2 diabetes.  Currently, it is estimated that 400 million adults, which is around ten percent of the worldwide. Adult population is living with diabetes. Although, this number is expected to increase in the future. If more people become aware of and avoid the lifestyle choices, associated with diabetes, we can slow down or even reverse. This trend, furthermore type 2 diabetes in particular, develops slowly, and silently over time leading scientists to suspect that.  Almost half of the worldwide diabetic population is undiagnosed which is why it is so important to educate the public about the causes and symptoms of this disease.  It is also important to note that diabetes is an extremely complex and not fully understood disease. That scientists are still finding new information about every day.

       " 'F7N0LPdItk': \"You can do that on some other time, perhaps. So genetic was take that first one that  And of course, it matters. What genes we inherit? And that's what we thought about in terms of genetics for a long time as being important. But only a 15 percent of the genes in our cells are turned on at any given time. So something must be going on that for those other 85%, They're just hanging out waiting while waiting for what while waiting to be needed based on reaction to the environment? And doesn't that make sense that that humans have been so?  The ball over the years that there would be some number of genetic card. So to speak that we have in our hands and we can play depending upon the environmental need and the food too much food, hot climate cold climates on and on. We've been able to roll with the punches because we've had choices of genes that we could actually turn on or turn off.  Think about this epigenetics, which is this turning on and off these switches if you will, for the genes is that turning a gene on or off is not always a reversible thing. If it happens at Key developmental stages of life, such as we've been saying prenatal and early life and we actually know the body's on off switches. And on this slide here is a kind of a cartoon description of that and this is from a wonderful.  Going to England Journal from July of last year. And if you want to turn a gene on, this is what we do. That blue curly line is DNA and you can see that nothing in terms of Gene sequence, is being affected that blue line is not being affected in any way. In terms of no one's breaking it apart and searching other nucleotides in there. It stays just the same. But what is changing is those orange football like things?  There are called histones histones are proteins, that DNA winds around to kind of organize itself. If you take the DNA and anyone sell and stretch it out. It's about 6 feet long, just crammed that down to a little tiny cell nucleus. Obviously packaging is very important in terms of whether RNA can even get in there to transcribe that section of DNA if you want to open up an area of DNA. So that RNA can get in there, you put some acetyl groups on your histones. That's what  They see is up there. You also take a transcription Factor on that p.o. Box, which is your promoter area. These things will turn a gene on, so to speak, do I turn a gene off, you get rid of those acetyl groups on the histones, you get rid of the transcription factor and you think some methyl groups on the promoter area to kind of block that to the promoter area is sort of like the ultimate on/off switch for the genes. There are methyl groups. They're completely blocks other things, being able to get in there and that Gene is effectively turn.  Goff.  So epigenetics then helps us understand. We've known for a while that this idea of nature versus nurture, which, you know, the question has been asked which of those is more important, and we know, actually, that now, that's an absurd question. It's not either or is that they both of them interact with each other quite a bit. And as the strategy about to talk about Saint describes nurture effects nature of this study was done in rap rap, and if you take rat pups that are raised by now.  Three mothers. And if you're a rat, one of the ways you do that and do lick and groom your pops at a regular basis. And it's now been shown that literally the gene which affects stress hormone receptors gets turned on. If you in rats that are raised by good nurturing mothers and these rats grow up to be very stress resilience rats. They're pretty mellow the kind that if you put them in new cage, they might just go. Hey, this is kind of cool. I can look around and see what's going on here. Not stressed by it.  But rat pups that are raised by neglectful mother's the gene, which affects their stress. Hormone receptors is turned off these threats. Grow up to be very stressed, react, if you put that on ukj, will cower in the corner in fear and you might say, well how do we know that? They didn't just get this inherited? They've taken rat rat pups that were born to mothers that were nurturing and mothers that were neglectful and reversed them. So that they were actually raised by the  Other type of mother. Plus, they've actually been able to measure the DNA methylation on those genes to know, which of these have been turned on or off. So, as they say, there's no change in gene sequence. The changes are only in gene expression, hence. These kinds of effects are called epigenetic or above the genome. So to speak epigenetic mechanisms, provide, a potential pathway by which early experience can have lasting effects on behavior, and it's  Does Daniel goleman says it's biologically impossible for Gene to operate independently of its environment.

A  A scientist named shinya yamanaka, figured out how to force this reversion to stem cells in a lab using for specific proteins. Now, known as the yamanaka factors we can get these stem cells starting with a skin biopsy.

So we're going to start off the talk by let's talk about what's in Great Lakes fish. Why would we want to study fish and  We have to keep in mind when we're talking about contaminants, which we're going to talk a lot here, is that there's a lot of benefits from eating fish, and it's not just the nutrients, but it's also that there are cultural traditions and there's also recreational benefits of angling, and then we know there's a lot of health benefits.  It's and in particular. The research has focused on maternal consumption of fish and the increases in neurodevelopment and The Offspring. And as cardio protection for decreasing, coronary heart mortality in older adults.  Oh, this is some data that I analyzed in conjunction with the international joint commission and we had great lake trout and great lake Whitefish from several of the Great Lakes. And this is just total EPA and DHA milligrams per 100 grams of fish. And in comparison fatty marine fish. So this day I'm here.  Eddie marine fish was from the USDA databases and while it's not quite as high levels, I mean, there's still substantial levels of omega-3 fatty acids and fish. And actually since this work, the EPA has been doing quite a bit of work. Looking at a mega Three fatty acids in the same fish that they're monitoring the emerging persist, the emerging pollutants.  So let's talk about the emerging pollutants. There's and and the Legacy contaminant. So these are the contaminants. I'm going to focus on today. We've done a lot of work with pcbs and DDT, which you probably are all aware. Is the most persistent metabolites of D or DD e. We work with, which is the most persistent metabolites of DDT. We work with pbdes and pee.  For us. And we're going to talk about methyl Mercury. We actually haven't looked at that and the Great Lakes cohort. Unfortunately, but we are looking at it. Another studies.  So I probably don't have to do too much of an introduction on pcbs for you because I suspect, most everyone has a pretty good knowledge of some of the Legacy pollutants. Some of the one thing I did want to mention though is the toxicological properties of pcbs. So pcbs are 209 different Contours and then  They're very similar to dioxins and furans, which also have a number of congeners and the congeners have very different properties. And the one thing that the one measurement that's been very well known in the literature is the toxic equivalent. So, the, how how much dioxin like activities chemicals have, but not all pcbs, have dioxin like  At ease, they have a number of other activities and they can have osteogenic effects and antioxidants genetic effects, and the effects can be different based on what tissue and what age of person you're looking at. So so that's one thing to keep in mind. Just did that automatically.  The other thing is we have a lot of exposure from fish, just other animal products, is also a source of exposure, and that's kind of in contrast to Mercury where we get most of our exposure from fish. And then there's also the potential for PCB exposure from the indoor environment because we know it was used in a lot of products. So,  We can't really use just fish consumption as a metric for PCB exposure. We have to actually measure it because it can be coming from other sources.  And I think everyone's probably aware that has really long half. Some congeners have a very long, Half-Life in the body. Others are very non-persistent and they could be having health effects, but we really don't know because we don't generally see them. What we measure human, blood samples.  So this is some data from the state of the Great Lakes and the most recent one I could find was 2011. And these are PCB levels in the top predator fish, which is generally lake trout. I think it's walleye in Lake Erie is the top predator and you can see the general trend for decreasing levels. However, if you look at the axis,  the y-axis, you can see there's a big difference for some of the legs and that there's actually much higher levels in Lake Ontario of Lake Michigan. And that's really related to the industry in that area.  And the epa's assess the state of the Great Lakes, assessment Was Fear, status, basin-wide and improving levels, but it's also important to note that some of these levels are still high enough to trigger Sports fish consumption. Advisories DDE. The metabolite of DDT is something that is also measurable in Great Lakes fish.  It's and we also see associations of DDE levels with years of sports fish consumption and our cohort. I'll talk about that in a little bit and don't the say the Great Lakes didn't have additional data, but additional charts. So this is a little older term, but they're basin-wide status is good and improving.  So pbdes are chemicals. We began studying in about the mid tooth. I think 2004 2005 began measuring those. And at that point, we thought that we would see strong associations with fish consumption and our participants. We had to show you what we actually found in a little bit, but we do see that they worse. They they did increase in in Gray.  Likes fish through about the early 2000s, and then there was a voluntary phase-out of the penta pde product, which is what was used the most in foam, and so upholstered, chairs and carpeting pads, and all kinds of consumer applications. So, with the after the, well, actually, before the phase out, which  is interesting. We started to see Decline and levels in the fish or at least a leveling off of levels. There's also a whole lot more measurements in this timeframe was because people started really getting interested in these chemicals. So we think that probably more of our exposure is coming from dust indoors than it is from fish, but this could change as time goes on and more of  The Furnishings that are contaminated going to landfills and the chemicals, you have more just dispersed in the environment. Another chemical that I haven't worked with in the cohort, but that is of great interest to people I think is pfos the per floor and activate sulfate and this is some data from state of the Great Lakes and this is a slide.  I'd from Bernie crimmins at Clarkson who he wanted to me and he looked at P faucet lake trout and this is in Lake actor.\",\n",
       " 'qlMr1rUT8': \"So, the next Oregon, we're going to talk about in art or to abdomen is the pancreas, and I've drawn the pancreas right here. Let me just write that out. This is our pancreas, which I believe you may have heard about before the pancreas sits below and behind the stomach. And it kind of hugs. The first part of our small intestine here, which I think you may now recognize is called the duodenum. In fact, it wraps around a little more than what I've drawn right here, but just know that it's  It's back way back over here. In fact, some say that the pancreas sits in a completely separate compartment from our stomach, our small intestine, our large intestine. Even our liver. It's it's not in the peritoneum. The peritoneum is where the rest of our guts, it. The peritoneum is just a fancy word for the abdomen. So our stomachs, it's in our peritoneum, our liver sits in our peritoneum, the small  In the large intestine, all these guys sit in our peritoneum, but our pancreas is different because it sits in the retroperitoneum and when we say retroperitoneum, that means it sits in the back of the abdomen. Now, it's not there alone. A lot of our big vessels that run through the abdomen are also there, the abdominal aorta, the inferior vena cava these things, you may have heard of Elsewhere, but it sits in this very different compartment. And in fact to medical professionals, the pancreas is actually a  force to be reckoned with for a couple of reasons. First of all, it releases a bunch of powerful enzymes, powerful enzymes that we're going to talk about in a minute and these powerful enzymes can digest a whole bunch of our macromolecules things that we eat. But also the things that line our cell membranes or make up other parts of our body not just in the retroperitoneum, but in the peritoneum, the thorax everywhere else in our body, so it releases powerful enzymes and to the pancreas.  A little strange in that. It's unon capsulated on encapsulated, which is different from other organs. Like the liver. The liver has got the liver capsule. The kidney is covered by its own capsule, but the pancreas is essentially just a slurry of cells. That's hanging somehow in the retroperitoneum. And that makes it a little difficult especially for surgeons that have to operate nearby. You don't want to mess with the pancreas because it's got all these powerful enzymes that could cause a lot of damage around it.  They were released. No wonder then the pancreas has sort of earned itself, a special nickname. Many Physicians, consider the pancreas to be the lion of the abdomen because of how important it is and additionally how powerfully enzymes are that come from it. So just like the lion in The Jungle, you don't want to mess with the pancreas. So let's take a few minutes then and talk about what makes the pancreas. So special physiologically the pancreas releases to  Types of things or has two main components to it. One. There's the exocrine pancreas and the idea behind the exocrine pancreas is that it takes salts and write it down here. Enzymes. So these powerful enzymes I talked about earlier. It takes these salts and enzymes and releases them in the duodenum or the duodenum. And I think you remember where that is. That's the first part of the small intestine.  Right after the stomach. And so our exocrine pancreas has four main roles that it accomplishes. So firstly, as you may recall because the pancreas releases its contents into the duodenum. Think about what the duodenum is receiving right beforehand. Well as we talked about in the video on the stomach, we're getting a whole bunch of chyme that's been digested by gastric acid, or hydrochloric acid. And so we'll need something to neutralize all that acid. And  The exocrine pancreas release bicarbonate the bicarbonate here will serve to neutralize our gastric acid. So we will neutralize the pH or the very low PH that were receiving from the stomach and the form of gastric acid. And remember, again, the gastric acid is hydrochloric acid. Next, as we move on we'll talk about some of those powerful enzymes that we  Discussed earlier. One of them that we've briefly mentioned when we were talking about the mouth is amylase and if you recall amylase is responsible for the breakdown of starch. And if you remember starch is just a whole bunch of carbohydrates stacked upon one another and we break down starch into our smaller carbohydrates. So I'll just write smaller carbs for right now. So that will include things like those glucose monomers or even dice.  Grades, and then another enzyme that we also release from the exocrine pancreas into. The duodenum is something called lipase and lipase should be another throwback to the mouth because its name suggests that it breaks down lipids. So specifically, it'll take triglycerides, which I can draw here. So, here's a triglyceride right there.  And you've got these fatty acid chains that are coming off, the glycerol, head, it'll take triglycerides and it'll break them down into free fatty acids. And so those will look like this. So that's the acid part. And here's the fatty acid part as well as things like monoglycerides and monoglycerides look like this and we're calling them mono because they've only got  One fatty acid chain on them. We can also have diglycerides which I think you might be able to guess what these guys look like. If I draw them out, like here diglycerides are going to have two fatty acid chains on them. There you go. And then it also will release glycerol glycerol. Glycerol is what happens when you get rid of all your fatty acid chains. And so you'll have some of these guys and they're all OHS right here. So that's what you're like,  Tasteful doing it's similar to the lingual lipase that you had in your mouth. But in the mouth it was mainly for Taste, when you digested your triglyceride in the duodenum this enzyme Works to break down triglycerides in a greater Manner. And then finally, the last function of the exocrine pancreas involves, its proteolytic enzymes. I'll just write pro deo lytic right here and I'll expand. There are two types of proteolytic enzymes. There's trip.  It's in ojen, that it releases trypsinogen.  There's trypsinogen and there's also kymo. This is a longer word, kymo trypsinogen trypsinogen and I think there's a couple of light bulbs that should be coming on right now because whenever you see, the suffix, oh, Jen. As we see down here, that refers to something, that's called a zymogen, a zymogen, which means an enzyme that is  Active right now, because it has an extra Bond, usually a peptide bond, that needs to be broken in order for it to start doing its thing. So trypsinogen is the inactive form of trypsin. Just like how chymotrypsinogen is the inactive form of chymotrypsin and these guys need to be activated and the way that's done is in the duodenum. There's an enzyme that sits there called entero peptidase. There's a  whole bunch of entero peptidases that line the duodenum. Your entero peptidase will break down trypsinogen to form trypsin.  Trypsin is the active form, that's then going to be able to break down proteins. And what we're doing here is actually causing a chain reaction, because once trypsin is formed the next step in activating chymotrypsinogen is accomplished by trypsin. Trypsin Will cleave your chymotrypsinogen to form and this is a very long word. Kymo. Trypsin chymotrypsin, and these guys will go wreak  And break down proteins in the duodenum. Now, my question to you is these are enzymes and they're inactive because of usually a single Bond. What happens when that bond that makes them? Inactive breaks say if you're in a car accident and you get hit in the stomach and there's enough Force there that can provide activation energy to break a bond and turn trypsinogen into trypsin. What would happen?  Well, as we mentioned earlier, because the pancreas is an encapsulated activated, trypsin will go on to activate, chymotrypsinogen into chymotrypsin and then we'll break down proteins wherever they see them. And that can be membrane proteins. They could be proteins that are in the surface of the duodenum. They could be proteins that we digested in our food or they could be proteins that are present in the pancreas. So you can see why the pancreas is so feared and  It's why the pancreas is something you don't want to have damaged because we can activate these deadly enzymes. That should be working in the duodenum.\",\n",
       " 'v_0QWtqfVY': \"What's up done? That also work out. I feel great. I'm gonna be here today to motivate you getting through the whole workout. Okay, take it back into a nice job for me.

Now I want you to put one leg across the other and just stretch down. This is going to stretch out your glutes, to keep that chest up.  Each stretch for about 10 12 seconds.  And change over to the other leg breathe in and exhale, who, I'm super excited. We're going to get so pumped up, her body's gonna be looking amazing. Once I finish with you. Let's just work on our arms. So few circles that we go bring it forward and out to the side, just a few backwards.  Anticlockwise. And then forwards, chest up back, nice and straight wiggle has legs out. Let's get ready to go. First exercise. I'm down to the ground. I want you to get into a plank position. Your legs are going to be about hip width apart and we're going to grow up and down for 12. So you're going to really make sure that all the weight is on that left arm that you want.  Grace this I'll make it harder. You can use wait to engage those ab muscles. Make sure that you're nice and still no movement, four. Three, two one. Okay. The other side with him, just throw it up. Keep that spine. Nice neutral, but your head just slightly. Looks like in front of your hand.  And engage that core. Excellent. Start everyone, stay strong and down. Hope we go.  Three, two one. Okay, down to your stomach. We are going to put your legs a little bit further than hip-width apart. And we're just going to pull the legs up. We're going to squeeze and down. Everything is just going to be for 12 reps. So keeping ourselves motivated using all our body. We're going to be working our arms, our legs, our ABS, our booty, breathe.  Squeeze those glutes together and up, you go.  Guys, you can do this. You're gonna feel the burn. Five, four three squeeze even harder to make this last one count. One onto your side to come up into a side plank. The arm is going to be up in the air or we to really pull up using those oblique muscles. I just want you to bring your knee to your chest.  If you're finding this to challenging that all we have to do is just hold it here. I think you can push yourself. I think you can do this. In fact, I know you can do this. Even if you just managed to. Well, it's three each time you do it. You're going to get better and better. I started off, I couldn't even do this until I could even hold it for a second. And there you go. One more switch over to the other side. I'll become make sure you get yourself, nice and comfortable, and then,  Support first. And then just bring that knee to the chest pull these. Absolutely, these oblique muscles heal really working. Let nice slow and controlled. Make sure your posture is right and breathe. Come on, guys, we can do this. Do it together. That's it. Bring that knee in four, three, two, and give me one more and extend out.  Drop that bottom down or you to come up to standing.  Your leg is going to go out to the side. We're going to do one leg squat. So, where do using our glutes and the quads strengthen up those leg muscles? We're gonna go down the 12 now really focused. Something that's in front of you, that's going to help with your balance. So I'm going to, I'm staring at you. You guys just stare back at me and we've got this free. Good job, everyone.  By three to rebuild burn one straight over onto that other leg. And let's go down. Now, this workout we're gonna be doing is we're going to be doing one for our arms, one for legs 14, but one for each X is X each body part. And then we're going to move on and do it all over again. I'm also gonna give you a power one as well. So it's really going to increase your cardio.  Intensify the work out. Three to look at Build-A-Bear My Back. 10K, little Shake. Oh you go straight into it. We're going to do high skips. So 11:59 these see how high you can jump, get to me higher really spring off those feet. You gonna be improving the leg muscles. We're gonna be doing some pirate metrics. Give me one more.  Pulse install. Everybody has a fresh set out the way got seven of these to just give you a legs of shake. I'm gonna hydrate because number one, when you're working out is hydration. Obviously sweat loads. What does that sweat? Go just comes out of my body. We need to replenish it. So make sure you've got some hydration nearby and keep yourself going. Oh, ready for set.  Number two, come down to the grout will be doing narrow push-ups. So you can either do it with your knees on the ground, or you can come up to your toes. Your hands are going to be shoulder width apart. We're gonna go down and up, keep your chest up. We've just got 12. You can do this, wherever you need to come down to your knees, then you can or just give me. Give me three. Give me five. However, many you can do is to start. You just gonna really know.  Reese knows all muscles and you're gonna get better each time. Oh my gosh, you got this. Push yourself. See what your body can do. I know you can do it. That's it, guys. Come on. Just a few more over halfway 50.  Breathe, that's it. Two more two. And the last one get those elbows into your waist, feeling a billion, my triceps coming down. Always put your legs over to one side, doesn't matter which side, whichever one feels comfortable to start with. We are going to do side oblique crunches. So your hands are gonna be behind your head and we just want to squeeze up and really activate these obliques here, okay.  Sue got 12 on each side for you to come up as high as you can. And as you come up, you're going to Exhale because I'll tell you what talking from experience. If you don't breathe, when you're exercising, you stand up and you can become really dizzy. And that's why some people if they're not eating the right amount of food or the not eating the right food, and they may exercise, and they're not breathing. You're gonna feel a bit dizzy. I'm a bit sick, right?  Right. How the side genocide you started on. Go to the other one and up till I can feel it in my obliques really squeeze. Use the oblique muscles to bring you up. Don't use your hands for momentum. We've barely good. You better like your heart rate is up. Awesome job everyone. Let's keep it going for three.  To. Okay, squeeze that last one. And bring it up. I want you to come onto your front. So your hands are going to be underneath your shoulders. And we're going to extend one leg out at a time. That's going to be one rep and then going to change over to the other side. So just want you to follow your eyes with your hand, straining it out. So, keeping those abs tucked in pulled in, keep that leg nice and straight as you go to the back and extend that  Leg out, hold it, there her. Bring it in. Good job. Everyone. Keep it going. Extend, engage those abs. It's gonna be great, your balance as well. Squeezing, those glutes, as you come up to the top. Keep it going everyone. Let's give me four. Three, two, and one. Okay, we've warmed up those.  Glutes. Really come back over. We're going to push it even further. So I want you to extend your right leg up. Your arms are gonna be out to the side. I'm going to bridge, raise up and down. No, touching the ground. Okay, we're gonna make it really hard just come up and down nice and slowly. Squeeze those glutes as you get to the top. Come on, squeeze them harder. However hard, you're squeezing it right now. I want you to squeeze it 50 times harder and breathe.  Four, three, two, and one. Can you feel the burn? It switch it. Straight over to the other leg. Got a left leg up. We're gonna go up and down. No, really concentrate about using your abs and bringing your pelvis up to the ceiling. You can have your arms out to the sides, but don't use the floor to grip with. I just want you to really think about using your glutes. This is what's going to feel the burn. Should be feeling the Bern to really squeeze as you.  Get to the top.  Keep it going. Everyone just a few more 32 and your last one. And come down. Okay, your next power move a few jump. Okay. Now we're gonna do everyone's favorite.\",\n",

No portion, restriction. No calorie restriction and no exercise.  Tara and I are back with another very important study to go over with you guys. Tara went deep into the supplemental material to get some of the specifics. So I'm going to turn over to Tara and I'll be back a few weeks ago, a new weight loss study was published in the Journal of nutrition and diabetes. Titled the broad study. This was a randomized controlled trial, which is the gold standard in nutrition research. Participants were separated into two groups. One group got the standard protocol of  Okay, are the intervention group received education and support to adopt a whole food plant-based diet? And they were encouraged to do this without any calorie or portion restriction and no, mandated exercise. What did they eat unlimited amounts of unrefined, low-fat, plant foods, but no meat, no Dairy, and no oils. Here's what happened in the control group, as tends to happen with most people over the course of time, their  Ocean use increased, but you can see that in the intervention group over the course of the study, their medication used decreased by about 30%, the control group, lost a little weight about six pounds, over the six months of the study, but in the intervention group, you can see that they lost an average of 27 pounds over those first six months and you can also see that at the 12 month Mark, they had still kept that weight off. And again, this is not using any calorie restriction, or portion, restriction and know.  Mandated exercise, their cholesterol dropped to not surprisingly since they were eating no animal products which are the only dietary source of cholesterol, and it was a low-fat diet, but they went from starting average of about 208 down to 174 in just the first three months, and their LDL had dropped 35 points in that time. And now on to our favorite part diabetes, there were only seven people in this study who had diabetes all of  Whom had type 2 but all of them are reductions in their A1C value. When they were adherent to the diet protocol and about 30 percent were able to get off of their medications completely. Although the average A1C values reported for each group in the study, were based on the entire participant pool. They're still relevant and important to note at the start of the study in the intervention group. The average A1C value was 6.0 and, by the six-month Mark, they had dropped down to an average of five.  Point five, for those unfortunate enough to be placed in the control group. The Starting A 1 C value was 5.5., But by the end of the study, it was 5.7. So, in the intervention group for those with, or without diabetes, their A1C value went down over time, and in the control group, it did the opposite, it went up over time. So people in the intervention group of this study, reduce their  occation use lost weight lower, their cholesterol and reverse diabetes markers all while eating unlimited amounts of whole plant Foods, no portion, restriction. No calorie restriction, and no exercise. Now, to note for diabetes. Obviously, we recommend exercise because it's known to be very helpful in controlling your blood glucose. This study shows that even without exercise. You still can improve those numbers.  Is and get healthier in addition at the six-month, Mark, the intervention group compared with the control group noted that they had a higher self-esteem and better quality of life, but said that there was no real significant difference in cost or enjoyment of the food. The moral of the story, low-fat plant-based Whole Foods. That's how it's done.  Tara thank you for covering. All that. Give me a confirmation. My pleasure. The bottom line is my here here is, basically they got to eat as much as they want to do which is exactly. We do it, our Retreats exact. What we teach in our coaching program, you get to eat as much as you want. There's no limitations because there's so much water, so much fiber in these Foods. Only in specific cases. Do we need to make some tweaks of maybe the portion of the plate? Maybe it's a little more vegetables, little less of the carpet, but that gets into the calorie density or, you know, but it's not, you know, exactly that get some of the  This is what we do in our cultural practice working people, but the bottom line is, that's just the beauty of this approach. It truly is abundance. A large amount. No restricting this, a lifestyle. It's a long-term solution.

Stay over there by the okay. Come.  Oh, good girl. Well, I am back home with a worn-out and very content puppy. I am so grateful that I felt well enough to take her this morning because sometimes getting the dog park is a real struggle and it's just not feasible, but I only had minor symptom this morning. I was able to push through and let Harbor and some energy. And I'm going to continue with the Good Vibes. I have right now and do some filming for my gear video. So, I will see y'all after that. Jugs home. I like this new home for lunch thing. I know it's nice.  Last night a week. Yeah, and you're back to the usual. Yeah, even Harlow likes it. She's bringing you her favorite toy. She brings me her favorite toys smiling. So Jones, sterile gloves came in. This is a big hand. Yeah, his hands. Don't fit into the sterile gloves.

I was skeptical that sterile gloves would be provided outside of a sterile Port start kit by  But here they are. You want to change my needle? Today? I'm gonna finish this PB&J when you get back from work, it's needle changed a. Can you do it? Hmm? Sweet. Judd has seen me change my needle, plenty of times, but we decided he needs to do it more often because in times that I don't feel well enough to do it. I need somebody else to do it for me. So I'm not lazy. Shut up.  Have a good day, sir. Rest of the day. See you later people's. Hi. He's gone. Hippo.  You're a very happy dog. Today. I am doing my best to eat. Half a sandwich. Eat Cheetos, and a glass of juice. I think it's going well, but we'll see how my stomach feels about this. Anyways, Jeb's mom is coming into town this weekend for Mother's Day and some of y'all may or may not know in September. My dad had a stroke. Yes. It was scary, but he's doing so well with therapy and last month. He got his license back to start driving and he still can't do the drive from Orlando to Tampa Bay, so he hasn't been able to visit me.  What drugs mom is going to bring my dad with her this weekend? It's so awesome that our families, our friends because on stuff like this can happen. So Judds mom is going to stay with us. My dad's staying in a nearby hotel and I will be seeing my mom. She's gonna come next week and maybe the weekend after to see me to celebrate a late Mother's Day. So, all is good. I have some cleaning to do around the house and Jen and I have a busy day. We he needs to change my port needle when he gets home. So he gets more practice with it. We got to go to bravotv.com made for Harlow's road diet.  And we got to do our grocery shopping. So lots to do, got to get some stuff done, and I will see y'all, when Judd gets home. Judds home have got a D axis, which means take this needle out. So he can put a new one in. Got all the supplies here for him to do. So, and I actually ended up eating exactly half of my food, half of the half of the sandwich and forward my eat Cheetos. Unfortunately, could not keep it down. Gastroparesis problems ended up, you can get up in the downstairs bathroom, but kind of trying to find like a  Then all this, I ended up having to clean that bathroom. Anyways, so got my cleaning done, don't know. Anyways. Alright jobs, come downstairs, Harlow. She wants to stay with you. We actually don't let her around here when we're accessing my port. So, we got to make her lay by the front door. Yes. Judds got is sterile gloves on and they fit. Alright. I am going to set up the sterile field and we will see y'all after the needle change.  Successful needle change, Tada. Good job, babe. I didn't even feel it. Those, awesome. Very good man. No, no sitting here laughing because thinking of all the jobs Chun has, he's a soldier. He's a cop. He's my boyfriend. But he's also becoming a nurse. I mean, pretty much qualifies as a nurse of all the stuff you do for me right marce.  He's a good guy.

Help me conserve energy because we got to go to Walmart now. Actually, we're gonna drop this at home, put it in the freezer, then go to Walmart for groceries, made it to Walmart. When you're chronically. Oh, even the simplest things like grocery shopping can be really draining. So I'm hoping I want to spend too much energy here because Jen, and I have dinner, plans out usually always eat at home. But tonight we decided since we're so busy. We'll go out.  Enjoy something else.  I'm supposed to be vlogging but I'm tired, but we are getting barbecue later tonight. And I love barbecue. The place we go to. It's all over the State of Florida. It's called Mission Barbecue. It's amazing Mission. Barbecue is the best way to deal with the people of Walmart. It's pretty fun and check.  Perfect. Sweet. Thanks. Getting an egg.

This really big Josh not working out with the thing you put it in. So I'm really feeling the fatigue and the blood pooling from my pot, the longer.

Like Walmart while one I live in Florida, and there's a lot of elderly people here, so they're all  And being used and to it's important to exercise as much as you can with pot. Even though I was doing martial arts, six days a week and I was really active when I developed pots. I'm now extremely exercise intolerance because of my pots. So I'll like faint, instantly. When I try exercising, I can do some supine laying down exercises. Thanks to my infusions that I do now, but walking around Walmart, is the equivalent of my exercise. So that's why I don't use a motorized cards. I try and do what I can.  Can to stay active and right now for me, that's walking around Walmart. So that's why I don't use a motorized cart. Some days are worse than others. And I will use a cart if I need it or a wheelchair or a walker. But I try and walk when I can other people use the cards all the time and that's totally fine to you have to do, what's best for your chronic illness and how your chronic illness affects? You is not the same way it affect me and vice versa.  I'm really getting out of breath here. I need to take a break. And when you need a break, we take a break and that's totally. Okay, right hip? I think I finally found the answer to our Ice Cube problem. It's like half silicone half actual plastic, because that's awesome. And I'm really fading now, so I can't say much else about it, but I think this is going to work for Harlow's veggie pops. So I drop my medical ID bracelet and bending down to pick it up with  Exacerbate my pots symptoms of dizziness that I'm feeling right now and in extreme situations, it can even make me pass out. So I have a helpful service dog to help me out Harlow. Get it.  Give whoops. Got it. See this is how often I drop things. Good girl. Thank you. And as per usual, I've come to find a bench trial judge checked. Good girl and finish that off with the minor asthma attack because somebody was smoking outside of the store.  But I did it. We made it through Walmart. Now, we're good to drop the groceries at home. Got some food trucks. Making fun of my dog. It's not only has a broken neck and face. I like having dogs in my windshield. It's my thing.  How are you doing? I'm tired. Yeah, both of us are, but we're going to mission for some barbecue. Barbecue is pretty good. Made it to Mission mask. On Judd, has his cup. Which Heroes, what is this goes to Special Operations? Warrior Foundation. So this is a really veteran, Friendly restaurant, super veteran friendly, which is awesome, is amazing. And we go looks really tasty. It is pretty good.  That's called coleslaw and is the best way to have a barbecue here. We both got pulled pork cornbread. The only other food I ate today. I didn't keep down. So I'm hoping this goes. Well, I feel like I can eat but we'll see how my stomach handles are. Well Jack Kate a lot, but I think she overdid it. She might be sick. Dining out is hard when you have gastroparesis, but some mistakes.  We're made lessons were learned. Oh, like I thought I could eat without premeditating. Although when I tried to eat earlier today, without premeditating. I puked a lot. And so I like a te pretty healthy amount and then I became really nauseous. I got up and I was going to run to the restroom to be sick, but the bathroom was on the other end of the restaurant. So I turned around ran out the door and there's  Aren't you just puking all over the bushes in the restaurant?  It was just like, really discouraging. So I come back inside and jobs already getting the IV. We have some leftover IV Zofran from when Insurance approved it and then they decided to not approve it and give me IV Phenergan. So we had some leftover and Jazz already. Getting the IV, Zofran ready? And to put through my port and I'm just there like about to puke again. So here's Jackie about to puke in the restaurant and  So he quickly administered it and it helped, and I'm just like, crying being so frustrated with my gastroparesis. I can't even enjoy a meal out and just it. Sorry. We have faced tougher obstacles and we'll definitely get through this one. Exactly, but it is frustrating and it's okay to cry and be frustrated when you need to and I'm thankful that I'm seeing my GI.\",\n",
       " '8sUv2SuaY': \"Did version of it. A kidney isn't as big as if you're watching this in full screen, it's not going to be as big as this picture is, but we've sliced it so we can see what's going on inside the kidney just to understand the different parts here just because it will actually be significant when we start talking about the functional units or the nephron within the kidney. This area right here from here to here. This is called the renal renal cortex whenever we talk about  Something with the kidney. When, if you see a renal, anything that's actually referring to the kidney. So this right here is a renal cortex that outer part, right there. And then this area right here, this area right here. This is the renal medulla and medulla comes from middle. So it's the, you can always viewed as a middle of the kidney renal.  Mid dual on. Besides just understanding these words. We're going to see that the extra play. A very important role in this actual filtration or this excretion of waste and this ability to not dump too much water or excrete, too much water when we're trying to filter out our blood. So I've said before and you might have heard it already from other lectures or from other teachers at the functional unit of the kidney is the Nephron.  The functional.  Functional unit. And the reason why it's called a functional unit. I'll put it in quotes is because that's the level at which these two things are happening, you know, the two major function of the kidney, the waste excretion, and the mint, a maintenance of the water level in our in our blood system. So, just to get an idea of how a nephron fits in. Within this picture of a kidney, the artist actually, I got this picture from Wikipedia, The Artist tried to do draw a couple of nephrons over here. So a nephron will look something like this.  Ethnic goes into dips down into the medulla and then it goes back into the cortex and then it dumps into collecting ducts. And essentially the fluid will end up in the your readers right here and end up in our urinary bladder that we can later excrete when we find a suitable time, but that's about I guess you can imagine the length of a nephron it goes, you know, this is where it starts and it dips down again. So multiple nephrons are going to keep doing that but they're super thin these tubes or these tubules. Maybe I should say are super thin and act.  An actual kidney, your average kidney, will contain on the order on the order of 1 million nephrons, 1 million nephrons. So even though you can't really say Mike nephrons are microscopic. They kind of have a, you know, you there at least their length when they dip down you say. Oh that's a, you know, I can see that distance. You can still Jam a lot of them inside of one kidney. Well, with that said, let's actually figure out how a nephron does. How it?  Is the blood and actually make sure that not enough not too much water or not too much of the good stuff in our blood ends up in the urine. So let me draw. Let me draw here a nephron. So I'm going to start like this. So let me start with the blood flow. So the blood is going to come in in arterial. That's an arterial capillary you could say so it's going to come in like that. This is actually called the afferent.  Afferent arteriole, you don't have to know the names, but you might see that sometime arterial. Blood is coming in. Then it goes into this big windy place, this big windy place, and it really winds around like that. This is called the glomerulus. This is the glomerulus glomer ulis.  Glamour, you less and then it leaves via the efferent arteriole efferent.  Efferent. Let me switch colors. This red is getting monotonous. This is the efferent arteriole.  Afferent and efferent just means away from the center afferent. Towards F efferent away from the center and I'll talk about it more in the future, but it's interesting that we're still dealing with an artery at this point that it's still oxygenated blood normally when we leave a capillary system like the glomerulus right there where normally a dealing with the venous system, but here we're still in the in a in arterial system and it's probably cuz arterial systems have higher blood pressure. And what we need to do is we need to squeeze fluid and stuff. That's that's  All the fluid out of the blood and in the glomerulus right here. So this glomerulus is very porous and it's surrounded by other cells. So, let me just draw this kind of a cross-section. It's surrounded. You do it like this.  It's surrounded like that.  By this structure. And these are cells here. So you can imagine these are, these are all cells over here. And of course, the actual capillaries have cells that line them. So there are cells here. So when I draw these lines, these lines are actually made up of little cells. What happens is the blood comes in at really high pressure. This is very porous. These cells out here. They're called podocytes. They filter it. They're a little bit more selective in what gets filtered out. And essentially, you have about a fifth of the fluid that's coming in about a fifth of  Fluid that comes in ends up going into this space right here. That's called the Bowman's space. Well, actually, this whole thing is called the Bowman's capsule. You can imagine. It is a, some kind of a, it's a sphere with an opening in here that the capillary can kind of wind around in. And this face right here. This is the Bowman's space is the space inside the Bowman's capsule. So the Bowman's capsule and the whole thing has cells. All of these structures are obviously made or maybe not. So obviously they're made up of cells.  So we end up having filtrate in the filtrate. Is just the stuff that gets squeezed out. So I'll call it filtrate. We can't call it urine just yet because there's a lot of steps that have to occur for it to be kind of to earn the name urine. So it's only filtrate right now. And essentially, what get squeezed out, I said it's about a fifth of the fluid and things that are easily dissolved in fluid. So small ions. So, you know, sodium may be some small molecules like glucose, maybe some.  You know, acids, amino acids, there are tons of stuff in here, but it's just given idea the things that do not get filtered are things like red blood cells, red blood cells or larger molecules larger proteins. They will not get filtered. It's mainly the micro micro molecules that will get filtered. That will be part of this filtrate. That shows up that shows up here in the moment space. Now the rest of what the nephron does, the Bowman's capsule is kind of the beginning of the Nephron.  Just to get an idea, our big picture of our kidney. If let's say that this is a this is a Bowman's, let's say we're near an arterial. This is a Bowman's capsule right here. It looks something like that. And the whole nephron is going to get be convoluted like this. It's going to dip down into the medulla and then come back. And then it's going to eventually dumped into a collecting duct and I'll talk more about that. So what I've drawn just here, this is a zoomed in version of that part, right there. Now. What I want to do is zoom out a little bit because I'm going to run out of space.  He's so let me zoom out. So we had our, we had arterial go and it gets all bunched in in the glomerulus and then most of the blood leaves. But one-fifth of it gets gets essentially filtered in to the Bowman's capsule. That's the Bowman's capsule right there. I'm just zoomed out a little bit. So we have our filtrate here. I'll make a little bit. Maybe I'll make it a little bit yellow so that we have our filtrate right here. That's all, you know, the filtrate that just comes out at this point. Sometimes, it's  Called the glomerular filtrate because it's been filtered by the glomerulus, but it's also been filtered by the podocytes cells on the inside of the Bowman's capsule. But now it's ready to go to the proximal tubule. So the proximal tubule sounds like a very. So let me draw something like this.  And obviously, this is not exactly what it looks like, but it gives you the sense, this right here. This right here. This is the proximal.  To Buell and it sounds like a very fancy word but proximal just means near and tubular you can imagine. It's a small tube. So it's a small tube that's near the beginning. That's why it's called the proximal tubule and it has two parts. It's often. The whole thing is often called a proximal convoluted tubule convoluted tubule and that's because it's all convoluted. Either way. I have drawn it. It's all curvy. And I just drew it. Curvy in two Dimensions. It's actually curvy in three dimensions. But the reality is there's a curvy part and then there's a straight part.  Near the end of the proximal tubules, they'll call this holding the proximal tubule. This is the convoluted part. That's the straight part, but we don't have to get too picky. But the whole point of this part of the Nephron. I'm just to give just remember where we are. We're now at this point of the Nephron right there. The whole point is to start reabsorbing. Some of the stuff that is in the filtrate that we don't want to lose. We don't want to lose glucose. That's that's harder. And stuff that we ate that was good for energy. We don't want to lose.  Necessarily as much sodium that it's we've seen in multiple videos that that's a useful. That's a useful ion to have around. We don't want to use lose amino acids. Those are useful for building up proteins and other things. So these are things we don't want to lose. So we start absorbing them back and I'll do a whole video on exactly how that happens, but it's not actively it's since we're we're using ATP and just as a bit of a summary you using ATP to actually pump out the sodium and then that actually helps bring in the other things. That's just a kind.  A tidbit on what's Happening? So we're reabsorbing. So just imagine what's happening? You have cells, you have cells lining the proximal tubular right now. Actually, they have little things that jut out. I'll do a whole video on that because it's actually interesting. So you have sells out here on the other sides of the cells you have in our arterial system or a capillary system. I should say actually. So let's say you have a capillary system here.  That is very close to the cells lining, the proximal tubule. And so these stuff, the stuff actually gets actively pumped, especially the sodium, but all of it using energy gets pumped back into the blood selectively and maybe a little bit of our water. So we're going to have. So we're pumping back some sodium, some glucose glucose, and we'll start pumping a little bit of the water back in, because we don't want to lose all of that water. If all of the water that was originally, the filtrate we were just leaving our urine. We would be excruciating.  Reading gallons and gallons of water every day, which we do not want to do. So, that's the whole point. We're starting the absorption process, and then we'll enter the loop of henle. And actually, this is in my mind, the most interesting part of the Nephron. So entering the loop of henle and it, dips down, it dips down.\",\n",

       " 'Xo4Crrm0': \"Many of my patients are hesitant to begin injecting insulin, but once they actually try it, it becomes like any other routine. Here's how I teach them, you'll need your bottle of insulin syringe and a Sharps container always wash your hands with soap and water before you begin. Typically they are three syringe sizes. One cc holds 100 units of insulin. A half CC holds.  50 units and a third CC holds 30 units. Talk to your care team about how much insulin you need and which syringe sighs. You should use insulin needles have gotten much smaller over the years, so they are much less painful than you might expect. When you first get your insulin. Keep it refrigerated. After the first time you use it. You can keep it in room. Temperature for 28 to 42 days. It will be more comfortable to inject.  You have cloudy insulin. It needs to be mixed. Gently, roll the bottle in your hand, then rotate it from top to bottom without shaking.  When you're ready to inject, pull the plunger back to the number of units needed drawing air into the syringe. Insert, the needle into the bottle of the insulin, through the rubber cap, inject the air from the syringe into the bottle, turn the bottle, upside down with the needle in it. Make sure the tip of the needle is fully submerged in the insulin. As you pull the plunger back to the correct number of insulin units. This helps prevent air. Bubbles are bubbles.  Harmful, but can take up room and prevent you from getting the right dose. If you have bubbles, simply inject the contents back into the bottle and repeat the procedure next inject at a 90 degree angle.  Hold for 5 seconds, then pull the needle out, drop the syringe into the sharps container, which you can buy at any local pharmacy. Ask your Diabetes Care Manager, work to safely dispose of your Sharps container when it's full make sure not to reuse, insulin needles, as it's not safe and can cause more pain with injection. It's important to switch injection sites to prevent bruising and pain each.  You inject choose a new site, this way, rotate injection sites. In a imaginary Circle. Always leave two fingers with in between injection sites and keep the same distance from your belly button.  Your care team prescribes insulin because it's safe and effective. We're confident, you will be able to use it successfully. If you have any questions about how to inject insulin, or how much to take, ask your care manager, adjusting to a new habit.

       " 'gRMUyXyY': \"Hi everybody. This is Debbie. What total Dash German de shepard.com? And today I'm going to take just a couple minutes to share some information with you about a condition that not a lot of people are aware of that have German Shepherds and it's called Epi or ex campaign created insufficiency. Now, what exactly is exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, also often called epi?  Basically, Epi is a medical condition in which the actual pancreas and your dog stops producing enough. Digestive enzymes to help your dog digest, his food normally in the small intestine. Now, it's a shame. Just how many German Shepherd owners? Don't even have any idea. You know what this condition is or don't even know it exists. And it's also even worse to realize just how many events aren't up to speed on being able to evaluate or treat this, this potential condition in your German Shepherd.  Epi can result from primary pancreatic disease or also, it can occur as a result of any number of diseases that interfere with the correct production of enzymes by your dog's pancreas, or also of those activation of those enzymes, actually within your dog's intestine.  Now, in dogs that are actually diagnosed to have Epi the German Shepherd dog is really, really common, as well as the rough-coated. Collie.  And of those dogs that are actually did not excuse me diagnosed with Epi about 70% of them, are German Shepherd in about, 20% of rough-coated Collies.  Now, what is the pancreas and Epi in the first place? What does it have to do with my German Shepherd?  Well, following basically said, a real brief explanation. The extra part of the name deals with the pancreas and its ability to produce enzymes. We use our dog uses to digest his food properly. Now, without adequate production of these particular enzymes, your dog won't digest his food properly.  So, if your dog can't digest his food properly, it also won't be able to absorb any of the nutrients as well.  So typically the exocrine functions of the pancreas can malfunction in one of two ways. This disorder can be potentially life threatening. Especially this acute form. However, it does respond quite well to ongoing and daily treatments. So like we said before typically the pancreas can malfunction in one of two ways, first of all, and pancreatitis the dogs pancreas actually becomes inflamed which in turn causes vomiting loss of appetite.  Raishin, and this condition requires immediate Veterinary attention now. Secondly, of what you probably see. Most often a previously healthy animal, will soon. Begin to exhibit some or all of the following symptoms. The dog will be ravenously, hungry just can't get enough food to eat. It would just drink water. Like there's just, you know, no tomorrow and this is probably the most Telltale sign of all. He'll have really soft cow, patty types, tools. And so just keep this in mind. No matter how much your dog eats it.  Be hungry soon after. And also this is even even more so important. It'll begin to lose weight.  So, typically EP on the German Shepherd presents itself, somewhere between the ages of 1 to 5 years of age in young, adult dogs.  The diagnosis of Epi also needs to be confirmed by the use of Laboratory test, by your veterinarian.  So what are the signs of epi new German Shepherd?  Well, some of the things to really watch out for diarrhea, really foul smelling feces. And this is due to the high fat content, part of your dog's diet and also because of all the food ingredients are not digested, completely your dog will become now nourished. It will have increased gut sounds, you know, it's like it's stomach's rumbling. It'll have diarrhea and that really foul-smelling cow patty type feces. They'll be weight loss in your dog, even though it's eating like a  Worse. He'll also have a lot of signs of nutritional deficiencies such as dry and brittle hair, maybe even anemia. Like we said before, it'll be just have a ravenous appetite and they'll just be just drink water all the time. So what exactly is our the treatments for EPI and your German Shepherd?  So treatment often involves the use of replacement pancreatic enzymes, and these are given orally to your German Shepherd. Now occasionally your dog will also receive oral antibiotics. Most often. These Epi products are given a powder form or either they're given tablets and you crush those which are then also mixed in with your dog's food and left on it for about 30 minutes or so at room temperature before you actually feed your dog.  So what are the recommended, diets for German shepherds that have a pi, pretty simple, basically deals with feeding your dog, several small meals about three or so, at least you want to feed your dog a highly digestible complete, raishin. And if you have questions about, you know, what choices are speak with your veterinarian. And also, the ideal diet for a German Shepherd, has CPI. It's a food. That's low in fiber, low in fat and low in those excess.  And once your dog is diagnosed with Epi, this treatment is a lifelong commitment for both you and your dog. Now, it may be possible to regulate the condition of Epi in German Shepherds who aren't, you know, so severely affected, you know by giving them a bland or a low fat, low fiber diet with overcome counter supplements, but for those dogs that are more severely affected, a lifetime regime is going to be required. So if for some reason EP  EI enzyme supplementation, stop for any reason. Then all those unpleasant symptoms were recurring your dog and very soon after you stop the supplementation. So oftentimes, the German Shepherds response to therapy can also be seen within a week or so of starting treatment. So if your dog is having any of those problems with the, you know, the foul-smelling stools, a cow pedestals ravenous appetite, once you start giving your dog the supplementation, it'll probably start having better results. You'll be seeing better pues, and a lot of other symptoms will start reducing  Very, very short period of time.  Now, the owner of a German Shepherd, who is actually been diagnosed with, Epi needs to be very attentive to their dogs overall condition at all times.  So after you actually figure out the exact amount of enzymes that are needed to produce, normal stools in your dog and to help stop that weight loss. Your, you can also begin to actually feed your dog enough food. To help your dog, even regain some of that way that it's lost previously and just keep in mind. Also, relapse is, are always possible and they are shown it in either the possibility of, you know, the return of that diarrhea or also in resume weight loss.  So the owner has to to really keep a careful watch out for any of these returning symptoms. Now generally speaking, as long as you're very Vigilant in maintaining the dog's diet and giving it the proper enzyme supplements. The dog that has a pi can you know, easily live, very happy and relatively normal life. Just so long as you. Keep us up, limitation up.

       " 'CrjjN2sXB_g': \"To do with the acid levels, in the particular patient and this is an inhibitor of some of those issues and has helped to control the diabetes issues. But what we're seeing is again, with real safety concerns with Johnson & Johnson, being raised, and real, very serious concerns and a lot of very serious adverse side effects for these patients where, you know, it appears that Johnson & Johnson is not properly tested. This Blockbuster Mark Drug before bringing it to Market and putting Millions.  Millions of dollars behind their advertising instead of more clinical trials, prior to pushing it out Nationwide. And what's really interesting, is it, you know, Invokana commercials are very common on television, obviously, because, you know, type 2. Diabetes is becoming more and more common these days. And so in these commercials, as we've often seen, they show the happy people, once they're on the medication. They're living their lives are out there having fun, their barbecue in there. They're exercising. And then in the  The real, you know, professional speak. They start giving all these Invokana, make calls yada yada, yada yada, and that's what they do. I mean, there is a difference. The, the side effects are spoken at a high school grade level. The benefits of the drugs are always spoken at a grade school level. This, you know, study after study has shown that, this is the way that these drugs are marketed. And when we're talking about a drug like Invokana, we're looking at something that is causing kidney failure.  Heart attacks ketoacidosis. And this is a drug that is meant to, you know, help excrete blood sugar from the bloodstream through the kidneys. And now, those were just the first side effects. We know of now we're starting to see things where people are losing limbs as a result of taking this medication. Yeah, that's right. I mean, that's the latest FDA advisory that's come out. Is that there are a number of cases of amputation, of course, you know diabetes.  These patients are can be prone to risk for amputation and loss of limb loss of toes. A lot of times. That's where it starts. If you have a serious diabetes condition, you have to always be cognizant of that. But the information that's coming out as in this recent clinical trial tests, which the FDA has issued an advisory about it and said that they're going to be checking into further, is that the Invokana drug is greatly? Increasing the propensity for these types of  Of amputations. So first this is this is how the kind of the pattern for a lot of these drugs unfortunately is played out, is it just information keeps on seeping out about some of the concerns here? First, starting with heart attack, stroke bone fracture, and things like that. As last year. Those were the advisories that are coming out and now more recently the amputation wrist. So, the issue is that with a lot of these drugs, there are side-effects, of course, but the issue is, whether the manufacturer in this case, Johnson & Johnson is proper, have properly,  Warned about the potential side effects so that the physician and the patient can make an educated decision about whether or not the drug is Pros, outweigh the potential cons and the risk and Johnson & Johnson has not properly warned of these risks, which are now are only coming out after the fact. And that is really the disconcerting thing. You know, Johnson Johnson, when we think of it as such a household product in the baby to baby shower and and talcum powder, which were we're learning a lot about cervical cancer. They are unfortunately, but it's a  Old name, but obviously with the systemic problems at Johnson & Johnson, it certainly appears at advertising and profit is a primary motive here. Perhaps over patient, safety. We know you pointed out something very interesting there and I want to expand on that just a little bit. And that's the fact that it's not that the drug or any drugs, cause side effects. So, you know, even Ibuprofen and Tylenol can cause side effects. A lot of it has to do with the risk benefit.  This, you know, the side effect of it, versus what it does. But the most important thing in this is where lawsuits come from is, what did the company? No, did they hide it? Did they properly deliver this information to Physicians and patients? And it's when there is a cover-up or when they did not disclose that, they face liability. It's not just because their product, you know, isn't doing everything it says. It's because they knew it wouldn't and they hid the dangers. And I think that's something.  That the public needs to understand people don't just get sued, you know, for no reason it's because there was a cover-up because there was no warning. That's correct. That's correct in it, you know, the warnings and we see the fine print and so forth. But and you wonder how much consumers really understand. As you say with the TV commercials, or you look in the, you know, the weekly periodicals and things, and you've got all this fun print, which of course goes goes over, everyone's head. But a lot of it is education of the Physicians as well, instead, Johnson.  Runs in his pain tens of millions of dollars in marketing. The products for medical Consultants, why? Literally wining and dining a lot of Physicians to the tune of a couple million dollars in food and beverage expenditures for this particular drug, and so their glossing over a lot of these issues and either they knew of the problems and they haven't given proper warnings or they didn't do sufficient, you know, medical and clinical trials to determine what the side effects were. And so if a black box warning goes on,  A particular drug Studies have shown that the prescriptions of that drug may go down by about 40 percent. And that's what these manufacturers don't want. And so they're making an oftentimes. Unfortunately, they're making calculated decisions about whether it's better to avoid the Black Box warning and take their chances on the liability side and deal with the lawsuits that come, as a result of the various injuries, amputations stroke heart attack or death, versus having a there, you know, drug, which they are talking about on their quarterly.  Street conference calls that this is a great deal. We're getting great market share in this huge patient population for diabetes. So that is the issue is the Black Box. Warnings appropriate warnings to the patients. The patients need to Johnson Johnson, a very sophisticated company. They need to be putting out all of the information that they have about. These drugs have patients can make informed decisions. As we've seen too many times, that always comes down to profits over patients and that's why you people like you the trial lawyers.

       " '4blxYRF4': \"Another example, will you be at home tonight? Yes. Yes. I will. You be at home tonight. Now you be home at night tonight. What's the answer? Yes. I know if I will or - no, I don't want that will to party.  Are you going to apply? What a surprise you about having me in your class?  How enjoyable it is it? She's just a very, very dear woman. So and so eager to learn anecdotally. One of the students said. I was just admiring her ability and said, God gave her inside eyes provides. Yeah.  Our special needs coordinator provides the Braille and keeps up with the daily lessons, so we can provide her exactly what the students are doing. All the students are doing. We get some of the Braille also from State services for the Blind and they've given her this new laptop and training for that. We and they've all a panda has given us resources as well, such as raised maps and since we do,  Do some study of history and geography and class. Those are very helpful. I do not know how to read Braille at all. Luckily. Our special needs coordinator has developed a great system of numbering the pages as well as what exercise. We are on the page. So now I'm getting much more Adept at finding her place quickly and she is too, so that's working out. She writes in the with the slate and stylus, but we're moving her over to you.  Using the text edit on the laptop and then she will write her assignments and tests on that. And then she emails them to me. And that's become a very effective way for me to see her work as well as for her to get immediate feedback. I wish that many of the other students could stay on track as well as she can. Her listening skills are phenomenal, so she can just really stay with it. There's  One of the troubles that we have is sometimes finding the place. And so there's, you know, the, the other students are extremely patient if it takes a little more time to do, that may was working with a volunteer. Yes. What type of special instructions? Do you give to your volunteers? Well, I asked them to listen to me a rather than read to her and let her do the reading. How is preparing for class is different with me in your glass. Well, I  have to be up on exactly what we're going to need, so I can give that to the special needs coordinator and will be on schedule.  In class. There's that kind of, I've got to allow for sometimes, sometimes to to help her find her place, get the laptop setup and other things like that. So I have to kind of make sure I've got something else for the other students to do while we're working on that.  It's not easy, you know, it's an, it's an additional level of management both with working with me and with, with the other students, being able to work with that. So.  it's not easy, and it's  There's a lot of benefit to it. So I'm not going to say it's not worth it, but it does add another level of management and and time to doing the preparation.  May you send email that to me finish and then in me up David, aw, yeah. Okay, great. So I just did it. Just yeah, save it but you've got a few more minutes to do a few more of the questions.  The answer is yes, what's been one of the challenges that you've had with me? One of the big challenges is her reading speed because she has to feel each letter in order to get the whole word. She can't just you know, get it automatically so it does take time. So, one thing that I do is I make sure that she gets from Reading ahead of time and I often will email her her.  So that she can listen to it through voice over and know what to expect the next day in class so that she can be well, prepared and be able to participate with everyone else. I'm surprised you about having met in your class. She adds a very, very unique perspective in our class and I think it's been neat for the other students to see and be kind of inspired by her, by her abilities, and determination to continue continue progressing and her  kills, even though she has a disability. So I think it's been, you know, a wonderful addition to our class and a very good learning experience for everybody. What I did.  Don't, you know, Hoops? Yeah, so I haven't sitting up front in the classroom. And so we can really focus on me and my instruction. He also uses a hand magnifier to see the see the print even though I'm large copies for him. He still uses the hand magnifier so we can clearly see.  The words that are in print, let's sit on a magnifier something that we provide for him and he uses it and all his classes. I think the good thing is that it does help him, you know, to see clearly the words and I think he's become adapted at using it and, and being able to read with it. I think they downsize it outside. Is that it slows him down. There's no way we can have a magnifier may not have Fighter the whole page.  Out. It's kind of, you know, magnifying each word separately. And I think, you know, in the end that does slow him down with learning. So I do, you know, check his understanding, make sure that, he understands what he's reading. I do sit down with them separately because of that. So I'm kind of unsure as of yet in how much, you know, that's affecting his understanding of what he's reading. Using the hand magnifier what other strategies do you use to  Hate the fact that he cannot see the board. I always repeat two things, two, or maybe even three times. What could I write on the board? And I think, because I do that all the time, I think the students, all the other students don't think I'm doing it. Just for the for him. I mean, this was an ESL class. So all our students are struggling with English, so, you know, repeating things is  Actually good for all my students. It's not just good for a velop. I also sometimes print out things that I write on the board. Like if it's a particular assignment that I write on the board or I'll make a copy of it for him, while the other students are are copying and from the from the board.  The CCTV. It's a computerized method of enlarging reading material. It's kind of like using microfilm, where you put a text book or  Sheet of paper underneath a light and then it's enlarged on a computer screen.  The positive aspects of the CCTV especially when compared to the hand making a fire is that you can see more of the text at once. So, it's not just going from one word to the next word. You get a sense of the whole reading passage, which I think is really important.  The downside of the ICC TV is that it don't get a sense of the whole format of the page. They're only seen a small part of the page. And so they have to manipulate the piece of paper underneath. So they'll come when they're reading. They'll come to a point where at they have to move it if they're reading from left to right we still have  Have to move the paper to the keep moving the paper to the left, so they can read the whole line and then move it back to the right when they start the next line. And I think it sometimes that might cause them to lose their place. Well, working with visually impaired students. I've noticed that it really makes me a better teacher because I really have to thank  More about the students needs or maybe before I didn't, and in needs in a way that I want to make sure that they understand everything that's going on in the lesson. And so, it's forced me, not only to check the understanding of those visually impaired students, but you check the understanding of all students.\",\n",

Prediabetes is a wake-up call that you are on the path to diabetes, but it's not too late to turn things around.  If you have it, like 79 million, other Americans, your blood sugar glucose level is higher than it should be, but not in the diabetes range. People used to call it borderline diabetes.  Normally your body makes a hormone called insulin to help control your blood sugar. When you have pre-diabetes that system doesn't work as well as it should. You might not be able to make enough insulin after eating or your body might not respond to insulin properly. Pre-diabetes makes you more likely to get heart disease, or have a stroke. But you can take action to lower those risks.  Diagnosis, your doctor will give you one of three simple blood tests.  Fasting. Plasma glucose test. You won't eat 48 hours before taking this blood test. The results are  Normal, if your blood sugar is less than 100.  Prediabetes if your blood sugar is 100 to 125 diabetes. If your blood sugar is 126 or higher.  Oral glucose tolerance. Test first, you'll take the fasting glucose test. Then you'll drink a sugary solution, 2 hours after that. You'll take another blood test. The results are  Normal, if your blood sugar is less than 140 after the second test pre-diabetes. If your blood sugar is 142, 199 after the second test diabetes. If your blood sugar is 200 or higher after the second test.  Hemoglobin A1c or average blood sugar test this blood test shows your average blood sugar level for the past 3 to 4 months. Doctors can use it to diagnose pre-diabetes or diabetes or if you already know you have diabetes. It helps show whether it's under control. The results are  Normal, 5.6 percent or less.  Prediabetes 5.72, 6.4 percent.  Diabetes, 6.5 percent or above. You may need to take the test again to confirm the results.  three key lifestyle changes to make now,  Lifestyle changes can help many people with pre-diabetes delay or prevent it from becoming diabetes. In a large research study, called the diabetes prevention program, these changes cut the odds of getting diabetes.  One weight control, if you are overweight.

       " 'zY5nyvZ7cU': \"To be reabsorbed out of the filtrate. So let's start in the and the mechanisms actually reasonably similar in the different in the different parts of the Nephron, but let's look at each of the parts because they're each reabsorbing different types of molecules. And I won't go through all of the molecules. I'll just give you a sense of things. Let's start with the proximal tubule right here. So let's say if we were to zoom in, if we were to zoom in right over on that part, so let me draw the inside of the Nephron.  The inside of the Nephron maybe looks something like this.  So, this is the inside. This is where our filtrate is.  Right here. Actually, let me draw a little bit different than that. So the inside I'm going to draw it like this. Let me draw it like this because the proximal tubule has these little things that stick out sometimes referred to as a brush border. Let me write that. So this is our, this inside right here. This is our lumen.  That is the Lumen. That is where the filtrate is. So, the filtrate, the glomerular. Filtrate is coming in this direction. This is our filtrate.  Our filtrate is this is you can imagine the inside of the Nephron and then the border of the tubule is made up by a bunch of cells. So maybe this is one cell right here. This is another cell right here, make some cells, that's another cell. Obviously. This is a cross section would actually more of a cylinder would go around like that. But this is to give an idea. That's another cell right there and maybe this is their basil side.  Right there. And when we said baseball, you can imagine that's kind of the base of the cell. So let me actually, those are good words to know fancy words. So the side of the cells that are facing the Lumen or kind of facing the inside of our tube, you'll this is called the apical side.  Apical.  Apical. And then this side is normally referred to as the, basal lateral side or the basal lateral, or this membrane. If you view this as a membrane, this would be the basal lateral membrane. This is true. What regardless of what part of the Nephron were even to the proximal, whether in the loop of henle. We were there in the distal part of what we have here and on the other sides of these cells will have our peritubular capillaries and that's another fancy word. So our peritubular  He's will look something like this directory cells as well.  They're actually cells as well. Actually, instead of drawing the cells. I'll just draw. It is kind of the tube of. I'll just draw it like this there, porous. So this is actually blood flow right here. This is blood right here. This is blood right here. I'm not going to do too much detail on the actual cells of the capillary walls. I really want to give you the idea of how things are transported out of the Lumen, how they're selectively reabsorbed. And so, and just to get this is the peritubular capillary tube.  Euler tubular capillary and once again fancy word, but Perry means around like perimeter. So it's around the tubes. These capillaries go around the tubes. If I were to Overlay it on this picture, we have these capillaries that are going all around the tubes so that when things get secreted or reabsorbed out of the nephrons, they're going into those capillaries. So, this is our peritubular. This is our proximal convoluted membrane right here. We said, let's think about what happens with the glucose.  So what happens is we actually have sodium potassium, pumps, sodium, potassium pumps on the basal lateral side of these cells. So this is sodium, potassium pumps. I'll just draw one right here and you might want to watch the video on sodium. Potassium pumps. I have a whole video on it. But the idea here is that sodium sodium. Maybe I'll draw us plus particles right there. They'll attach on the inside right here. ATP will come along.  When ATP attaches to the right part of this protein, it will change its shape, its conformation. And then the protein will essentially close on this side and open on that side, and then send. And then when it's in that confirmation, the sodium doesn't want to bond as much to the protein and it will go outside it across the basolateral membrane and eventually make its way into the blood. And then on the other side. It's a sodium potassium pump. When it's in this kind of  Of open configuration. I'll draw it over here. What it's in this open configuration. I have a whole video on this. It's very at that point, potassium likes to bond to it. So potassium likes to bond to it. It bonds to it. Maybe, well, maybe in bonds to it over here. This is a gross oversimplification that causes the protein to change its confirmation. It doesn't require ATP at that point and it goes back to this confirmation and then the potassium doesn't want to bond anymore, and then it gets released because it's the protein is now different shape.  General idea. Sodium bonds, ATP bonds, the ATP gets it, phosphate popped off of it. That changes the shape of the protein to this. Now, the sodium wants to get released and now potassium wants to join when potassium joins we get to our original one. The end product of this is where having sodium being pumped out of the cell and we're having potassium being pumped into the cell and this is active transport. This is active transport. Why is it acting?  Of Transport because we're using ATP to drive sodium against its concentration. Gradient to keep pumping the sodium out of the cell and then the potassium kind of comes in. You could almost imagine passively. It doesn't require ATP. And that's why this is often called a sodium potassium atpase, which is means it's a, it's a protein or enzyme that breaks ATP but it breaks ATP. It uses that energy to change its shape to pump, sodium out and potassium in.  Anyway, this is all a review of what we learned in those videos. But how does that help us? For example, get glucose out of our Lumen, what we have over here is, we have other proteins. I'll just do the example of glucose. Let's say we have a protein here.  And we call this a very general term for this as a code transporter or a symporter CO trans Porter or a symporter, and symporter means that Transit. It transfers two types of molecules in the same direction. Co-transporter means one molecule wants to go through because of its concentration gradient and the other molecule kind of goes along for the ride. So you can imagine, we're actively pumping out sodium so for actively.  Hang out. Sodium over here on the basolateral side. Then we're going to have a low sodium concentration here low. We have we're going to have a low sodium concentration there. The more we pump out the lower. This is an adventure is going to be lower than the sodium concentration in the Lumen. So the sodium concentration gradient, if sodium, if there was no membrane here, sodium would want to go across this to kind of make up for all the Lost sodium's over here. Sodium, would want to cross that if there was no barrier. And what the the cells here is take advantage.  Advantage of sodium wanting to move down its concentration, gradient, which is happening, because of this active transport over here, but it uses that energy of sodium going down. Its concentration gradient to actually also transport in this case, to actually also transport, maybe some glucose. So just you have to visualize it, you can imagine them, you know, a protein that's on this apical membrane right here. So let's say we have a big protein. Well, let me draw it, something like this, so,  Maybe it looks something like this is to get some type of visualization. Maybe you know, you have more sodium on this side then you have on this side. So sodium is more likely to bond here, maybe glucose.  Will bond here. This is just a simplification. But when they bond, this protein is going to change its shape. It's going to change its shape to look something more like this. When the two when they when they bond and now the sodium is going to be here and the glucose is going to be here where essentially on the, on the inside of the cell now. And in this confirmation, they don't want to bond as much to the amino acids, or whatever else is in the protein, and then they get released. And when they get released, then the protein will change its shape back.  This right here and we can do the cycle over again, but this is all stipulated on the idea that there's more, there's more sodium over here to bump into this point to make this reaction happen. So, sodium is going to go down its concentration, gradient. It's taking glucose for the ride. And then, so essentially glucose concentration will go up high here. And then if we make this porous to glucose to glucose can go through, then glucose will, eventually if this gets high enough, it will just go down, its concentration, gradient eventually into the blood and this  The same exact process is happening. Not maybe not exactly with glucose. But throughout the entire nephron, if we go to the loop of henle, if we go to the ascending part right here where we're trying to get the salt out of the picture, same idea. Same idea. Let me draw it. So let's say that. That right there is the lumen  This is a cell that makes up the wall of the Lumen. So this is a, this were in the loop of henle now, and you have a sodium potassium, pump out here. You have sodium being pumped out, you have potassium, gets pumped in but actually, potassium channels are leaky. So potassium can often make its way back out in either direction. So that's why what's happening to potassium? Isn't that important? But so sodium concentration becomes low here. So what we have  Are symporters.  Over here.  It's a symporter over here, just like we had with glucose, but in this case, sodium wants to enter just as the case with glucose, but here we're trying to transport chlorine and potassium ions. So that's what we're going to join. That's what's going to take advantage of sodium concentration, gradient. We're going to have, we're going to have potassium. We're going to have chlorine ions. And actually this symporter right here. It's called the sodium potassium chlorine co-transporter and it's actually it's the second variation that we actually get in the ascending Loop.  Only and So eventually you're going to end up with a lot of chlorine here. Actually potassium from both directions. But as long as this is porous to chlorine, if this concentration, gets high enough to chlorine is going to make its way out and help make the medulla that much saltier as along with the Sodium, same thing in the distal convoluted tubule their calcium. It's a little bit different. So if we're in the distal convoluted tubule, so let's say we're in the distal convoluted tubule, these kind of villi these things that stick out. This is only in the car.  Proximal convoluted tubule this brush borders.  But over there and just so, you know, this, this idea where we're using a concentration gradient, that's driven by some type of active.\",\n",
       " '6H_jPqjLKk': \"What happens is this ends up leading to the breakdown of fats into glucose, which results in Ketone bodies, which are acidic. Okay, that's very simply we're going to get into this a little bit more here. So we have severe insulin deficiency, or no insulin at all, which leads to the breakdown of fats into glucose for energy, and that results in acidic ketones in the body. So, very quickly to tell you the assessment and then we're going to go over it a little bit really quick. So, what  Happens is it's a sudden onset. It's usually associated with infection or stress. You're going to notice fruity breath on your patient. And that is a result of those acid bodies, which are, which have kind of a fruity smell ketones, are going to be released into the urine. You're going to severe hyperglycemia generally in, like the 400 to 600 range with dka  You're going to dehydration, and this is due to osmotic. Diuresis, which will go over a little bit more in the next slide. You're also going to have acidosis. Okay, what is acidosis? Acidosis is a pH of less than 7.35, right? And then it's going to be also an hco3.  Of less than 22. Okay, so we're going to have a decrease in PH and we're going to see a decrease in bicarb.  Because of this acidosis, the reason acidosis occurs is because these fats are broken down into glucose. These ketones are a byproduct of the fat breakdown. Ketones are very acidic and potassium begins to leave the cell. As a result of this acidosis. You're also going to see these kussmaul respirations in your patient and like we said this hyperkalemia, the hyperkalemia is associated with this acidosis. You're also going to see an elevated. Be you in and creatinine and that's a result of this osmotic.  Reese's. As you begin to put out all this urine. You see an elevated creatinine associated with that renal failure, you're also going to want to monitor level of Consciousness, cerebral edema can occur due to this fluid shift, as we become the highly osmotic, and your patience level of Consciousness. Okay. So let's look at it one more time really quick. So what happens is we have a decreased level of insulin.  Or essentially what happens is, the body is no longer producing insulin. Okay, so because we do not have insulin. All right, so our cell can use  So our cell can use glucose and fatty acids to produce energy. Right? And so within the mitochondria can break down glucose. It can break down fatty acids to produce ATP, right, but in order to use glucose, it has to have insulin.  Right. Okay. So here's our cell glucose is outside the cell. We've already talked about this before that in order to get into the cell.  It needs insulin.  So without the presence of insulin glucose is unable to get into the cell. So glucose is going to remain outside the cell. All right, but the cell has another way that it can, it can use energy. It can actually break down fatty acids. Okay. So when these fatty acids are broken down, we get enough energy to kind of carry out cellular metabolism, but we still remain with this glucose outside the cell,  so,  What happens when we when we do not have insulin as the cell starts to break down fatty acids?  Okay, this leads to acidosis.  Okay, which is our pH less than 7.35 and a bicarb.  Of less than 22, okay.  No, it's going to be an anion gap acidosis. If you want to learn more about that. There's actually some really good videos on YouTube by med crayon about what anion gap is, but for our purposes, we just need to understand this is going to lead to acidosis due to this acidosis. We're also going to see  Hyperkalemia.  Okay.  now, it also leads to  what we do not have insulin. This is also going to lead to an elevated glucose level, right? So, insulin glucose is not getting into the cell. So our glucose is rising within our blood, so our glucose continues to rise, continues to rise because we are not pulling it into the cell to use it instead of using these fatty acids. So, as that glucose Rises,  This is going to lead to osmotic.  Diuresis.  Okay, we're simply means that our osmotic pressure becomes so great that the kidneys begin to dump it. All okay.  And this is going to lead to the renal failure, and the elevated creatinine.  Okay, so that's kind of what's Happening Here to things are happening. And that's what we need to understand. Two things are happening. We're breaking down fatty acids, and that's leading to acidosis.  We're also not using glucose and that's leading to hyperglycemia.  Okay. So now that we have those two things understood. Okay. Now you understand it very simply here, right? It's very, very simple. Once we break it down like this. We are not, we do not have insulin available. So our body has to get that energy from somewhere, right? The place that is getting that energy is from breaking down these fatty acids. Now, we just said right there. These are fatty acids. So we're going to develop acidosis. Okay, and because of that we're going to develop hyperkalemia. Now, the other thing that's happening here. We still have all  Glucose circulating in the cells or without in the blood. So he still has glucose circulating in the blood that's leading to hyperglycemia at the same time. We're developing this acidosis. So we're diabetic kedo acidosis. Okay.  So, our blood sugars are going to rise. And again, they're not going to rise as high as they are, not hhns because we're using a little bit of this energy. Okay. So how we going to treat these patients? Okay.  We're going to treat these patients with very intensive, insulin therapy. What insulin is going to do for us is going to do a couple things.  Insulin is going to help to correct this acidosis. Okay?  It's also going to help to lower the glucose. Okay, but our goal here, with the, the with diabetic ketoacidosis is to correct this acidosis. That's our primary concern here is correcting this acidosis. As we correct that acidosis. Our potassium is going to improve, right? We know that that insulin is one of the therapies for hyperkalemia, right? With insulin. We can pull potassium back into the cell and with insulin.  So we can correct acidosis, okay.  So the other thing that is going to do at the same time, however is it's going to correct our glucose level. So as we're correcting, our acidosis were also correcting their glucose level. Remember, our patient is also very dehydrated.  And so what are we going to give for dehydration? We're going to give fluids.  So we're going to give fluids to our patient, that's going to correct the dehydration and the due to this osmotic. Diuresis. So we correct that osmotic, diuresis by getting fluids and that helps to correct that patient there. Then we give our insulin to correct acidosis and that also brings down our our blood sugar's. Okay.  So we're going to treat the dehydration. We're going to place a the patient intensive, insulin therapy. We're going to monitor potassium, and we're going to assess for and treat acidosis. If you want to learn more about this anion gap, acidosis. You can check out The Merck Manual. That's one resource. You can check out there, but that's really kind of the basics. If you can draw this diagram, you get dka, okay, and if you get dka, you get the treatments and your understanding better.  Abg's and everything that's going on there. Okay, so that's really what's going on with dka and that's how you can understand why it pertains only. Well, most commonly to type 1 diabetics and why it's different than hhns. Okay, so, that's what we need to understand here. If you have any questions with that guys, please let me know.\",\n",
       " '8K8MkKHJoc': \"Six foods to avoid, if you have metabolic syndrome, there's a good chance. You've never heard of metabolic syndrome, which is sometimes referred to, as metabolic disease. It's actually a group of issues that when combined can significantly increase one's chance of developing heart disease, diabetes and stroke. Typically the chances of acquiring metabolic syndrome increase as we age with nearly half of all Americans. Narcan's in their 60s and 70s being affected by the issue, the symptoms of this disease. Very widely though. Metabolic syndrome patients. Do tend to have more weight around the abdomen than the average person. They may also be resistant to insulin or struggle with increased production of insulin. Sometimes symptoms show on the body, such as through the emergence of skin tags and benign growths. The good news is that there are ways to reduce the impact of metabolic syndrome.  Mmm, for example, one can make a serious difference in their health by simply avoiding certain foods. So what foods should you avoid? If you've been diagnosed with this condition?  One fake sweeteners.  A few decades ago the hottest Trend to hit the food and beverage industry was without a doubt. The diet alternative Coke was now joined by Diet Coke Pepsi by Diet Pepsi. Eventually just about every major food product had a diet equivalent and in cases, where the central ingredient was sugar that meant replacing it with an artificial sweetener.  These artificial sweeteners have become household names in the years since there is aspartame, sucralose and saccharine. Unfortunately, there is still not a lot of evidence to suggest these replacements for sugar are actually okay for the human body. In fact, some evidence suggests. They could be dangerous. And may increase the chances of gaining weight, developing diabetes, or even having heart disease emerge for someone with metabolic syndrome. It  Almost goes without saying that these fake sweeteners must be avoided.  Two died pop.  There was a time when only people on actual diets would drink diet soda. Now, however, many diet sodas outsell the regular counterparts. And while it's true that most diet sodas have zero calories, and no added sugar. They often replace sugar with chemicals. We just don't know that much about. For example, it's still not clear if taking sugar out of a soda and replacing it with sucralose, does anything to improve one's chances of keeping off weight or holding.  Type 2 diabetes at arm's length, for those who have been diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. It just isn't worth the risk. Instead stick to water and unsweetened green tea.  Three-point trans fats.  A few years ago, many of the biggest companies in the food and beverage industry, made a serious effort to remove trans fats from their products. That's because trans fats, which are most often found in foods made using hydrogenated oils and fats can increase ones chances of becoming overweight, and developing hard related health problems, but many foods and particularly highly processed baked goods, still contain trans fats, although the number of  With trans fats in them is, dwindling, anyone with metabolic syndrome should be vigilant in seeking foods that have absolutely zero, trans fats contained inside.  Four-point, refined sugars.  Consuming too much refined sugar and carbohydrates can cause insulin levels to spike increasing the chances. That someone will develop type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome. It can also lead to significant weight gain, which can place undue pressure on the heart and other parts of the body from the bones and joints to muscles, and major organs. Because they have already been identified as being at increased risk of developing heart disease, diabetes and stroke.  With metabolic syndrome, need to severely limit their exposure, to refined sugars and carbohydrates, which can often be found in highly processed foods like bread and cookies.  Five alcohol.  There's no denying that many of the world's most vibrant. Cultures are heavily steeped in alcohol consumption in films, television shows and books. Drinking alcohol is often cast as acceptable, even desirable in order to Win Friends and enjoy life, but alcohol consumption, especially to access places huge pressures on the body. For one. It contains a lot of calories which add up and can eventually lead to significant weight gain,  S drinking a lot of alcohol can raise your blood pressure and make you more vulnerable to heart disease. Given the people with metabolic syndrome are already vulnerable to heart problems. It makes sense that they should avoid drinking alcohol at all costs.  Six, highly processed foods.  Individuals who have been diagnosed with metabolic syndrome, should immediately go through their kitchen in search of the most heavily processed foods. Once these foods are rounded up and in the typical American kitchen, that could take some time. They should be thrown it in the waste bin. That's because highly processed foods, whether Frozen, canned, boxed or bagged, have none of the nutrients that people with metabolic syndrome, need to manage their condition often. These foods are loaded down.  Salt sugar, and preservatives.\",\n",
       " '1vvigy5tQ': \"Is a disease. It's not something created by lack of character. It's a hormonal disease, and there are many hormones involved. And one of the main ones is a hormone called insulin. Most obese individuals are resistant to this hormone insulin. So what does that mean exactly to be resistant to insulin? Well, insulin resistance is essentially a state of pre pre type 2 diabetes. Insulins job is to drive glucose.  Or blood sugar into the cells where it can be used in a nutshell. When someone is insulin resistant, they are having trouble getting blood sugar where it needs to go into those cells and it just can't hang out in the blood after we eat or we would all have a diabetic crisis after every meal. So when someone is resistant to insulin, the body's response to this is to just make more of it. And insulin levels will rise and rise and for a while.  Years, even this is going to keep up and blood sugar levels can remain normal. However, usually it can't keep up forever. And even at those elevated levels of insulin are not enough to keep blood sugar in the normal range. So it starts to rise that's diabetes. It probably won't surprise you to hear that. Most of my patients have insulin resistance or diabetes. And if you're sitting there thinking that's not me. Yeah, actually.  We might want to think again because almost 50% of adult Americans now have diabetes or pre-diabetes. That is almost 120 million of us, but that's hardly, everyone who has issues with insulin. Because as I was saying, people have elevated insulin levels due to insulin resistance for years, even decades, before the diagnosis of even pre-diabetes is made. Plus. It's been shown that  Team to, 25% of normal weight adults are also insulin resistant. So in case you're keeping track, this is a heck of a lot of us. So, the trouble with insulin resistance is, if it goes up, we are at Great risk for developing type 2 diabetes, but also insulin makes us hungry and the food, we eat much more likely to be stored as fat.  Alan is our fat storage hormone so we can start to see how it's going to be a problem for diseases like obesity and metabolic issues like diabetes, but what if we trace this problem back to the beginning and we just didn't have so much glucose around that insulin needed to deal with. Let's take a look at how that could be. Everything. You eat is either a carbohydrate a protein or a fat and they all have a very different  Effect on glucose, and therefore insulin levels as you can see on the graph. So, when we eat carbohydrates, are insulin and glucose are going to spike up fast and with proteins, it looks a lot better but take a look at what happens when we eat fat essentially, nothing a flat line and this is going to wind up being very important. So now, I want to translate that graph for you into a real-world situation.  I want you to go back and think about the last time you ate an American version of Chinese food. We all know there's rules associated with this. Right? And the first rule is you're going to overeat because the stop signal doesn't get sent until you are literally busting at the seams rule. Number two is in an hour, you're starving. Why? Well, because the rice in that meal caused glucose and Insulin to Skyrocket, which triggered hunger fat  Rage and Cravings. So if your insulin resistant to begin with and your insulin levels are already higher, you really are hungry or all the time and we have this setup, eat carbs, your glucose goes up, your insulin goes up and you have hunger and fat storage. So how do we recommend to these people to eat? Because it seems like that would be really important and it is, let's focus. Just on type 2 diabetes.  He's because the general recommendations are to tell patients with type 2 diabetes to consume 40 to 65 grams of carbohydrates, per meal, plus more at snacks. Trust me on this. That's a lot of carbs. And remember what's going to happen to glucose and Insulin, blood sugar, and Insulin when we eat them. Yes, we are essentially recommending that they eat exactly what's causing their problem. Sound crazy.  Really really is because at its root diabetes. Is a state of carbohydrate toxicity. We can't get the blood sugar into the cells and that causes a problem in the short term, but the long-term consequences are even greater. And insulin resistance is essentially a state of carbohydrate intolerance. So why a, why do we want to continue to recommend to people to eat them the American Diabetes?  Ation guidelines specifically state that there is inconclusive evidence to recommend a specific carbohydrate limit, but those guidelines go right on to say what we all know a carbohydrate intake is the single biggest factor in blood sugar levels and therefore need for medication. These guidelines, then go on to say, hey, look, if you're taking certain diabetic medications, you actually have to eat carbs other.  Otherwise, your blood sugar can go too low. Okay. So let's take a look at the Vicious Cycle. That that advice just set up. So it's eat carbs. So you have to take medicine. Then you have to eat more carbs to. You avoid the side effect of those medications and around and around we go even worse. Is that nowhere in the Ada? Guidelines is the goal of reversing type 2 diabetes. This needs to be changed because type  2, diabetes can be reversed in many, if not most situations, especially if we start early. Not only do we need to let people know this but we have to start giving them the Practical advice so they can do this consider carps first. Here's a shocker for you. We don't need them. Seriously. Our minimum daily requirement for carbohydrates is 0. We have Central Amino.  Acids, those are proteins essential fatty acids, but nope no essential carb. A nutrient is essential if we have to have it to function and we can't make it from something else. We make, glucose plenty of it all the time. It's called gluconeogenesis. So we don't need them. The overconsumption of them is making us very sick. Yet. We are continuing to recommend to patients to consume close to if not more than half.  Half of their total energy intake every day from them. It doesn't make sense. Let's talk about, what does cutting carbs a lot. Yes, in my clinic. We teach patients to eat with carbs as the minority of their intake. Not the majority. So how does that work? Well, when our patients decrease, their carbs, their glucose goes down and they don't need as much insulin. So those insulin levels, drop and fast. And  This is very important because a study looking at our national health and nutrition examination, survey data better known as nhanes showed that the single biggest risk factor for coronary artery disease, is insulin resistance. It is responsible for a whopping 42 percent of heart attacks. Low-carb intervention works so fast that we can literally pull people off of hundreds of units of insulin in days to weeks.  He's one of my favorite stories. Is a very recent one, a young gal, but who had an almost 20 year, history of type 2. Diabetes came in. When a physician from another clinic told her she was just sick and should probably get used to it. Her diabetes was way out of control. This despite the fact that she was on multiple medications including almost 300 units of insulin that was being injected into her continuously every day via Apple.  All of this, remember blood sugar still out of control. So we put her on a low-carb diet. And now let's fast-forward four months. She lost weight. Yes, but better than that sick, no more. Her blood sugar levels were now normal. All of the time this on, get this, no diabetes medication, gone was the 300 units of insulin, no more. Insulin pump. No more pricking her finger multiple times each day gone.  All of it. No more diabetes. One of the greatest joys of my job is to be able to tell a patient like this, that they no longer have diabetes and we ceremoniously take it off their problem list together. So, are they cured? Is this a miracle? We'll leave that grandstanding to dr. Oz cured would imply, that it can't come back and if they start eating excessive carbs, again, it will so not cured but they don't have diabetes, any longer. It's  Halt. And it can stay that way as long as we keep away the cause. So what does this look like? Then? How does somebody eat this way? Well first, let me tell you what it's not low carb, is not zero carb and it is not high protein. These are common criticisms that are so frustrating because they're not true next. If we take the carbs out. What are we going to put in? Because remember there's only three macronutrients. If one goes down, one has to go up my patients.  Eat fat and a lot of it, what you say, but what's going to happen when you eat fat? Well, let me tell you, you're going to be happy because that tastes great and it is incredibly satisfying.  But remember, that is the only macronutrient that's going to keep our glucose blood sugar and insulin levels low, and that is so important. So I want you to now hear my simple.\",\n",
       " 'XgnMfVFzI': 'How does insulin and food affect your blood sugar? You are taking two types of insulin. Lantus insulin, you can see in green is a background. Basal insulin and novolog insulin is, you can see in blue is a fast-acting bolus. Insulin.  Lantus insulin is typically given at night around the same time and can last for up to 24 hours. Since Lantus is a basal insulin. It keeps your blood sugars within a healthy range when you are not eating. And While You Were Sleeping, it does not cover for carbohydrates or food NovoLog insulin. You can see in blue. This fast acting. Insulin is also called a bolus insulin. This insulin begins working within 10 to 15 minutes after taking it.  Can usually last for up to 24 hours, but this may vary from person to person.  NovoLog insulin has two functions. It can lower high blood sugars and it can cover carbohydrate grams. NovoLog is given every time you eat carbohydrates to keep your blood sugars within a healthy range carbohydrates found in foods such as fruit, milk grains and sweets, break down to glucose or blood sugar quickly in the body. You can see in red when you eat foods containing carbohydrates. It starts to raise your blood sugar within 10 minutes.  And can peek meaning raising your blood sugar at the highest within 90 minutes. After eating. If you took the correct amount of NovoLog to cover the carbohydrate grams in your meal, your blood sugar should lower to a healthy range within two to four hours.  It is important to remember that you need to take NovoLog insulin before you eat meals or snacks to allow the insulin to work with the carbohydrates and to lower your blood sugar. You also need to eat your meals in less than 30 minutes to make sure the insulin and carbohydrates are working together to keep your blood sugars healthy.',\n",
       " 'C7y9qB3tcA': \"Immune system.  And last but not least people that are physically active live longer.  So when I finished high school, I decided I'm going to turn my hobby exercise into my profession. So I studied exercise science with the goal to work in exercise for rehab and here you have a photo of my previous life in which I worked in exercise for Rehab.  We're doing some stretching.  But I thought, instead of helping people with health conditions. I think it would be more efficient and I could reach a lot more people. If I help preventing health conditions or is this cover here, says, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  And there really seems to be a lot that needs to be done because it's discover here says this really seems to be the shape of things to come.  But maybe this image is closer to the truth because in the last image, the person is just sitting in front of a computer and that's what most of us do. Most of the time these days. I can say that while I'm doing research and I'm also work in front of a computer, most of the day, at least I have a sit stand there. So I can also stand in front of the computer and that's it the whole time.  What the question is?  How much physical activity do we need to get these health benefits? And what intensity should it be? Maybe the message on this gravestone is a bit too simple.  Let's look at what this doctor has to say to his patient.  It's maybe a bit blunt what he says, but there is some truth in that. So let's look at the recommendations, the guidelines of the World Health Organization.  For adults, that is I should first point out. They differentiate between moderate activity and vigorous physical activity, examples of moderate activity would be these two images. Just walking your dog or going for a casual bike ride.  So something that noticeably increases your heart rate, but doesn't make you sweat. And vigorous activity would be something more intense that makes you sweat puff and pant and on a scale from 1 to 10 of exertion would be about a 7 or an 8 and the World Health Organization recommends, that adults should accumulate at least 150 minutes of moderate activity per week. Only to, and  H not a lot or alternatively, 75 minutes of vigorous activity.  Or equivalent combinations of the two. And when they say equivalent, they mean that one minute of vigorous activity counts as much as two minutes of moderate activity because the energy expenditure is about twice as high. So basically these recommendations these amounts of activity are based on the activity energy expenditure.  However, some Studies have found that vigorous activity, is more efficient in inducing cardiorespiratory Fitness than moderate activity independent, of the activity energy expenditure.  And other Studies have found that this cardiorespiratory Fitness is a better predictor of mortality than physical activity. So we thought it might be that. Vigorous activity has health benefits Beyond just the higher energy expenditure.  And we exam this with data from Australia, from the 45 and up study, which is the largest cohort study ever conducted in the southern hemisphere in the state of New South Wales with more than a quarter million, adults, aged 45 and older, who are asked a lot of questions, including the physical activity, where we doubled the minutes in line with the guidelines, vigorous activity. We excluded those adults that were older than 75 because our main  Outcome of Interest. Was preventable early death.  And over six and a half years of follow-up, and more than 7,000 of the participants passed away.  And here's what we found. I have two slides with the main findings. So on this slide, you can see depending on how much physical activity people did what was their risk for an early death? And the left column here is the zero of those that didn't do any activity.  And when we compare, we can see that those that did at least some activity, but less than the recommended two and a half hours, at a huge risk reduction for an early death of 34 percent and those that did meet the activity guidelines of two and a half hours, had a risk reduction of almost half. And those that achieve twice, the recommended amount had a risk reduction of 54 percent. So huge differences.  This slide looks at whether this energy expenditure came, just from moderate activity, which is our reference category here on the left. So people who did do activity but only moderate activity, which was by the way, more than half, our of our sample and we compare with those that did some but less than 30% of their activity through vigorous activity. And those that did even more than that more than 30% of their energy expenditure for vigorous activity.  And we can see we get an additional risk reduction of 9% compared to those that didn't do any vigorous activity for those that it some vigorous activity and a 13 percent risk reduction for those that did quite a lot of vigorous activity.  But we think of the risk reductions that we saw for those that do any activity. Even if it's just moderate activity, which were huge. Then we can think of this as the cake, the additional benefits from some. Vigorous activity would be the icing on top of that cake.  And I want findings actually are not in line with those physical activity, guidelines, because we found as we have prophesized at the beginning that vigorous activity has health benefits Beyond just the higher energy expenditure. So a media release was issued by James Cook University and we were pretty Blown Away by how much our article was covered in the media around the world. So we got into the London Times.  New York Times. Japan times Forbes Magazine, hands post. So, really only prestigious media Outlets. This one is a Brazilian News website. You can see the instructor. Looks like he's almost naked there.  And it definitely looks very vigorous and talking about nudity. I have to say the Pinnacle of our media coverage really proud to announce. That was when we heard through the media up Department. We got into the Playboy magazine.  Thank you.  And the media Department told us that through playboy.com alone. We reached more than 28 million people. I mean, 28 million men and all together. I couldn't believe it. They said that just the websites alone that featured. Our article had more than 1.1 billion unique visitors. So the message really got out which was fantastic.  However, unfortunately, some of the media reported things that we didn't really find in our study will get gentle exercise. You need to get hot and sweaty to live longer. That's not what we found. As I said, even just moderate activity, gives you huge benefits when it comes to longevity.  So there was a bit of miscommunication there, unfortunately.  Another anecdote about the media coverage was. I had some radio interviews and in one of these live radio interviews, this woman asked me. So, can you give us some examples for vigorous activity? And I gave some examples and then she asked me, what about horizontal folk dancing? And I remember I was sitting there with the phone thinking. Hmm, English is not my mother tongue. I haven't come across this expression before. Well, I guess I know what she means. And I said, oh, well, absolutely sex can be  Vigorous depending on position and other factors, but it was a Morning Show on the radio, so I didn't want to go into details too much.  So what are the implications of our study? First of all, we would say.  That our findings indicate that vigorous activity has benefits Beyond just the higher energy expenditure and that future physical activity. Guidelines to continue to say that moderate activities, great for us, but should maybe point out more the additional benefits that we can all get out of vigorous activity. And for all of you, the take-home message would be in, not doing any physical activity. Would be great if you could start doing some activity, even if  It's just moderate activity, like going for a brisk walk. And for those of you who are ready pretty active, but just doing moderate activity. It would be great. You could get an additional benefit out of it. If you also did at least a little bit of vigorous activity. Even if it's just 20, 30 minutes per week, which isn't much. Thank you.\",\n",

       " 'G519dFVNs': 'High blood pressure or hypertension is a common condition in which the force of Blood on the walls of your arteries is often too high.  Arteries are the blood vessels that carry blood away from your heart to supply, your tissues with oxygen and nutrients.  In your heart, two chambers called, ventricles contract with each heartbeat to push blood to your lungs, and through your arteries to your body.  As blood flows through them, three main factors affect the pressure on your artery walls. The first is cardiac output or the amount of blood. Your ventricles push out of your heart. Each minute, your blood pressure goes up as cardiac output increases.  The second Factor affecting, your blood pressure is blood volume or the total amount of blood in your body. Blood pressure also goes up as blood volume increases,  The third factor that affects your blood pressure is resistance, which is anything working against the blood flow through your arteries. Several factors, contribute to resistance, R1 resistance factor is the flexibility of your artery wall.  Healthy arteries, expand with each heartbeat to help reduce blood pressure on the wall.  Another resistance factor is the diameter of your arteries. Your body is able to increase the diameter of your arteries to lower your blood pressure.  Or reduce the diameter to raise your blood pressure.  A third resistance factor is blood viscosity or thickness in your blood, more particles, such as proteins and fat increase viscosity. If your blood is thicker, your blood pressure goes up as your heart Works harder to push it through your arteries.  Your blood pressure can be measured with a device called a sphygmomanometer or blood pressure cuff.  When your heart beats, the pressure of Blood on the walls of your arteries is called systolic pressure.  When your heart relaxes between beats pressure on the artery wall is called diastolic pressure.  While your blood pressure, may change throughout the day. It should normally be less than 120 millimeters of mercury for systolic pressure and less than 80 millimeters of mercury, for diastolic pressure. If your systolic pressure frequently stays above 140 or your diastolic pressure frequently stays above 90. You have high blood pressure.  Overtime, high blood pressure will damage the walls of your arteries.  Your artery wall. May become weak and form an enlargement called an aneurysm, or the wall May burst.  And bleed into the surrounding tissue.  Small tears in your artery wall. May attract certain substances in your blood such as cholesterol, fat and calcium to form a buildup called a plaque.  Blood flow through your artery decreases as the plaque and larges.  Blood cells can stick to the plaque and form, solid clumps called cloths, further reducing or completely blocking your blood flow.  Damage to your arteries, raises your blood pressure, even more by making your heart beat more forcefully, Artery damage and reduced blood flow. Lead to conditions such as a stroke.  Heart attack.  Or kidney disease.  In most cases the cause of high blood pressure or hypertension is unknown. This type of high blood pressure is called primary or essential hypertension.  Treatment for essential hypertension includes Lifestyle Changes such as eating a healthy diet.  If you are sensitive to the sodium in salt, your doctor May recommend limiting your intake of salt and highly processed foods.  Sodium may cause your body to retain water, which increases both your blood volume and your blood pressure.  Other lifestyle changes that can reduce blood pressure, include avoiding, excessive alcohol intake.  Getting regular exercise.  Losing weight. If you are overweight.  And quitting smoking.  Your doctor may also recommend medications that act on your kidneys blood vessels.  Or heart to help reduce your blood pressure.  Diuretics. Commonly called water pills cause your kidneys to move more salt and water from your blood into your urine, which reduces your blood volume and pressure.  Beta blockers. Reduce the workload on your heart. By decreasing, both the rate of your heartbeat and the strength of your hearts contractions.  Several types of drugs act directly or indirectly to reduce your blood pressure by relaxing, your blood vessels, which increases their diameter.  These drugs include ACE, inhibitors Angiotensin, 2 receptor blockers, calcium channel, blockers and direct-acting vasodilators.',\n",
       " 'KYxRDO2G_0': \"This happened a few years ago when I was a child, I would eat junk food every single day. I didn't eat much healthy food. I would eat chips soda candy anything you can think of that involves sugar. My mom told me every day. I shouldn't be doing this. I should eat some healthy stuff often, but I just ignored her and continued eating food a few years passed and that's when we went to the hospital because I couldn't really hear much for my ear. So he went to the hospital. For them to check it out.  So when we went there the nurse wanted to check my blood sugar. So she did when she poked my finger was kind of hurt, but I was fine with it when she came back. She had a serious face on her. She looked at me and looked at my mom and said that I have diabetes. So my mom was scared you could tell in her face that she was worried for me. I didn't know what that maybe this was all I knew is that one of my aunt's had it the doctor said that diabetes is when you cannot make  Called insulin that kind of balances your blood sugar. I have to take medication medicine that was insulin. I have to put it in myself with a shot. I don't like shots syringes anything that involved the needle I would just just cry. I don't like needles at all. It was scary knowing that I had to get shot every single day. Check my blood sugar every single day every single day. All I see is a needle in front of me. It's scary whenever I eat have to put a shot on  my people look at me whenever we're at restaurants like oh my God, look at that girl. She's putting a shot on. Whoa. What the heck? Um, it's kind of nerve-wracking. My mom told me that I have to start eating healthy. I can't really eat that much junk food anymore. And that kind of well made me sad I was like, wow, I can't eat no more junk food. No more ice cream. Candy. What am I gonna do with my life? No LM ever gonna see these greens.  After a few years I kind of got used to the shots, but I am still not used to the blood tests. I'm kind of fine with diabetes now. It's still kind of scary that knowing diabetes. If I don't take care of myself. I might hurt myself. It could damage me. I might die. I try my best to just live on act normally just like everyone else but with friends do whatever normal people could do, but I just want to say take care of your body and just be careful.

       " 'KvHrD1eS4': \"Me and right now when you and this is vital to all life because it's not just how cells acquire what they need and get rid of what they don't. It's also how cells communicate with one another different materials have different ways of crossing the cell membrane and there are basically two categories of ways. There's active transport and there's passive transport. Passive transport doesn't require any energy, which is great because important things like oxygen and water can use this to get into cells really easily and they do this through what we call diffusion. Let's say, I'm finally in this show and I'm in the show.  With my brother John some of you know, my brother John and I love him but he is not a big fan of people. I mean, he likes people he doesn't like big crowds being parts of big crowds of people standing nearby him breathing on him, touching him, accidentally that sort of thing. Because John's with me at the show, we're hanging out with all of our friends new stage, but then he starts moving further and further from the stage. So he doesn't get a lunch a hipsters and creating a space. That's basically what diffusion is if everyone in the club were John,  They would try and get as much space between all of them as possible until it was a uniform mass of John Green throughout the club. When oxygen gets crowded. It finds places that are less crowded and moves into those spaces. When water gets graded. It does the same thing and moves to where there's less water. When water does this across a membrane. It's a kind of diffusion called osmosis. This is how your cells regulate their water content. Not only does this apply to water itself, which as we've discussed, is the world's best solvent. You going to learn more about water and our water episode.  It also works with water that contains dissolved materials or Solutions, like Solutions, salt, water, or Solutions of sugar water or booze which is just a solution of ethanol and water. If the concentration of a solution is higher inside of itself that it is outside of the cell and that solution is called hypertonic like Bauer thirst. It's got everything packed into it. And if the concentration inside of the cell is lower than outside of the cell, it's called hypotonic which is sort of a sad version of hypertonic. So like we Charlie Sheen we don't want the crazy.  Panic Charlie Sheen. We don't like the super sad depressed. Charlie Sheen. We want the in the middle Charlie Sheen. Who can just make us laugh and be happy? And that is the state that water concentrations are constantly seeking, it's called isotonic. When the concentration is the same on both sides outside a name and this works in real life. We can actually show it to you. This father is full of fresh water. And we also have a sausage casing, which is actually made out of cellulose. And inside of that. We have salt water. We've dyed it so that you can see it move through the casing, which is acting as our membrane this time.  It's shows how over a few hours. The salt water diffuses into the pure water. It'll keep diffusing until the concentration of salt in the water is the same inside the membrane as outside. We want to does this attempting to become isotonic. It's called moving across its concentration, gradient. Most of my sales right now are bathed in a solution that has the same concentration as inside of them. And this is important. For example, if you took one of my red blood cells and put it in a glass of pure water, it would be so hypertonic. So much stuff would be in the cell compared to outside the cell that water would rush.  Into the red blood cell and it would literally explode, so we don't want that. But if the concentration of my blood plasma were too high, all the water would rush out of my cell and it would shrivel up and be useless. That's why your kidneys are constantly on the job. Regulating the concentration of your blood plasma to keep it isotonic. Now water can permeate a cell membrane without any help, but it's not actually particularly easy as we discussed in the last episode cell, membranes are made out of phospholipids and the phospholipid. Bilayer is hydrophilic or water-loving on the outside and hydrophobic or water.  Water hating on the inside. So water molecules have a hard time passing through these layers because they get stuck at the nonpolar. Hydrophobic core that is where the channel proteins come in, allow passage of stuff like water and ions without using any energy. They straddle the width of the membrane and inside they have channels that are hydrophilic, which draws the water through the proteins that are specifically for channeling water are called aquaporins. Each one. Can pass three billion water molecules. A second makes me have to pee just thinking about it to things like oxygen and water that  Need constantly, they can get into the cell without any energy necessary. But most chemicals, they use, what's called active transport. This is, especially useful. If you want to move something in the opposite direction of its concentration, gradient from a low concentration to a high concentration. So say we're back at that show and I'm keeping company with John, he's being all antisocial and his polite and Charming way, but after half a beer and an argument about, who's the best Doctor Who I want to get back to my friends across the crowded bar. So I've transport myself against the concentration, gradient.  Of human spending, a lot of energy dodging, stomping feet, throwing an elbow to get to them. That is high energy, transport in a Cell. Getting the energy necessary to do, pretty much anything, including moving something, the wrong direction across its concentration, gradient requires ATP, ATP adenosine triphosphate. You just want to replay that over and over again until it rolls off the tongue because it's one of the most important chemicals that you will ever.  Ever ever hear about adenosine, triphosphate ATP. If our bodies were America, ATP, would be credit cards. It's such an important form of information currency that we're going to do an entire separate episode about it, which will be here, the going to the wrong direction, but it will be here when we've done it. But for now, here's what you need to know when a cell requires active transport. It basically has to pay a fee in the form of ATP to a transport protein. Particularly important kind of freaking sweet transport protein is called  The sodium potassium pump most cells have them but they're especially vital to cells. That need lots of energy, like muscle cells and brain cells by hola graffiti. It's my favorite part of the show. Sodium potassium pump was discovered in the 1950s by a Danish medical doctor named Yen's. Christian School, who was studying how anesthetics work on? Membranes. He noticed that there was a protein in cell membranes.  Could pump sodium out of the cell and the way he got to know, this bump was by studying the nerves of crabs because crab nerves are huge compared to humans nerves and are easier to dissect and observe but crabs are still small. So he needed a lot of them. He struck a deal with a local fisherman and over the years studied approximately 25,000 crabs, Each of, which he boiled to study their fresh nerve fibers. He published his findings on the sodium. Potassium pump in 1957.  7 and in the meantime became known for the distinct odor. That filled the halls of the Department of physiology. At the University where he worked 40 years after making his Discovery School was awarded, the Nobel Prize in chemistry. And here's what he taught us turns out these pumps work against two gradients. At the same time. One is the concentration gradient and the other is the electrochemical gradient. That's the difference in electrical charge on either side of a cell's membrane. So then ourselves that school was studying, like nerve cells in your brain. Typically have a negative charge inside.  To the outside. They also usually have a low concentration of sodium, ions inside the pump, works against both of these conditions collecting three positively charged sodium, ions and pushing them out into the positively charged, sodium, ion, Rich, environment to get the energy to do this. The protein pump, breaks up a molecule of ATP, ATP adenosine, triphosphate and adenosine molecule with three phosphate groups attached to it. So when I TP connects with the protein pump, an enzyme breaks, the covalent bond on one of those phosphates in a burst of the  Excitement and energy. The split releases enough energy to change the shape of the pump, so that it opens outward and releases, three sodium ions. This new shape also makes it a good fit for potassium ions that are outside the cells. So the pump, let's two of those in. So what you wind up with is a nerve cell that is literally and metaphorically charged. It has all those sodium ions waiting outside with this intense desire to get inside of the cell. And when something triggers the nerve cell, it lets all of those in. And that gives the nerve cell, a bunch of electrochemical energy, which can then use to help you feel things.  Touch or smell or taste or have a thought. There are still yet another way that stuff gets inside of cells, and this also requires energy. It's also a form of active transport. It's called vesicular transport. And the heavy lifting is done by vesicles which are tiny sacs made of phospholipids. Just like the cell membrane. This kind of active transport is also called cytosis from the Greek for cell action. When vesicles transport materials outside of a cell, it's called exocytosis or outside cell action, a great example of this is going on in your brain right now.  It's how your nerve cells release neurotransmitters. You've heard of neurotransmitters. They are very important in helping you feel different ways, like dopamine, and serotonin after neurotransmitters are synthesized and packaged into vesicles. They're transported until the vesicle reaches the membrane. When that happens, the two bilayers rearrange. So that they fuse and then the neurotransmitter spills out. And now I remember where I left my keys. I'll just play that process in reverse and you'll see how material gets inside the cell and that's endocytosis. There are three different ways that this happens. My personal favorite.  His phagocytosis and they all some, their begins with the fact that that name itself means devouring cell action. Check this out. So this particle outside here is some kind of dangerous bacteria in your body. And this is a white, blood cell chemical receptors on the blood cell membrane detect this Punk, Invader, and attached to it actually reaching out around it and engulfing it. Then the membrane forms, a vesicle to carry it inside, where it lays a total Unholy, beat down on it with enzymes and other cool weapons.  The pinocytosis or drinking action is very similar to figure cytosis, except instead of surrounding whole particles. It just surrounds things that have already been dissolved here. The membrane just folds in a little to form the beginning of a channel and then pinches off to form a vesicle that holds the fluid. Most of your cells are doing this right now because it's how our cells, absorb nutrients. What if a cell needs something that only occurs in very small concentrations. That's when cells use clusters of specialized receptor proteins in the membrane that form a vesicle when receptors connect with the  People that they're looking for. For example, your cells have specialized cholesterol receptors that allow you to absorb cholesterol, if those receptors don't work which can happen with some genetic conditions, cholesterol is left to float around in your blood and eventually causes heart disease. So that's just one of many reasons to appreciate what's called receptor-mediated endocytosis. Hey Roger, made it into now comes review time.

       " 'qsvwHG9c-M': \"Healthy diet and exercising. And let me start with telling you the story of Jung. At least I will call him John. So, John was a boy who grew up in the Netherlands and he was born in a farmer's family, and he seemed to be a normal, baby.  The only remarkable thing was that he was always crying.  He was always hungry actually within five minutes. After finishing his bottle of milk. He was hungry again. And by the time he was eating solid food. He was eating night and day and he was craving for food. Always. And by the time he was three years old. He was massively obese.  And at that point, his mother put locks on all the kitchen cupboards, but still he was craving and he was looking in trash cans and he was looking for even Frozen. He's eating even frozen food.  Well, all these years, his mother sends, there was something wrong with her boy cuz her other child would thin.  So, she went to doctors and she asked for advice, but she basically told her that she's just feeding her boy too much and she felt like being blamed, for being a bad mother. She got frustrated. And at some point, she get referred to the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, and she saw their, my colleague, Erica for Nano occur. Who's a pediatrician, and she found that John?  Hadn't genetic abnormality in his hunger hormone system that mc4 receptor defect. What that basically means that he had never defeating of satiety. He was never full. So this diagnosis was really important for Jonathan's mother because they really suffered from the stigma because they were accused of having a weak character.  And after dead school social networks, they started to support John and his mother and actually for a while his weight stabilized.  And he's now young adults and he I see him as a doctor in Maya, patient clinic, and he is still struggling with obesity and currently, Medical Treatments are under development for patients, like John, so I hope to help being able to help in medical way in the near future.  And you would think, well, this is rare. What would its true? The only two percent of obese. People are carrying in a genetic abnormality that mc4 receptor, like John, but there are other genetic variants with making you much more, hungry or decrease your metabolism. So, if you see someone eating extremely much, maybe we, we should think twice before judging.  So it can be in your genes and genes affect your hunger hormones. But did you realize that? Also crash Diet. Also affect your hunger hormones?  Very low. Calorie diets can also influence your hunger hormones and increase them in the short-term crash diets. They work they reduce your weight. But the problem is that then your hunger hormones will increase. And also, you heard satiety hormones will decrease well, satiety hormone harder, hormones would make you feel full. We always think it's stretch on the stomach that you feel full but that's only part of the story. Actually. It's  Got giving a signal or hormonal, hormonal signal to the brain, telling you, you're full and then you stop eating. So when this signals not adequately being being provided to the brain, you automatically eat more. So basically after a crash diet, you're more hungry and that's even. So in the long term. It has been shown that even your year after diet, a very low, calorie diet still do hunger. Hormones are higher. So what about conscious choice?  Or Foods or having a weak character to buy a lot of the biology is telling you to eat more.  And we're thing is your basal metabolism is also being decreased by a crash diet. So basically you are more hungry, but you burn not not that much calories as she used to do. Well, that's the perfect prescription, of course to regain your weight. And that's what we call the yo-yo effect. We know how it works now. So basically crash dieting is another risk factor for obesity.  So food can also affect your hunger hormones, but also your thoughts.  So let's do a small experiment here. Imagine a box in front of you.  And in this box there, chocolates.  They're white chocolate brown. Chocolate store shiny.  You smell the chocolate right now.  And imagine you're taking what one, you're taking one of the chocolates. Right now. You take a crunchy bite and now you start feeling, you taste the soft sweet pearline and chocolate in your mouth right now.  You are making hunger hormones right at this moment.  Unless you just had dinner, but that means when we go out now for food and we see sweet, we are much more likely to choose the chocolate or sweet Foods rather than a nice green salad of which, you know, it's much more healthy to eat. So this choice of food is not that conscious. As we think it is your, beloved biology is driven it by your you're thinking in the food industry, perfectly notes.  Is they used to advertising and all this visual stimuli stimulate also, our hunger hormones, making us eating differently than we. Maybe think it's good for us.  But you can also benefit from it. Actually. It's the solution also for obesity because we know saying, well, eat last, that's not working. But what is effective is changing your thoughts by cognitive behavioral therapy programs, that's effective. So I told, you know, about biology and hunger hormones, but there are other factors in our environment, which affects the amount of food we eat. Well, for example, how  Our social cultural backgrounds. We know that in some cultures, cultures eating and food is Hospitality. So imagine that your neighbor has stood in the kitchen for three days, cooking a delicious meal for you and invite you over. Well, it's socially not really acceptable not to eat a lot then and to just take a but tiny bit. So also your culture background, May determine the amount of food you eat.  And things have changed in the last decade. In the past decade. We became much more stressed. And if you are stressed, we know your body is producing any more stress for most unusual, in particular, the stress hormone, cortisol of your stress, for a prolonged period of time. And we know if you have extremely high levels of stress hormone, that makes you fat abdominal fat, mass will increase.  But it will also increase your appetite in particular, your appetite for calorie rich food. So that's maybe why we grab a candy bar when we are stressed.  And we don't know exactly what's causing. What actually because this sugar-rich food seem also to stimulate our stress hormones.  So we found our team and also others found that obese people have higher levels of the stress hormone. So maybe when you're Beast, you get in a vicious circle of having elevated. Stress hormone cortisol, simulating the the calorie rich food and that, in its turn stimulates again, your stress hormones. So, psychological stress can stimulate can stimulate your cortisol, but also specific foods and in particular also drinks like alcohol, we know Oak was induced.  An increase of your stress hormones, making increasing your abdominal fat, Mass.  But there's more, which is affecting your stress hormones. And that's sleep in the past decades, with increase of obesity. We also reduce the numbers of hours. We sleep, and a lack of sleep is also activating our stress system, increasing our cortisol, but also this regulating other appetite hormones. So, the net effect of reduced numbers of hours of sleep is weight gain and leading to obesity. So the solution here for obesity.  All solutions, may be to reduce your stress level and also to improve your sleep hours.  And there's more.  In this world, nowadays, we take a lot of medications.  I will tell you the story of Mary Mary. Was it 20 year old young woman who came to my outpatient clinic? Because she gained weight and she gained actually a lot of weight. She gained 20 pounds within 10 weeks and she didn't understand why and she entered my room sit down and she started crying because she was eating very healthy, and she was exercising every day.  And a reason she was. So sad was actually, because she was a lifestyle coach for self. So, she was actually telling people how to eat healthy and how to exercise well, and now she felt that her clients didn't trust her anymore as being good lifestyle coach because she was gaining weight herself.  And after some testing of an did, she had received a corticosteroid injection in her knee because she had a knee problem because she was exercising, very actively. And we know that corticosteroids are an artificial version of your stress hormones. And remember your stress hormones, increase your abdominal fat.  And may also increase your appetite.  And so she suffered from a really extreme side effect of medication. And actually this is rare. I mean this this I see only a few\",\n",

Deaconess Medical Center. They collected neck fat from volunteers brought that fat into a Jocelyn. Up and performed. A number of studies confirming, that it was, in fact, Brown fat. And then we said, can we take the precursor Brown fat cells from within the tissue? Can we grow more and are these going to be functional? Because ultimately if you want to use this tissue to treat metabolic disease, you have to be able to grow them. The team was successful growing. New Brown fat cells in the lab and stimulating them to act like brown fat found within the body. Other labs have isolated and grown Brown fat cells in the lab before. But nobody  She has ever demonstrated until this point that these cells are truly functional. And that's the evidence that we show in this newspaper, being able to grow functional Brown fat cells in the lab will help researchers in creating Brown fat, stimulating drugs, to assist in the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes.

       " 'E1myFSlpy-A': \"Chronic, kidney disease is a broad term that includes subtle decreases in kidney function. That develop over a minimum of three months.  In contrast, acute kidney injury refers to any decrease in kidney function, that happens in less than 3 months.  Now, the kidneys job is to regulate what's in the blood. So they might remove waste, or make sure electrolyte levels are steady or regulate the overall amount of water and they even make hormones. The bottom line is that the kidneys do a ton of stuff.  Blood gets into the kidney, through the renal artery. And once inside, it goes to Tiny clumps of arterioles called glomeruli where it's initially filtered.  And the filtrate, which is the stuff that gets filtered out, moves into the renal tubule.  The rate at which this filtration process takes place is known as the glomerular, filtration rate, or GFR.  In a normal healthy person. This is somewhere around 100 to 120. Milliliters of fluid filtered per minute per 1.73, meters squared of body surface area.  This value is slightly less in women than men and it decreases slowly and all of us as we grow older.  One of the most common causes of chronic kidney disease has hypertension in hypertension, the walls of arteries supplying, the kidneys start to thicken in order to withstand the pressure and that results in a narrow Lumen. A narrow. Lumen means less blood and oxygen gets delivered to the kidney, which leads to ischemic injury to the nephrons glomerulus.  I mean, sounds like, macrophages in fat-laden, macrophages called foam cells slip into the damaged glomerulus and start secreting growth factors like transforming growth factor beta, 1, or tgf-beta 1.  These growth factors caused the mesangial cells to regress back to their more immature. Stem cell state known as mesangial blasts. And then those mesangial blast secrete. Extracellular structural Matrix.  The successive extracellular Matrix leads to glomerulosclerosis, which is hardening and scarring. Which diminishes the nephrons ability to filter the blood and over time. This leads to chronic kidney disease.  The second most common cause of chronic kidney disease is diabetes. In this situation, excess glucose in the Blood starts sticking to proteins a process called non enzymatic. Glycation because no enzymes are involved.  This process of glycation, particularly affects the efferent arteriole and causes it to get stiff and more narrow a process called hyaline arteriolosclerosis.  This creates an obstruction that makes it difficult for blood to leave the glomerulus and increases pressure within the glomerulus which leads to hyperfiltration essentially pushing more fluid through.  In response to this high pressure State, the support of mesangial cells, secrete more and more structural Matrix, which expands the size of the glomerulus.  Over many years, this process of glomerulosclerosis. Once again, diminishes the nephrons ability to filter the blood and can lead to chronic kidney disease.  Although diabetes and hypertension are responsible for the vast majority of chronic kidney disease cases. There are other causes as well including systemic diseases, like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, which can also cause glomerulosclerosis. Other causes though include infections like HIV as well. As long term use of medications like NSAIDs and toxins like the ones in tobacco.  Now normally urea in the blood gets excreted in the urine when there's a decreased glomerular, filtration rate less urea gets filtered out and therefore it has nowhere else to go besides the blood and so it builds up in the blood which is a condition called AZT Mia. He's at emia can cause General symptoms like nausea and loss of appetite. But as urea levels, really build up that can affect the functioning of the central nervous system causing encephalopathy this resultant asterixis.  Tremor of the hand that kind of resembles a bird flapping, its wings, and is best seen when a person attempts to extend their wrists further, accumulation can even progress a coma and death.  This build-up can also cause pericarditis, which is inflammation of the lining of the heart.  In addition, there can also be increased tendency for bleeding since access urea and the blood makes platelets less likely to stick to each other. And so there's less clot formation.  Finally in some cases. Someone can develop uremic Frost where urea crystals can deposit in the skin and they look like powdery snow flakes.  In addition to getting rid of waste, the kidneys played an important role in electrolyte balance. Potassium levels are particularly important and normally the kidney helps with potassium excretion in chronic kidney disease, though, just like with urea less potassium is excreted and so more builds up in the blood and this leads to hyperkalemia, which can be problematic because it can cause cardiac arrhythmias.  Another key role of the kidneys relates to balancing calcium levels. Normally the kidney helps to activate vitamin D, which then helps to increase absorption of calcium from the diet with chronic kidney disease though. There's less activated vitamin D. So less calcium is absorbed into the blood, which results in hypocalcemia low calcium levels.  As calcium levels in the blood fall. Parathyroid hormone is released which causes the bones to lose calcium.  Over time this resorption of calcium from the bones leaves them weakened brittle a condition known as renal osteodystrophy.  The kidneys also released key hormones, for example, normally when the kidneys start sensing a lower than normal amount of fluid getting filtered. They respond by releasing the hormone, renin to increase the blood pressure.  In chronic kidney disease, the falling glomerular filtration rate leads to more and more reading secretion which leads to hypertension. Now remember that hypertension is a cause of chronic kidney disease itself. So this creates quite the Vicious Cycle.  Finally, the kidney also secretes the hormone erythropoietin, which stimulates the production of red blood cells, from the bone marrow in chronic kidney disease, erythropoietin levels fall and this leads to lowered production of red blood cells and ultimately anemia.  The diagnosis of chronic kidney disease comes down to looking at changes in the glomerular, filtration rate over time.  Chronic, kidney disease. Might be suspected with a GF are of less than 90 ml per minute per 1.73 meter squared.  Irreversible kidney damage might happen with the GFR below. 60 milliliters per minute per 1.73 meter squared.  To confirm the diagnosis of kidney biopsy. Can be done to look for changes like glomerulosclerosis.  Treatment for chronic kidney disease, often involves managing the underlying cause in severe situations dialysis or a kidney transplant, might be needed. All right, as a quick recap, chronic kidney disease is when the glomerular filtration rate Falls below. 90 ml per minute or 1.73 meter squared over at least three months. Chronic kidney disease is mainly caused by diabetes and hypertension and complications include.  Abnormalities toxin build-up hypertension and weak bones.  What's happening guys Tanner here.

Such as eight hundred, two 1800 calories per day, meal plans, diabetes meal, planning and tips and tricks. And there are also tons of diabetes friendly recipes for everyone.  But while some risk factors associated with pre-diabetes, may be debated. There is some consensus among many in the medical field on some of those. What I'm going to give you today is a list of risk factors compiled by a group of doctors, dieticians and researchers for a presentation and later published in article form in medical news today. This is a very recent compilation and I feel as very well done. I have long advocated that there is  Genetic component to diabetes. And that is becoming more clear in many of the recent research. I have done, many factors can contribute to the development of prediabetes, increasingly, a link between genetics family, history. And pre-diabetes has been identified, however, inactivity and excess belly fat are considered to be the most common and influential causes of pre-diabetes and type 2. Here. Are some risk factors.  Ders for prediabetes, they include being overweight or obese. The more fatty tissue that is present the less sensitive to glucose, the cells become excess fat around the abdominal region for women away sighs over. 35 inches is linked to a higher prevalence of prediabetes for men. A waist size over 40 inches is considered a risk age. Pre-diabetes can develop an anyone of any age but the risk  Is thought to rise after the age of 45 years. Diet excess carbohydrates, especially sweetened Foods or beverages can impair insulin sensitivity over time diets. High in red or processed. Meats are also linked at times to development of pre-diabetes sleep patterns. People with obstructive sleep, apnea, have an increased risk of developing pre-diabetes, family history.  Having an immediate relative with type 2 significantly can increase the risk of developing pre-diabetes stress during periods of stress. The body, releases the hormone cortisol into the bloodstream, this raises blood glucose levels, people who experience, long-term stress, may have Cushing's syndrome which can cause diabetes.  Gestational diabetes women who give birth to babies waiting nine pounds, or more may be at a higher risk. For pre-diabetes women, who develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy and their children are also at a higher risk, polycystic, ovary syndrome, some women with PCOS are more susceptible to insulin resistance, which can lead to pre diabetes or type 2.  Ethnicity, the risk of developing pre-diabetes tends to be higher for African-Americans. Native Americans, Hispanics, Pacific, Islanders and asian-americans. The reason remains unclear metabolic syndrome when the impact of obesity, high blood pressure, high levels of triglycerides and low levels of HDL, combine insulin resistance can occur.

       " '1sXgd5ui8': \"Is the Zona fasciculata is the middle Zone and also the widest Zone and it takes up the majority of the volume of the whole adrenal gland.  The ACTH specifically stimulate cells in this Zone to secrete cortisol, which belongs to a class of steroids or lipid soluble hormones called glucocorticoids.  Glucocorticoids are not soluble in water. So most cortisol in the blood is bound to a special carrier protein called cortisol, binding globulin. And only about five percent is Unbound or free.  In fact, only this small fraction of free. Cortisol is biologically active and it's levels are carefully controlled.  Excess free. Cortisol is filtered in the kidneys and dumped into the urine.  Free cortisol in the blood is involved in a bunch of stuff and it's part of the Circadian rhythm.  Cortisol levels peak in the morning, when the body knows we need to get up and go and then drop at night when we're getting ready for bed.  In times of stress, the body needs to have plenty of energy substrates around.  So cortisol increases gluconeogenesis, which is the synthesis of new glucose molecules as well as proteolysis, which is the breakdown of protein and lipolysis, which is the breakdown of fat.  Cortisol also helps to maintain the blood pressure by increasing the sensitivity of peripheral. Blood vessels to catecholamines, like epinephrine and norepinephrine and this Narrows the blood vessel Lumen cortisol. Also helps to dampen the inflammatory and immune response by reducing the production and release of inflammatory mediators, like prostaglandins, and interleukins as well as inhibiting. The proliferation of T lymphocytes.  Finally, cortisol receptors are present in the brain where they're full effect is still actually unclear but might influence things like mood and memory.  For all this to work properly though, the levels of free cortisol have to stay within the normal range, to do that. The body uses negative feedback, which means that high levels of cortisol, tell the hypothalamus and pituitary gland to decrease their secretion of crh and ACTH respectively.  Less crh also tells the pituitary gland to make less ACTH. So the pituitary gland ends up having two reasons not to make ACTH with less. ACTH floating around. The zone of fasciculation, gets less stimulation to make cortisol and eventually cortisol levels. Go back down to the normal range again.  In Cushing syndrome, cortisol levels are constantly higher than normal. So its effects are exaggerated excess. Cortisol leads to severe muscle bone and skin breakdown which are the major protein stores to the body.  It also leads to elevated blood glucose levels and that leads to high insulin levels.  Insulin among its many actions preferentially targets adipocytes or fat cells in the center of the body around the waist in buttocks.  In those cells, the insulin activates lipoprotein lipase, which is an enzyme that helps those adipocytes accumulate more fat molecules. The result is central obesity.  In addition to this, the high cortisol levels cause hypertension, and this is for two reasons. First, they amplify the effect of catecholamines on blood vessels, and second cortisol starts cross reacting with mineralocorticoid receptor, 's, which normally only bind a related, steroid hormone mineralocorticoid, which are secreted from the Zona glomerulosa layer of the adrenal cortex.  In other words because the cortisol is structurally, similar to mineralocorticoid. It can bind to that receptor and it can trigger the mineralocorticoid effect, which is mainly to increase blood pressure by retaining fluid.  High levels of cortisol. Also inhibit the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone from the hypothalamus which messes up normal ovarian and testicular function excess. Cortisol. Also dampens the inflammatory and immune response, making individuals, more susceptible to infections.  Finally high levels of cortisol seem to impair normal brain function, but the exact mechanism here is unclear.  Cushing syndrome can happen because of exhaustion is cortisol. Meaning that it comes from outside, usually in the form of medications, but it can also happen because of endogenous cortisol. Meaning that the excess cortisol is made by the body.  The majority of cases of Cushing's syndrome happen in individuals, using exoticness steroid medications over a long period of time often to treat autoimmune and inflammatory disorders like asthma or rheumatoid arthritis.  That's because the molecular structure of exhaustion is steroid medication is so similar to the cortisol that they mimic its actions on various tissues.  In fact, exoticness, steroid medication can also cause negative feedback on the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland.  This causes a decrease in crh and ACTH, which in turn shuts down cortisol production from the zone of fascicular Lata.  Over time, this lack of stimulation can cause the Zona fasciculata to physically shrink or become atrophic.  Since that's the widest part of the adrenal cortex. It can have a measurable effect on the overall size of the adrenal gland.  Even though this results in less endogenous cortisol production. It still doesn't quite compensate for the huge levels of exogenous cortisol. And that causes Cushing syndrome to develop in addition to taking exhaustion is steroid medications. Cushing syndrome can also result from increased levels of endogenous cortisol. The most common reason for that is excess, ACTH, the leading cause of that is a pituitary adenoma, which is a benign tumor of the pituitary gland. And this specific condition is called  Disease. The exact reason for the development of this sort of benign tumor isn't known but unlike a malignant tumor the cells don't invade neighboring tissues or spread to other parts of the body instead. The pituitary adenoma, simply grows in size and secretes too much, ACTH.  The excess ACTH over stimulates the Zona fasciculata, both adrenal glands, which grow larger and secrete excess cortisol.  Apart from pituitary. Adenoma is there are ectopic sources of ACTH like small cell, lung cancer and in these cases the excess, ACTH is coming from somewhere other than the pituitary.  Another common cause of endogenous Cushing's syndrome is tumors of the adrenal glands that make excess cortisol, like adrenal adenoma, which are benign tumors and adrenal carcinomas, which are malignant tumors. In both adrenal adenoma has and carcinomas, the cells of the Zona fasciculata within the adrenal. Cortex start dividing abnormally and secrete excess cortisol.  As before the excess, cortisol provides negative feedback to the hypothalamus and pituitary gland suppressing, both crh and ACTH production. Although this doesn't have any effect on the Zona fasciculata, the involved, adrenal gland. Since the neoplastic cells are autonomous meaning that they've grown independent from any stimulatory signals.  Zona fasciculata of the uninvolved normal adrenal gland shrinks and produces less than the standard amount of cortisol. The net result though is still abnormally, high levels of cortisol, and that causes Cushing syndrome to develop.  Regardless of the cause, the symptoms of Cushing's syndrome are directly related to the effects of excess cortisol on its various Target tissues resulting from The increased breakdown of most types of tissue, the individual presents with muscle wasting and thin, extremities skin, thinning. Easy bruising and abdominal striae or lines, as well as fractures due to osteoporosis or brittle bones.  At the same time, there's fat redistribution. So classic findings, include around Full Moon shaped face a buffalo hump, which is a fatty hump on the upper back and truncal obesity or fat gathers around the abdomen and trunk rather than in the limbs.  Finally excess cortisol causes hyperglycemia or high blood sugar levels that can progress to diabetes, mellitus, hypertension or increased blood pressure along with a high risk for cardiovascular disease as well as increased. Vulnerability, to infections or wound, healing, amenorrhea or absent. Menstrual bleeding in psychiatric or mental disturbances.  Diagnosis of Cushing syndrome is initially based on measuring the free or Unbound cortisol. In a 24 hour urine sample in order to assess the total amount of cortisol excreted in the urine over a 24-hour period.  Alternatively, blood or saliva test late at night. Can help check if there's a normal daily rise and fall of cortisol levels.  Another option is also the dexamethasone suppression test, which is when a person, is given a low dose of dexamethasone, which is an exhaustion is steroid. That suppresses, ACTH production in the pituitary gland.  Normally, that should cause a decrease in serum, cortisol levels, but if Cushing's syndrome is caused by endogenous cortisol production, then the serum cortisol levels should remain unchanged.  If that test is positive, the next step is to determine the exact cause of endogenous cortisol production.  And ACTH Plasma levels can be checked.  Low, ACTH levels can be seen in adrenal. Adenoma, has and carcinomas, whereas High, ACTH levels can be seen in Cushing disease and ectopic ACTH production.  If the ACTH level is high, the next step is to give an injection of a high dose of dexamethasone.  Unlike pituitary adenoma has ectopic sites of ACTH Productions. Typically don't respond even to high doses of dexamethasone and the serum cortisol remains high. After all that Imaging can be used an MRI of the pituitary gland in the case of Cushing's Disease, a CT scan of. The adrenals. When had renal pathology is suspected or a CT of the chest abdomen and pelvis, if there seems to be an ectopic site of ACTH production.  Treatment of Cushing's syndrome, depends on the underlying cause if it's due to exogenously medications, then the offending drug is, gradually decreased and eventually stopped if possible. It's important to avoid sudden, steroid withdrawal though, because that can cause an adrenal crisis which is life-threatening. That's because the adrenal glands might be atrophied and might need months to recover fully. And during that time, the body needs the exoticness steroids to function normally.  If Cushing's syndrome is due to a pituitary adenoma like in Cushing disease.\",\n",
       " 'EAuf42kd8Aw': \"So lots of people, see this picture of me and the first thing that they assume is that I bleached my skin and that is 100% not true. So I want to talk to you guys about something that is a side, effect of my weight gain and weight loss, and something that has been presented to me on both social media as well as through email and just questions about the my skin and about the changes that I've seen since losing weight. So when I  First started experiencing the side effects of what. I now know. Is a catharsis nigger? Can't I did not know what it was. I had dark leathery patches around my eyes on my cheekbones, on my neck, on my elbows, my knees, even my Knuckles and I had no idea what it was. The main thing that I wanted to do was to fix the obvious, discoloration in my skin on my face because that was something that was directly affecting me.  So I've tried everything. I tried creams. I tried changing my face, wash. I tried facial scrub. I tried dark spot removers. I tried everything. So, I finally went to see a dermatologist and when I did they told me or she told me that she thought that it was a catharsis nigger cans, and she suggested that I go to, and go and see my normal doctor or my primary care physician to be,  Stood for other, you know, other diseases. And so once I got to my doctor, I actually found out that I was in fact pre-diabetic and that the Aiken ptosis, nigricans was a direct symptom of that. And so I do encourage anybody who is experiencing those types of discoloration or differences in your skin, pay attention because it could be a sign of something more serious for me. Luckily, once I did start to lose the weight.  Discoloration started to fade and my skin started to become normal again. I want to point out that before I gained weight. I, you know, I wasn't this color. So it was an obvious effect of the weight game. It was not something where I bleach my skin or anything like that, to change my color. I started off this color. I turn that color, and now I'm back to my normal color. So I hope that this clears up all of the comments and things that I've been.  Getting on Instagram. And I strongly strongly suggest that if you are experiencing any type of skin issues, you should go and see your doctor because you never know what your body is trying to tell you. Luckily. I never did get to the full-blown stage of diabetes. I was able to prevent it with the weight loss. So again, if you're having any of those types of, you know, reactions in your skin, or you're seeing changes, don't ignore your body is probably trying to tell you something. So thank you guys so much for watching.  Watching and I will see you next week.

       " 'wWLRnX_gc': \"I'm going on a little vacation.  And I never go on vacation without these kids. You never know. Oh, I also always take this. It's a lifesaver and a metaphor.  For this, my glucagon emergency kit, you know, I know how to swim, but even the best swimmers sometimes, get in over their heads. Well, that's where this comes in handy because you never know. Oh, gotta go. I'm here is a cab not a boat. Oh, no, this is just a metaphor for my emergency glucagon kit.  Look at what I have diabetes and I carry it for emergencies. I always have one with me when I travel. Why. That's a good question. First. Stop. My doctor doctor would. What exactly is glucagon? Glucagon is a medication that we use in people with diabetes when they're having a severe low blood glucose. And is it this this stuff that you shooting you? That's not that's not sugar. Now, and one of my former patients used to call it. The glucose gun instead of glucagon.  But now it's not glucose. It's a synthetic version of the natural hormone that our body makes can you demonstrate to me how this works? Sure. You want to do it with me? All right. The good thing about glucagon is that it's a very safe medication and you really cannot hurt somebody with glucagon, even if you gave more than the recommended dose, for example, for a child. It's not going to hurt them. So the first thing you do is you take the vial out and it has a disk of powder and you take the cap off.  Take the syringe and take the cap off, inject, the liquid into the vial of powder, and you want to mix it, shake it up like that until the powder is completely dissolved and the liquid is back to clear. And then keeping the syringe back in the vial. You want to pull the liquid back into your syringe and your dose will depend on your age and your bodyweight. Flick it a couple times to get your bubbles out and then inject the air.  Back into the vial. So you don't have the bubbles, you take it out and then it can be given under the skin or an emergency situation. We recommend directly into the muscle because it's probably absorbed a little bit faster. Grab the skin. Gently like this insert that the needle all the way down to the hub and then in Jack, how you would count to three? So that all of the liquid has a chance to leave the needle and then pull out.  Okay, so you take that syringe, you mix it with that stuff. And why don't you do it yourself? Well, because I was passed out my wife. My 10 year old son found me on, on my bed in the middle of the afternoon and my wife was completely freaked out and she couldn't figure out how to use this glucagon thing. And so my son 10 looked at it, said, Mom. No, you do this and then you do this and squirt that in there and pull that out of there. We put that in dad and  They both together held it against my leg. And push. Push, not afraid of needles. Save me from having to be revived by paramedics and save me from. Who knows what else was the only time I've ever had to use that thing in 39 years, but glad I had it.  Train station. Thank you very much. Keep the change. Hey, tip for you. Don't forget your metaphor, might save your life someday. Hope you never have to use it. Got you. See you.\",\n",

Brigade is retracing a River Highway from the Rocky Mountains to Lake Superior and these  Her highways led to Canada as we know it and it's possible to go from the Rocky Mountains, all the way to the Atlantic. All the way to the Hudson Bay. The fur trade was built on these River. Highways trade goods were brought. In Furs, were brought at almost all by water in England. High-fashion felt hats were made out of the beaver. Furs. There were a symbol of wealth and social status. Extremely valuable and often passed from father to son.  The voyagers primarily French Canadian with a backbone of the fur trade. There are so the backbone of Thompson's Explorations Thomson could not have gone anywhere. Without the hired. Help. The voyagers, were laborers. The heavy lifters expected to work 16 hours a day, paddling 55, Strokes per minute. The birch bark canoe was the transportation of choice. There was a semi-trailer of the day. There's just no question about it. We're talking about a 25-foot boat.  Four feet across the beam. That was able to carry a ton and a half of trade, cargo the North American Fur. Trade was booming. The year. David Thompson was born, born in London in 1770. David Thomson was raised by his widowed mother in the tough part of Westminster at seven. He entered the gray coat, charity School, dedicated to educating poor children. If you  Smart you got on honors track. So he was taking trigonometry when he was 12 or 13 years old and getting good at it. Thompson learned the basics of practical navigation, the use of a quadrant and cross staff. And standard methods. For determining latitude. The Hudson's Bay Company knew about these charity schools as did the British Navy, and they were looking for people with surveying skills. In 1784 to students were apprenticed to the Hudson's Bay Company for seven years to work in the North American Fur.  Fair trade, one ran away. The other was 14 year old? David Thompson.  It must have been pretty shocking to land on the shores of Hudson Bay, which alone is a pretty rugged place. Let alone the kind of people that he's surrounded by being thrust into an alien landscape while still an adolescent learning, Cree learning Pig and learning French coming to know the lands of the people. And the people of Western North America at first hand.  Within months, the alien landscape froze. There were people that folded up under the pressure of being above the tree line, but he never complains about being cold. He goes out and learns, how to polar bears and Ptarmigan and fish and looks at mosquitoes. I mean, he's his boundless curiosity, that was developed. So well at the gray coat school is given a whole continent to flourish.  The fur trade was both a native and a European world. We make a mistake in thinking that we live in a multicultural age. As we look back at the world of the West, in the late, 18th and early 19th, centuries. We have the operational presence and there's so much diversity already. Just within that world. So you're hearing all  All the native languages, you hearing English Gaelic French. It's just such a fantastic tapestry, or mosaic of cultures at 17. Thompson was sent West to win to, with the black fate, at a wintering camp, near Calgary Alberta. That's where he met soccer mathy and Kootenai. Happy the Great War Chief and sohcahtoa the Civil Chief. So he formed a relationship with the pig. An he learned their language, their  Five white guys in a Winter Camp about 2,500 blacks fee, but the blackfeet are very hospitable to them, and they take this young teenager and put them in the tent of an elder, which is a very gracious thing to do so that you can learn something. During the winter. We were launched in the tenth of an old man. He was full six feet in height erect, and of a frame that showed strength and activity. I sat and listened to without being in the least tired. The older was a Kree named soccer map.  He night after night Thompson. Listen to soccer, Mappy tell stories. So I cannot be lived a life probably as interesting as Thompson's, he witnessed the introduction of the horse to the plains the introduction of firearms, two planes Warfare, we witness a smallpox epidemic and he was able to relate all of that to Thomson and Thompson. Intern through later to us. It's really easy to see his education to Western North America beginning in that tent.  David Thompson had The Misfortune to break his leg and it was so swelled that I found it a difficult matter to set, whatever the consequences may be as yet uncertain to. Hope for the best. William Thomason Hudson Bay Company 1789.  Thompson. Learned practical astronomy while recuperating from a broken leg when he was 19. He studied under Philip Turner, the best geographer in the new world at the time. But if you go through his journals, they're filled with astronomical observations and taken down in the most meticulous manner. It was a labor of love for him. He would get up in the middle of the night to look at the stars. And you really have to be committed to something to do that, and he would take readings again and again of a single place and then average them out.  To try to pinpoint that one spot on the surface of the globe. It's it almost something that it seems he was compelled to do. It's a very small world of people who have the skill and Thompson, who is coming from? Nowhere is in it and he can do it as good as anybody Denny de Maya is a land surveyor and a member of the surveyors Historical Society. The earliest definition of surveying was called practical astronomy. So we were all practical astronomers Once Upon a Time. Tamiya collects.

He continued to work for the Hudson's Bay Company, but the age of 27, Thompson abruptly left. Their employ. After 13 years of service. He walked to the nearest North West Company post and signed on with the competition. He felt he wasn't getting enough encouragement to go on and surveys that the Hudson's Bay Company had a mean and selfish policy. Whereas the North West Company were more liberal-minded Thompson did.  Give Hudson Bay a Year's notice and that was considered very bad form, William Thomason rotes. If he ever met David Thompson, he would be tempted to pull his ears off. So they were, there were certainly were people within the Hudson Bay Company were very angry when David Thompson left. Unlike the Hudson Bay Company that was controlled from afar. In London. The North West Company was based out of Montreal, the partners usually Scott's shared in the profits.  Thompson's, first assignment was an ambitious. One surveying trading posts from the Great Lakes to North Dakota in 10 months. He covered four thousand miles on that Journey. Thompson took the first accurate, longitude of an important Man, Dan Village trading center in North Dakota. He interviewed Elders Gathering important tribal knowledge about the upper, Missouri. He's combining tribal.  Mission and outdoor skills that he's learned in his apprenticeship with European style writing and mapmaking and it is quite an engaging mix. And he goes back and makes a map of what he calls. The bend of the Missouri, Thompson's Bend of the Missouri map ends up in the hands of Thomas.

It's not what we were designed to do, but I'll have to present that information and because we cannot allow the glucose in the bloodstream to rise excessively and because we only have 5 grams of glucose in the bloodstream, and we eat 100 grams at a sitting sudden, you've got this 100 grams of carbohydrates, which got to be stored in the blood system that can only take five. G and you have to ask the question. If glucose is so essential to humans. Why do we only have 5 grams in the bloodstream? So you've got this hundred grams coming to trying to stuff itself into a space that it only Take 5 grams and the response that the humans have evolved is to secrete the hormone insulin, and instant drives the glucose. As I'll show into the fat cells particularly, including the fat cells in the liver, and that then brings the glucose down, sir.  Hyperinsulinemia is a state where the insulin is higher than it should be in response to the glucose Challenge and one of the key differences in. So in people today the way we eat then we ate in the 1500s is in the 1500s. We ate once a day and that is documented across Europe. We ate once a day that meant, even if you had an insulin response, you had 23 hours for the system to get back to normal.  We do now is we eat every three hours and we told to eat every six. Told the eat six meals a day. That means if it's carbohydrates, we get this insulin response. So, every time we eat, we brought this in hyperinsulinemic response, and if you have insulin resistance, like people with diabetes, like myself, the response is exaggerated. Every time you eat, you're damaging your liver and your damaging your arteries.\",\n",

Much faster than that low blood sugar can cause fainting and unconscious.  This but so can hyperglycemia. But if you regularly feeling faint or pass out, talk to your doctor, instead of trying to self-diagnose. I've heard horror stories of people thinking, they have the plague and five other conditions, after searching Health, websites, to figure out what they have hypoglycemia can cause cold clammy skin, high blood sugar won't but stressing about it might low, blood sugar can be treated by having a snack or even sucking on candy.  D. If you feel bad and a candy makes you feel better. It is low blood sugar. Whereas if it makes the symptoms worse. You probably have high blood sugar. I've heard that your diet can impact things. If you do not have breakfast and pass out after walking to work, you have hypoglycemia, if you have bacon and eggs for breakfast and are fine, but orange juice, makes you sick. It is hyperglycemia. How else can I tell if I have hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia?  Your doctor should do a fasting blood test to see what your blood sugar levels are. If that's borderline. You could take the glucose tolerance test. I've heard of pregnant women going in fasting then drinking a sugary mix and their blood sugar testing every hour or two. If your body has trouble handling this sugar and releasing insulin in time to process. The drink. You'll have high blood sugar results on the test. I do not want to wait all day to do that, but that's only done assuming  You're not pregnant if the standard blood sugar tests, they do along with your cholesterol tests, make it seem necessary and the fasting blood sugar or FBS test is usually part of the free annual Wellness.

       " 'Ekqq6DE8vGE': \"Is type 2 diabetes a reversible disease, we're told that this is a chronic and Progressive disorder. That means that once you develop type 2 diabetes, you're going to have it for life and there's nothing you can do about it. You're going to be on medications you're going to be on insulin and then you're going to develop the complications blindness nerve damage.  Stations heart attacks Strokes, kidney damage dialysis the whole works. It's inevitable. But is it really imagine a world where type 2 diabetes is a simple reversible disorder where simple dietary maneuver can reverse your diabetes in a matter of weeks the American Diabetes Association, of course disagrees. They say right on their website that it's a fact that for most people  Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease.  So you might as well forget about it. Don't even try to get better. It's hopeless the telling you there's no hope.  But we can look at certain examples and we can see that this is actually not true at all.  Let me give you some of these examples bariatric surgery bariatric surgery is also called weight loss surgery or stomach stapling. What they do is they take your stomach in the cut it to the size of a walnut. So you really just can't eat because you're not eating you're going to lose a lot of weight. But what happens to the diabetes Well, let's look at this study here in this study. They randomized two groups of people one group of people stayed on their  Nations and got the best medical therapy available. The other group got weight loss surgery on the horizontal axis is time over 12 months on the vertical axis is a number of medications that these people were taking you can see that the number of medications that people took while doing the best medical therapy available really didn't change. They kept taking the same number of medications. They're really no better than they were when they started then they were at the end.  But look at the weight loss surgery group very quickly within a matter of months. They're coming off all their medications and it keeps going by 12 months many of these people are off of all their medications and their blood sugars are completely normal. That's amazing wasn't this a chronic and Progressive disorder wasn't this a disorder where there's no treatment and there's nothing you can do. It'll get worse. Well not  Really not according to this study. It looks like diabetes is a disease that's reversible. But better than that, it's quickly reversible and even other types of weight loss surgeries such as gastric banding have the same benefits gastric banding is a procedure where they put a belt inside your stomach and tighten it so that you can't eat and again what you see here is that the diabetes very quickly reverses and it stays gone. So this  is not a chronic and Progressive disorder. This is a reversible disorder. I'm not saying that back gastric banding or weight loss surgery is the answer for everybody but it's simply points to the fact that the situation is different and this is a reversible disease. Let's look at another example, we can look at fasting fasting is a dietary maneuver where you don't eat anything for a certain period of time I had this patient here Richard who came to  For treatment of his diabetes. He had been diabetic for 10 years. He was taking about 70 units of insulin and he was developing complications. He was getting eye disease. He was getting kidney disease. So he changed his diet. We put them on a low carbohydrate diet and we gave him some simple tips and we included some intermittent fasting in his regimen.  Over a period of months he lost about 50 pounds and his diabetes got incredibly better. We took him off all of his insulin took him off all of his medications and it's blood sugars are normal even two years out now, he's still on no medications and his blood sugars are doing amazing. So in fact, this is a reversible disease fasting seems to lead to a reversal of his  BTS and this is not a new finding. In fact, if we go back almost a hundred years. Dr. Elliot Jocelyn, perhaps the most famous diabetes specialist in history wrote this in the Canadian medical journal that temporary periods of undernutrition are helpful in the treatment of diabetes will probably be acknowledged by all after these two years of experience with fasting. So what  and was that he had been using fasting for two years and he thought it was so amazingly great that it's going to be obvious. Everybody's gonna know this there were a few problems. Of course at the time. He didn't differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes while it's very beneficial for type 2 diabetes. It really doesn't impact type one very much and with the discovery of insulin a few years later all Focus shifted to insulin and everybody forgot about these dietary Therapies.  Recently in the United Kingdom. Dr. Taylor performed a study called the Counterpoint study and there he put people on very low calorie diets while it's not fasting is very close and look at these results in this group. The blood sugar's went from nine point six two five point nine and seven days.  seven days  His sugars have gone back to normal what happened to this idea that it's chronic. It's regressive. You'll always be on medication.  It's simply not true. There's another example we can give we can look at the example of very low carbohydrate diets or so-called ketogenic diets. Let me give you a case. I had a 27 year old graduate student. She was actually studying physiology and she was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes her hemoglobin A1c was 10.4% This is a three-month average of her blood sugar's the diagnosis of diabetes.  Winds at six point five percent. So 10.4% is very high her doctors were very concerned. Of course started her on three medications right away being only 27. She said she didn't want to stay on medications for the rest of her life. So she looked on the internet and decided that she would follow it ketogenic diet. Well, she very quickly lost about 20 pounds and add her three-month checkup her hemoglobin A1c was 5.5% Well within the normal range  And clearly not diabetic better. She had taken herself off of all her medications as soon as she started. So in this case, it looked like her type 2 diabetes was essentially cured.  Wow.  That's not what we are told right, but we all know this is true. We all know that the type 2 diabetes is completely reversible.  For example, if somebody comes up to you and says, you know what I lost 50 pounds and my diabetes went away you'd say wow. That's great. Terrific good for you. You wouldn't say to them know you're lying to me the American Diabetes Association says, it's chronic and Progressive get back on your medications. No, of course not so it's immediately obvious that this is just a lie type 2 diabetes is not  Chronic, and it's not Progressive. It's reversible. But what about all the cases about people on medications? Do you ever hear people say hmm. I started my insulin or I started my medications and now I'm so much better. I took myself off.  No, not really. If you take medications your gently on it for life, right or what about the standard low-fat diet. Nobody ever comes up to me and says, you know, I went to my dietician. I started a low-fat diet and now I'm so much better. I'm off all my medications. I've seen thousands of patients and that doesn't happen.  So in those cases the diabetes is not cured.  So actually there are treatments that lead to a cure and there are treatments that do not lead to a cure. So those that lead to a cure bariatric surgery fasting and very low carb diets and these treatments do not lead to a cure insulin other drugs a low-fat diet. You'll never guess of course which direction all our current  Protocols and research are heading to they're all heading towards the path of no cure and that's why they tell you it's a chronic and Progressive disease, but it's not this is amazing news. This is amazing because type 2 diabetes in fact it curable and reversible disease the fact that treatments exist means that there is hope  For all of us drugs, however cannot cure the dietary disease The Cure must be a diet the right diet.\",\n",

So, let's crack on with the questions. Also, before we get into the questions. I just want to remind you or even let you know.

UK just saying that are there to support you and help you and answer your questions and  Just be someone who can truly understand what you're going through.

He may say, or do personally or to heart and get upset because he probably doesn't mean it and it's just his  motions, all kind of spiraling and going crazy. But other than that, honestly, I just find, you know, being with someone or being distracted helps. I do find distraction to be one of the best medicine. So, you know, just sit with him, watch a movie chat it. No talk about random stuff. Try and make him laugh, just being there, helps more than you ever know. Because the feeling that you  Yet when people suddenly disappear and leave you, because you're not feeling well and you have this Condition. It's such a horrible feeling. So just having you there and seeing that you're, you know, you're by your side is just it helps more than than, than you realize. Honestly question. Number two. What was it, like, having a feeding tube? It really isn't as bad as it may seem, I have had both an engine.  A tube and a Peg j-tube and that is a little judgmental tube and the page a goes through your stomach wall. And although I had quite a lot of problems with the pig j-tube that was more down to my ehlers-danlos and the healing of my skin rather than the tube. And the way the tube Works itself. If that makes sense to me, they are Lifesavers and they took pressure off of me to have to eat because I was getting the nutrients I needed. So I could just eat  Bits here and there for flavor and to feel normal. I guess or just use my drawer muscles. They don't tighten up but it took that pressure off so that I didn't feel. Oh I have to eat. Now. I'm going to get a lot of pain and I'm going to have a lot of suffering and it took away that kind of fear and hate of food in a way. And I mean Platt who can say they can sleep and eat all at the same time or that is totally acceptable to go to the toilet whilst  Eating. I mean you can't do that. I mean, I feel like this is a topic that could be like a whole video. So I don't know if you want me to do like a whole video on my experiences of tube feeding and kind of tips and tricks and stuff like that. If you do, be sure to let me know in the comments at play next up and do you have a safe option food? And I will be 100% honest with you and say no I used to but now I kind of  I can eat something one day and be relatively, okay, and then I'll have it the next day and be less than okay. I have things that I know will always cause me more pain, like pasta. I know to stay clear of unless I am willing to not be able to move for a long time and get very bloated. And I know red meats tend to cause more pain. So I know certain foods that tend to cause more pain. I don't have like a safe option.  Oh, to meld that isn't going to hurt. So yeah, badly gastroparesis is very unpredictable. So you may be okay one day, but you might not the next day, but then I also know people that do have safe option Foods. So, I mean, everyone's different. But for me, personally, I don't have one anymore, but I used to potato and Junior used to be a really good one. Has the gastric pacemaker helped. It has helped with my  Pain. And my nausea, I don't spend half my life over a toilet bowl anymore. It hasn't helped with pain. However, we were told going into it that it is primarily for sickness. Would I get it again? Knowing what I know now about it? Yes. I still do take anti sickness medication. It's not, you know.  Magic cure, it helps to a degree. I do wonder if it has sped up my, you know, emptying system because I haven't had an empty test in a while. So I do wonder if it has, you know, sped all things up down there. But, okay, this is kind of a two in one question. The question is, how do you deal with family and friends meals out and with deep being excluded from things?  I feel like this is maybe a topic for a separate video because this is something that everyone with gastroparesis will deal with. And it is not easy. Not even I'm not gonna sugarcoat. It is hot. And even now I sometimes, find a hard especially if I'm going through a bad phase. It isn't nice, being isolated and excluded from things. And when you do  Go to a restaurant or you get our student kind of feel very awkward, and I don't really ever go out to eat at restaurants. It is very, very, very rare that you will ever see me in a restaurant. Takeaways, will be like your best friend. So find someone who is willing to just chill at home in your jammies with a takeaway and help you deal with the consequences after basically, but like no honestly, it's it isn't easy.  And there is no easy way to deal with that because being isolated and excluded from things isn't easy because people will start to stop asking you or you know, you're saying no so many times that they just won't bother and it's hard. But in a way you also find out who your real friends are the ones willing to change things and adapt things, and do things, maybe a little bit differently there.  And that you want. Anyway, is how I try and look at it. What has it gastroparesis taught? You, is taught me a lot of things, but probably the main two would be to appreciate the things we do have in life. So especially like, the basic things that we just take for granted that help us survive like food, water.  A bed to sleep on. Make all of these things we take for granted and I did it before. I would just eat and eat and eat and didn't even think twice about it or think to be grateful for. I just did it. Like it was an everyday thing. No consequences wasn't grateful for or appreciate it. And yeah, I've just learned to really appreciate the things in life particularly.  Like the basic things that we have every single day, and the second thing would be it. Also taught me who my real friends are, and who the people are that. I really want in my life and who will stick by me, no matter what. And, yeah. I think those are probably like the main two things. Okay, I couldn't go on answering questions for literally ages. However, pretty sure you probably have things that you would like to do.  Or need to do that. Don't include watching me. So I hope this video helped answered even maybe one of your questions. If you do have any more questions about gastroparesis, be it from a softer or someone who is around a Safra, be sure to let me know in the comments below and maybe I'll do a part 2 of this video because I know for me watching videos of other people and their experiences with things helped me a lot more than just reading it on Medical website.  It's my stuff. If you did like this video or found it helpful. Be sure to give it a massive thumbs up. And if you have just been diagnosed with gastroparesis, or you know, someone who has been just remember, you are not alone. You are in this together and you now have a new family to hug.  Wait, yeah, and if you're not already, I would love you to hit that subscribe button. It would mean so much to me, and I would be very, very grateful and appreciative. If you did this. I will also leave the link to my last video in the description box below in case you want to go check that one out which and until next time, keep watching. Stay strong and stay safe. Bye guys, but to me, actually, it feels like even more of an\",\n",
       " 'NcLy6knx4': \"Hey guys, in this video. We're going to talk about low potassium. Why? Because potassium is probably the number one deficiency with most people, but it's the hardest to detect. Because when you take a blood test, most of the potassium 98% of your potassium, is inside the cell, not outside of self. So, when they do a blood test, it's not going to show up unless it's really, really, really extreme. So, the type of testing you would have to do would be an intra cellular.  Yes, it's very sophisticated. People don't really ask for it. Doctors probably don't even know about it. But there is a test that you can do but I like to go by symptoms. Here are the some of the symptoms of low potassium. By the way. This is not vitamin K. But this is a chemical symbol of potassium at the K. Plus. So when you're low potassium, the blood pressure will increase. Why? Because potassium is a physiological relaxer. It's a tranquilizer. Calm things down muscle cramps, because potassium.  Electrolyte sugar Cravings. Why? Because potassium helps you store Sugar and it will actually help you get rid of sugar Cravings because the storage of glucose needs potassium. Okay? Constipation. Yeah. So that's another symptom of low potassium and then High insulin, so there's a relationship between sugar blood sugar's diabetes and potassium. In fact,  You have enough potassium, the need for insulin goes down. So I always recommend potassium for diabetic clients number. This is another one muscle weakness. You could have this unexplainable muscle weakness, not know why, why? Because the the electrolytes are needed to help the muscles contract. And that's why you have an abnormal heartbeat because the heart is a muscle, same thing with this muscle, same thing with that muscle. So these abnormal Heartbeats,  For example, like, atrial fibrillation arrhythmias, that's a combination of deficiency of potassium and or magnesium. Okay. Anxiety and sleeping problems. Because potassium is something to calm you down. So, if you're doing something that doesn't involve a lot of, like some diet that doesn't involve enough potassium. You can start manifesting a lot of these symptoms. Now, let's just go into what causes low.  Potassium. Well, if you are sick and you vomit or let's say you're a bulimic that can cause that or maybe you're just not eating enough in your diet. Now you might say well I eat bananas, right? Well bananas only have 300 milligrams. You need forty seven hundred milligrams per day to hit your your regular amount that you need. So you would have to consume. I don't know.  Twelve bananas, loving bananas. So we don't want all that sugar. So what we want to do is we want to consume our potassium from vegetables from salad and you're going to need about 7 to 10 cups. Okay, if you watch my other videos, I talked about that. It's not that hard. You just have a couple big salads. If you don't like salad, take kale, maybe a little bit of berry, blend it with water and drink your salad. Okay, that'll get the potassium in there. So we want to start to increase that and that's how we increase it from.  The diet. You're going to feel a lot better too. Because if you're doing like a Atkins Diet, high protein, you're going to definitely need potassium. You're going to start feeling weakness because you don't have enough potassium. Okay. So ketosis is the state of fat burning when you're eating more fat no carbs, and you could become deficient potassium from that too. So that's why I always modify the ketosis diet. I make sure that we have enough greens and vegetables.  Both to help balance that and also potassium is necessary for the digestion in Breakdown, and build up of protein. So people that are losing their hair for example, and they're eating just protein thinking that they're going to get their hair back without potassium. Sorry doesn't work. So, we got diuretics. So, you're on a blood pressure medication. Well, you're going to deplete your potassium and keep the blood pressure there.  Are interesting, that's the diuretic. So that's one of the side effects. So you better make sure that your diuretic is not pulling out potassium, and you're not putting it back in. Okay, High cortisol that stress stress can also deplete potassium. In fact, I've had people do Advanced testing on their potassium levels and they are eating a tremendous amount of potassium, but because they're under a tremendous  - stress their potassium stays low. Because with the adrenal, it's almost like you have a hole in the bucket and the potassium goes right through. So again, when you're under stress, you need even more potassium. So anyway, this potassium is really important. I'm I forgot when it's also High insulin will cause a low potassium and that's sugar. So let's just add that to the list, consuming sugar will deplete your potassium.  And you can even feel it in your heart beat. Just go. It starts to go. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom, fast. You a strong heartbeat, you can hear it in your inner ear. That is a sign of low potassium because you just ate a lot of sugar and you need to start consuming more salad to put that back. So last one is drinking too much water. So this goes against what everyone says that you have to drink. When you're you know you by the time you drink it's too late because you're you don't know when you're thirsty and that's just a myth when you drink too much water.  You create a condition called hyponatremia, which is dilution of all your electrolytes and then your heart starts get going out of balance and you can have a heart attack by drinking too much water. So you want to drink when you're thirsty. So you don't flush out all your electrolytes because you're drinking water, but you're peeing out electrolytes. You're not putting in electrolytes. I like to hydrate my water with lemon. A little bit of apple cider vinegar, maybe a little Stevia if it's carbonated. I drink Pellegrino a lot or I  Drink filtered water. So I just want to kind of give you an overall on this very common deficiency that people have in the symptoms so you can start thinking with it. And if you start having any of these then you know, it could be connected with that and then you know, the cause of that. Okay, so I hope that helped I will see you in the next video.\",\n",
       " 'qPsqnbwoc': \"So now we finally get to talk about the half-life or the T 1/2, and this is an incredibly important topic. So I'm going to put some Stars next to it. So what is the elimination Half-Life? Well, the elimination Half-Life is the time. It takes to eliminate 50% of that drug from your body or from your plasma. And the reason we care about this is twofold one. We want to know how long it takes to get rid of all of that drug from our body and to by knowing how quickly we eliminate that drug.  Ugh, it gives us a sense of how frequently we should be dosing that drug. Now. What I want to do is kind of front-load this lecture and give you the three most important points to remember right off the bat and then we'll develop each of these points. So, the first point we've already talked about and that is the definition of Half-Life. This is the time. It takes to go from some initial concentration, C naught to 1/2 of that initial concentration. The second point.  I want you to remember, is that it doesn't matter, what your initial dosages or your initial concentration, 95% of that drug, will always be eliminated after four and a half half lives. So, if we're at any sort of seti, steady state, after four and a half half lives, 95% of that drug will be eliminated. Regardless of the initial concentration. The third point. I want you to remember is that the half-life is inversely proportional.  To the rate of drug metabolism. So if I metabolize the drug faster, we expect the half-life to go down. Now, we have a term which represents this rate of drug elimination. And this is ke or ke L. It's the first order elimination rate constant. First order, elimination rate.  Constant.  Now, you don't actually have to memorize this equation, but you need to understand what this term is here. So this term represents how quickly we are eliminating the drug. And if this increases we expect the half-life to decrease. Now, if you're unfamiliar with this term first order, elimination, I'd recommend going back to the last video and watching what that means in a nutshell. It says that with first order elimination, which is happening for most drugs at most dosages, the proportion of  Drug metabolize over time is constant. So while you don't have to memorize this equation, you need to memorize an equation. That is derived from this and that is the half-life is equal to, 0.693 times the volume of distribution divided by a term that we haven't heard before called the clearance. This guy is called the clearance.  And we'll talk about clearance in a future video. But real quick. The clearance is the volume of blood that gets eliminated of drug per unit time. So these are the three most important points to remember. And if you wanted to stop this video right here, and you just learn these three points, you would probably be okay, but that's not how we roll. We want to really understand things. So let's work through an example with a table here. So,  Example that we're going to use is we're going to say that the half-life of the drug is equal to 1 hour and that the initial concentration is equal to 8 mg of drug per liter of plasma. So we'll start off by looking at the left hand side of this table. Notice that the time increment is one hour. And this one hour is the half-life of the drug. So every hour that goes by, we expect the concentration of the drug to decrease by 1 half.  So let's look at the plasma concentration. If I started at eight milligrams per liter after one hour, I expect to be at 4 and after another hour, I expect to be at 2 and then at one and then at Point 5 and then at Point 2 5.  Now, moving on over to the right here. This part is a little more interesting. We have the amount of drug that is remaining and I listed it as fractions and also as a percentage. So after one half-life, we expect one half of the drug to be remaining after two half-lives. I have gone now down by 1/2 and buy another 1/2. So another way of writing this is I've gone down by 1/2 squared or I have 1/4 of the drug.  Meaning or 25%. Now, that means that I've metabolized 75% of the drug. If I go by, if I let another hour go by another Half-Life is gone by. So I've gone 1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2 or 1/2 to the third and I have 1/8 remaining. So notice this trend here, if you want to figure out, what fraction of the drug is remaining.  After a certain number of half-lives you just take so if three half-lives have gone by it's 1/2 raised to the 3rd or 1/8 of the drug is remaining. Now. Let's get to that second point that we talked about that 95% of the drug is always eliminated after around four and a half half lengths. So at 4 Half Lives, I have 6.25% remaining. That means I've metabolized around 94%  Of the drug. And so, as more time goes by, I'm going to metabolize another Half-Life, right? So, if I had 1/16 and I 1/32 left at five hours or five half lines, and that's around 97% of that drug has been eliminated. So somewhere between four and five Half Lives. We expect 95% of that drug to be eliminated and this does not depend on the initial concentration, if I would.  Have started at 32, then I would have been at 16 then at 8 then at four then at 2 then at 1 and somewhere between here. I would have also eliminated 95% of the drug. So that is point 2 and the third Point has to do with the first order, elimination rate constant and how it relates to the half-life and to do that. We need to graph a first order elimination rate graph using a  Your plot and then using a semi-log plot. So using a linear plot. Remember that the first that the half-life is one hour, and so if I started at eight milligrams per liter after an hour, I'd be around for and then I'd be around to and then I'd be around 1 and then I'd be around 0.5. And if I wanted to graph this, I get this exponential graph now, as scientists, right? We want to be able to describe this.  Graph, and if I wanted to know, the plasma concentration at any point, it can be given by this equation. And that is that the concentration at any time. T is equal to your initial concentration times e raised to the negative K T, where K is that first order, elimination rate constant. Now you don't have to memorize this equation, but from this equation, I can solve  Of this for the half-life. And if I do that, that's where I get the T 1/2 is equal to 0.693 over that first order, elimination rate constant. Now, maybe what I'll do in a future video is just talk about how this is derived. But that's beyond the scope of what we're talking about. Now. The bigger point is to understand this inverse relationship between the half-life and the elimination rate constant. Now, the best way to do that is by looking at a semi-log.  Ugh graph. And so, what is a semi-log graph? It's probably been a while since people have used this. So when I say semi log, half of the graph is a logarithmic graph or half of the scale and that's the y axis is logarithmic, where the other half is linear. And so notice the units here. I start at point two, five, and then I double point five and then I doubled 1. And then a 2 4, 8, or another way of thinking of this is that the concentration is decreasing.  One half each time. So this is the perfect graph to graph the half-life. So if I started at 8:00 after a certain period of time one, half-life, I would be at four and then a two and then at 1 and then add point five. And if I went to another one, I would be 0.25. Now there is no way. This graph is going to be exponential. It is a linear graph, and that is because I'm using a logarithmic scale.  Now, this graph helps us helps us in a couple of ways. First off. I want you to note that this slope.  Correlates very well, which is right. Correlates with that first order, elimination rate constant and maybe in that future video where I talk about how half life is derived. I'll tell you how you can solve for K, but just know that it correlates with it and for your purposes, you can just say the slope is K.  And so the point here is that the steeper, the slope, the steeper, the slope, the steeper, the slope.  This increases the first order elimination rate constant K. And as a result, I'm eliminating faster and I decrease the half-life remember, there is an inverse relationship between the two. So what I'll do here is I'm just going to graph a new plot. So this new plot, I'm still starting at 8:00. But after three hours, I've gotten rid of most of that drug. So, using this graph if I wanted to  All for the half-life, I just take two points that I have half the concentration of one another. So, let's just say here at, you know, at to Millet, when I'm at this value of 2, for the plasma concentration, two milligrams per liter. I was at 1 hour and half of that would be when I'm at one. And that looks like I'm at about 1 & a half hours 1.5., So the time it takes to go from an initial.  Asian to 1/2, your initial concentration is the half-life. So the T 1/2 here is equal to 0.5 hours. So as this graph is becoming steeper as I'm increasing the rate of elimination. The half-life is going down. It went from 12.5. And so the point is that you need to remember this inverse relationship between the rate of metabolism and the drug half-life.  Now you should walk away from this with these three main points that we've listed up here. Maybe what I'll do in the next video is just quickly cover some of the math here for all of us nerds who like this very much. But the next big topic we're going to talk about is drug clearance and really will get into excretion. So make sure to subscribe to my channel to see whenever new videos become available.

       " 'ETvIajBXFCw': \"Is starting now.  In today's lesson, we're going to look at the primary ways in which energy status insulin and glucagon regulate gluconeogenesis. Now, it's important to realize that gluconeogenesis is also regulated by the stress response. And that's something we'll talk about in the next lesson, but in today's lesson, we're just going to focus on when you're in higher energy status versus low energy status. When you have a lot of glucose and don't need gluconeogenesis versus you don't  How does that play out on the minute-to-minute? An hour-to-hour basis in regulating, this extremely expensive process, that you can't afford to engage in unnecessarily.  The slide on the screen shows. Why the livers metabolism of glucose, is more complicated than the metabolism of glucose and other tissues such as skeletal muscle. The liver is the metabolic Hub of the body and it's responsible for interconverting. A lot of things to help the rest of the body, meet its needs for energy metabolism. So you can imagine for example, that glucose as  Centerpiece of our discussion could be coming in from blood glucose, but the liver is also the most important organ in releasing glucose into the blood for its use by other tissues. So that glucose can come from the liver and go into the blood. Most other tissues are going to trap the glucose that they need and not take up any more. It's totally different for the liver. So the liver will always be taking in  in the excess of glucose that it can handle. And one of the things you can do with it, is stored as glycogen. But again, the livers going to release glycogen to make free glucose primarily for the purpose of releasing it back into the blood for use by other tissues glucose in the liver can also become pyruvate, and that pyruvate can enter the citric acid cycle.  But the liver is responsible for synthesizing more than its own share of biochemicals within the body. So the liver especially out of all the organs is going to be very involved in biosynthesis. So quite often citrate is leaving the citric acid cycle for the purposes of biosynthesis. Remember that citrate is moving from the mitochondria into the cytosol to become the source of cytosolic acetyl-coa and cytosol a casita.  Les is what is used for anabolic synthesis. Now, it's not used for the synthesis of everything. We talked about fatty acids, but it's also used for other things. For example, cytosol, Castillo a is also the building block for cholesterol, for example, for now, we'll just say that pyruvate from glucose is often coming into the citric acid cycle in the liver. In order to provide citrate that moves into the cytosol to become cytosolic acetyl, Co a for the purposes of biosynthesis.  Of course that pyruvate can enter the citric acid cycle for the purposes of energy production as well. However, the liver also handles more than its fair share of the amino acid metabolism. And that's because the liver is the primary organ responsible for disposing of excess nitrogen. So that means that amino acids that can come to the liver.  And need to be metabolized to get rid of the excess. Nitrogen could generate pyruvate just like glucose could for the purpose of generating that citrate or for the purposes of energy production or other amino acids that don't generate pyruvate still. Their nitrogen needs to be disposed of and so what's left over, after you get rid of that nitrogen, can enter the citric acid cycle, and be used for energy production.  So, the liver is also going to use amino acids for energy at a much greater rate than most other tissues would. And since the liver can largely meet its energy demands through amino acids. Then that means that glucose is going to by and large be left over as the principal source of biosynthesis in the liver and its primary role will often be.  Lead to make citrate instead of to be burned for energy because the livers handling amino acids and getting rid of their nitrogen and burning what's left over for its energy.  Now, all this can change depending on your diet, of course. So for example, if you have less glucose in your diet and you have more protein in your diet, then that's going to accelerate this differential even further where the liver is going to be, especially using amino acids for energy because it's not going to be the one to use glucose for energy when glucose is scarce because it has to provide that glucose to the rest of the body. And if protein is abundant  All the more will it be the one to use those amino acids for energy? Since it is the one that can dispose of their excess nitrogen?  Now, the livers need to coordinate all these rules implies that the livers regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis has to be a little bit more complicated than what we'd find. In other tissues that aren't acting as the metabolic Hub of the organism. And are instead primarily engaging these processes for their own needs.  So glycolysis in the liver is largely regulated. Like it is in skeletal muscle, which we looked at previously in lesson 21, but there are also additional regulatory mechanisms that are layered on top of this.  One of those Regulators is citrate, citrate signals that you have sufficient biosynthetic precursors and it is specially signifies glucose because on a mixed diet, especially glucose is going to be the primary source of that citrate and glucose also supplies. Nadph through the pentose phosphate pathway that is also needed in addition to citrate for biosynthesis alanine will be another key regulator since Al  Need can be a source of pyruvate. Then alanine could either signal that you have more pyruvate than you need. Because what you do have is spilling over into alanine or it could be a signal that you don't need to derive pyruvate from glucose as much or you don't need to throw that pyruvate into the citric acid cycle as much because you have an abundant at least of alanine, and probably in that case of other amino acids that can provide energy into the city.  I casted cycle.  Another key regulator in the liver is fructose to 6 bisphosphate and this is a signal will talk about how its formed in more detail soon. But this is a signal that there is an abundance of glucose in the liver and in the body. So gluconeogenesis is unnecessary, and this is going to respond both to the flux of glucose in and out and also to insulin and glucagon as we'll see shortly.  The first aspect of what makes glycolysis uniquely regulated in the liver is what allows entry of more glucose into the liver than the liver needs for itself. And these are points that we've already discussed in the context of how glucose is transported throughout the body, the liver, like the pancreas expresses glute too, which is a glucose transporter, that's only active at very high.  Concentrations. This is not to say that the liver doesn't also rely on glute 1 and glute 3, which are always active at normal fasting levels, but glue one include three are expressed by every tissue in the body. And there would allow any organ to take up the glucose that it needs any time.  Glue two is expressed primarily in the liver and the pancreas on top of the other glutes in order to allow excess skimming off the top. When the glucose Supply rises above normal fasting levels.  In addition to that, the liver has hexokinase for or glucokinase. Like the pancreas in addition to the other hexokinase that are operative in most tissues. And this acts similarly, is glue to. So as the excess glucose spills into the liver coming being skimmed off the top of a increased load, then not only does glue to become active to allow it to come into the cell, but also hexokinase for  Glucokinase is going to convert the glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, no matter how much glucose 6-phosphate you have. What's special about hexokinase for or glucokinase, is that it is not inhibited by glucose-6-phosphate.  Any other tissue will take in glucose as long as it needs it. But if the glucose 6-phosphate accumulates, it shuts down hexokinase, which causes the rise in glucose and causes glucose to not come into the cell, and maybe even go out of the cell. That is not the case here in the liver as much glucose as comes in. Also gets activated to glucose-6-phosphate, no matter how much glucose 6-phosphate you have.  Now, glucose-6-phosphate could be available for the pentose phosphate pathway, or for glycogen storage. And remember the the liver is engaging in glycogen storage primarily for the purposes of releasing blood glucose leader. When it's not abundant into the blood, for other tissues to use. And whether the glucose goes down into glycolysis is primarily regulated by phosphofructokinase or pfk which regulates the conversion of fur.  So 6-phosphate to fructose 1, 6 bisphosphate. The first committed irreversible step of glycolysis and that's regulated by the need for glycolysis. Previously, we talked about how this is regulated in skeletal muscle and pfk and skeletal muscle is regulated, primarily by energy status, because the skeletal muscles need for glycolysis is pretty much all about.\",\n",
       " 'SCEBGxXk': \"Time course of the blood glucose before the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. There's actually two phases. So there's a long slow phase where the blood glucose Rises, very, very slowly and that's where the insulin resistance is rising. Okay, but the body produces enough insulin to overcome this resistance, so the blood glucose stays relatively normal, it's compensated, right? So it's called a compensatory hyperinsulinemia. At some point. The pancreas doesn't produce sufficient insulin either. Insulin resistance is too high or the, the amount of insulin drops. So because you lose this compensation, the blood glucose goes up in type, 2, diabetes is diagnosed but that's relatively late in the game. The slide shows you that even up to 14 years, prior to the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, you get this Rising insulin resistance. So you can see this, when you look across the spectrum of lean people and obese people then as they develop more and more pre-diabetes and diabetes, insulin resistance goes up and up.  And this is a slide of the beta cells. So the beta cells in the pancreas produces insulin. And this is the black circles. You can see, as you go across the Spectrum from normal to obese to pre-diabetes 2. Diabetes, insulin production initially goes up. So, as you go to the middle, the black circles, you can see that it goes up. But at some point it drops and the white circles is the blood glucose, and you see as the insulin production drops, the blood glucose goes up and you make the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, but the key problem, there's two key problems, right answer.  Resistance in the beta cell dysfunction. And for this reason, people tell you that the beta cells are burning out, right? And that's why type 2, diabetes is chronic and Progressive and eventually, you know, you take medication, then you take insulin they take more insulin and morons and more insulin. And that's the way we tell people to think about type 2 diabetes. Unfortunately, is not really true. So the key is to understand what instant resistance actually is, okay. Why are where does it come from? How?  How does it develop? So in order to understand insulin resistance, you got to think about what insulin normally does. So when you eat food, insulin goes up, right insulin? Basically tells the body that food is coming in and you should store some of it. So you store sugar in the liver, which is glycogen and you store fat also. So, if you produce if you eat too much carbohydrates, then that is going to be produced by a process called de novo lipogenesis and to fat. And when you don't eat, which is simply called fasting, right?  Just the flip side of eating when you don't eat instant Falls and as it falls, it tells your body to pull some of that sugar and pull some of that fat back out of the system. So as long as you balance your feeding and fasting, you got a well balanced system. You don't actually gain any weight, right? Because you eat, you store Sugar. You don't eat you fast. You burn. Sugar, right? That's that's basically all it is. So insulin does a couple of things. So let's all the glucose into the cell, but it's also produces a this new  you fat, right? That's the de novo lipogenesis. So there's two functions, not simply one in. This is the way we think about type 2, about insulin resistance hits, this lock and key Paradigm that insulin acts like a key on the cell. So this is, for example, a liver cell. So you have receptors which is like a lock when insulin is produced. It opens the gate and it lets all the glucose in. So what we tell people, is that insulin resistance is actually a state where this mechanism does lock and key pair.  I'm is completely gummed up. Okay, so it's not that the lock is defective or the key is defective, because you can easily sequence the insulin or the insulin receptor there normal, but something is gumming up the system. So all the glucose stays outside and the cell faces, this state of quote-unquote, internal starvation, right? Because it can't go in.  What that means of course is that the liver cell cannot produce fat, right? You got no glucose in there. You're not going to produce fat. So what internal starvation looks like is this because we know in type 1 diabetes, untreated type 1 diabetes, that the Salve faces internal starvation and you look like the the patient on the left. So she's starving away. You can feed her whatever you want. You can't use it. And she basically waste away until she dies. If you give her insulin her cells now.  Don't have the internal servation and she regains the way it's so great. We know that's what happens when the glucose can't go in. But this is what type 2 diabetes looks like, right? This is what we're calling. Internal starvation.  There's something a little bit wrong with that Paradigm of a gummed up locking key system because there's a paradox here, that is not explained by this gummed up lock and key. Because if you look at this liver cell, okay, so insulin, it pushes the glucose into the cell and if your insulin resistance, it doesn't do that. So, okay, that's great. But the other thing, this liver cell is supposed to do is turn on production of new fat. So if your insulin resistant, you can't produce  You Fatso like that, untreated type 1, diabetes, you waste away, but that's not the case in type 2 diabetes.  If the glucose is not going into the cell, how is this cell producing tons and tons and tons of fat because we know that the type 2 diabetes insulin resistant. Patient has a lot of insulin resistance has a lot of fatty liver. In fact, you always see the fatty liver, right? So, how can this cell the very same cell? The very same insulin, the very same insulin receptor?  These resistant, on the one hand, to one of the functions and super sensitive to the other function. It's not correct.  And we've based our entire treatment of type 2 diabetes on an incorrect Paradigm. So, what happens in this liver cell, of course, is that you have insulin as you have insulin, it puts to the sugar and the fat into the liver. So I've depicted the liver as a balloon, right? So it blows up when you eat as insulin Falls. It comes back out, right? That's all it is. It's a storage problem, but the problem with fatty liver.  Is that if it fills up with persistent insulins, if you eat a lot of glucose, if you lot of fuck, those are going to fill up this liver cell, right? Because insulin, you're acting all the time. You're going to keep pushing it into storage. What happens is that you get fatty liver, right? That's not so hard to understand, but it's this fatty liver. That's the key to understanding insulin resistance, because if you have a huge fatty liver that same dose of insulin is not going to be able to shove anymore fat.  Into this fatty liver. And if you don't have insulin, then it all of this fat and sugar just comes rushing back out. Right? So the reason that you have the central Paradox is because this is an overflow Paradigm, right? The, the glucose can't go into the cell, but the fact keeps coming out. If the glucose can go in, you couldn't make the fat but it's not a under-filled cell. It's an overflowing cell, right? In this fatty liver precedes, the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.  Be teased because it's on that long slow rise where you get the slow rise in the blood glucose slow rise in the insulin resistance. So this is the Whitehall study which shows you the time course of the liver enzymes before the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. And what you can see is that they broke the group into two groups, one that eventually develop diabetes, and one that eventually didn't and what was the big difference? Well, if you look at the markers of liver test, you can see that the liver is slowly getting distended.  And slowly getting inflamed. Those alt which is a marker of liver damage is slowly going up. And what they called it is, the long Silent Scream from the liver. You can't hear it. You can only see it on the blood test. You might be able to see it on CT or MRI, but it's this big fatty liver. That's the key to understanding the insulin resistance. So it's really an overflow Paradigm. Right? So, the cell is like this luggage, right? As you fill it up. It's harder and harder to put in more stuff.  So at first you can put in your clothes fine, but that those last two T-shirts. You just can't shove them in, right? So you use more Force, you use more insulin to keep shoving stuff in.  But that's not the problem. The problem is not the insulin. The problem is that your cell is overfilled. It's an overflow Paradigm, just like this, your cell is like a train, right? And it's got passengers and normally they go, in insulin opens the door stuff goes in, but what happens if that cell is already filled, right? If it's already filled with glucose and fat that liver cell, you keep shoving it in with insulin. That's not the solution, right? Because you have the wrong Paradigm, you  That the train is not opening the door. So you hire these, these guys to keep shoving people in, they do this in Japan because because it's cool, but the problem is the glucose stays outside, right? The passengers can't get in. So you keep trying to shove it in, which is fine. At first. Then you go to the next stop. You hire more guys, right? Hire more insulin, guys, keep shoving it in, right? And it happens to have worked for the next stop. Then you hire more guys to keep shoving it in until you can't anymore.  Then everybody stays outside, you make the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. So the key to understanding type 2 diabetes, is it's all about the fatty liver as marketers talked about right? The cell. The liver cell is just packed with fat so you can't shove anymore in. That's the whole point. And the meantime the liver is busy trying to decompress itself of all this fat, right? So what it does it, so it's making all this new fad through de novo lipogenesis and it packages that through triglycerides in the block.  Right? And it's pouring out this triglycerides and that's why de novo lipogenesis is so high. It's not resistant. Remember this is the effect of insulin. It's super sensitive. It keeps trying to push it all out. So how do you get fatty liver? Well, it's not so hard and geese, right. This is how you make foie gras. Right? So you take a booze, you shove a tube down his neck and what do you feed it? Where you feed it starch, right? Because you want the liver to make new fad.  Don't make new fat by eating fat humans. Don't do that. The dietary fat does not go to the liver. It goes directly into the bloodstream through chylomicrons into the thoracic duct into the lymphatic system. But what happens is when you feed it, starches and fructose, particularly you get fatty liver, and that's what happens in humans as well. When you overfeed carbohydrates, glucose and fructose, you get fatty liver and that's how you get insulin resistance. So the key again to understanding this,  this is that it's\",\n",

       " 'f0D1DePVVdo': \"Leg ulcers are common approximately 2% of adults, will have a leg ulcer at some stage in their lives. Literally thousands of people develop a leg ulcer each year in the United Kingdom, and many of those get more leg ulcers as the years go. By despite the misery. They cause leg ulcers remain. A neglected problem. I'm going to tell you  the 7 essential facts, you should know about leg ulcers.  Number one. What is an ulcer? The medical definition of an ulcer is a break in the epithelium of a body surface or lining. Many of us will be familiar with a mouth ulcer. This is a break in the cell lining of the mouth. It can be caused by an injury such as biting the inside of the mouth by accident.  Well, if the skin breaks down anywhere on the body, it is called an ulcer. If the Elsa is on the leg and has been present for more than six weeks. It is called a chronic leg ulcer.  Number two, what causes a leg ulcer four out of five ulcers? That's 80 percent are caused by a problem with the leg vein pump and they are called venous ulcers. The leg vein pump is the mechanism by which blood flows out of the leg back to the heart. So problems with the Deep veins, such as obstruction from deep vein, thrombosis.  Superficial vein reflux or perforator vein problems can cause venous leg ulcers the leg vein pump depends, mainly on good ankle movement. Good calf muscles and healthy leg veins. A minority of leg ulcers. About 15 percent are caused by problems in the arteries that carry blood into the leg about 95% of venous leg ulcers.  Sis can be correctly, identified by their appearance by checking for pulses in the feet, and by checking sensation as most leg ulcers of Venus. That's what I'm going to concentrate on.  Number three. Where on the leg? Do you get venous ulcers? Well, venous leg ulcers appear on the lower part of the leg. Usually just above the ankle often. There are varicose veins or thread veins around the ulcer, and the leg is usually swollen. The skin is often thickened, discolored by varicose eczema, which may actually develop many months or years before.  Elsa as a warning sign that the vein circulation is not normal, number four who gets a venous ulcer. Well, these ulcers affect people who have deep, vein prom problems. Usually from a past deep vein, thrombosis people who have superficial venous disease or those with ankle Mobility problems. Leg ulcers are more common as we get older.  Number five. How do you treat venous ulcers? The aim of treatment is to get the ulcer healed as quickly as possible. This usually means graduated compression, either with bandages or compression stockings in most cases, antibiotics creams and ointments are not necessary.  Once the ulcer is healed. It is very important to identify any problems with the superficial veins or the perforator veins. And these are treated to reduce the risk of another ulcer.  This means getting a full assessment with a duplex. Ultrasound scan.  Number 6. Can you cure a leg ulcer? Well, this is controversial. Some would say that. If the problem is only in The Superficial veins, the veins under the skin, or in the perforator veins. That connect these superficial veins to the Deep veins, then, the ulcer can be cured. While there is good evidence that such treatment will greatly reduce the risks of getting another lie.  Also, if the skin has been very damaged and the Elsa has healed with a lot of scarring, this area of the leg May remain vulnerable and a trivial knock or an injury might cause another skin breakdown, even though the vein abnormality has been completely eradicated.  Number 7. How can we avoid leg ulcers? Well, there are three things. I would suggest. Firstly, if you are unfortunate enough to suffer a deep vein thrombosis. It should be treated promptly to limit the damage to the Deep veins. Unfortunately, damage to the Deep veins. Cannot be reliably reversed by surgery. So prompt treatment with anticoagulants.  Thinning medication reduces the extent of the clot and the damage to the Deep veins.  Secondly, if you have had a DVT, you should consider wearing good quality, medical grade compression socks.  Some studies suggest that doing. So may reduce the risks of leg ulcers after a big DVT.  Thirdly, if you have superficial vein reflux, have it treated early to reduce the chances of progression to varicose eczema, which is itself. A warning sign that the skin is damaged and liable to ulceration.  Now, I hope you found this useful. Don't forget to subscribe to keep up to date with the latest on veins.

       " 'f2HnkDGuBqk': \"Welcome to highfalutin low-carb the weekly web series where we find and tests the best low carb recipe.  Hi guys will come morning. I've got I look amazing. It's early on a Monday morning. Don't get worried. Nothing's gone wrong with the other show. It'll be back. I just wanted to try something a little bit different. I've wondered how very sleepy I've often wondered how sweeteners artificial sweeteners real sweeteners affect my blood sugar. So I've devised a little plan where in every morning. I'm going to get up and have  Upload cups of coffee just like I normally do and each morning. I'm going to put in a different sugar or sugar substitute and then I'm going to use my handy, dandy.  Yeah, that thing to test my blood sugar and see how this goes so I can definitively know if erythritol does or does not Spike my blood sugar or monk fruit or equal or Sweet and Low whatever they may be it's a little unnerving knowing that I'm going to start out my days for the next few days at least with something that could possibly Spike my blood sugar, but this is in the name of science. So I'm kind of quietly speaking because the house is still asleep. It's very early here.  She can tell so anyway, I'm going to test my blood sugar this morning before I have any coffee. And then today I'm not using any sweetener just do it. Like I normally do with heavy whipping cream just a tablespoon of that. So we'll we'll test that to get a baseline of what my blood sugar does in the morning and we'll go from there. All right guys.  It's amazing. How terrible I look in a ring light at 5:45 in the morning.  All right. I'll meet you back here every morning. It's a date. Like I said.  Hey guys, we're back this morning blood sugar Rose a little bit yesterday from like 80 to 100 within the hour of getting up didn't have any sugar in my coffee did have two tablespoons of whipping cream. So we're going to do some black coffee one day this week as well just to test that today is going to be erythritol. So let me get a quick blood pressure. I mean blood pressure blood sugar reading for this morning.  Because I need some coffee. Yeah sleepy.  Feels odd letting people see your bed head and morning sleepy time face. All of these things are so fiddly and sharp. That's a lot to deal with in the morning be honest with you. If you're diabetic. This isn't fun. I guess I'm not diabetic. I just happen to have one of these that I wanted to test sugar with just for dietary reasons.  Tao hate that thing. All right. Let's see what it is 96 this morning. Anyway, I'm gonna go drink some coffee. Bye guys.  Okay, good morning. We're back again. Very sleepy this morning. I ran out of test strips yesterday. So I had to I had to take a Hiatus for one day, but we're going to resume today and damn these things are expensive like 25 bucks 29 bucks for 25 of these that's cuckoo because I don't really need them for medical reasons. Obviously my insurance doesn't cover them. So let's do this again today. What are we going to have today?  Today is going to be splendor.  which I'm scared of and I don't really like but  all in the name of science goes all in the name of science Lord. Are you kidding me? Jesus Christ? Okay. Okay. Let's do this one. You ready? This is gonna hurt a little white leaves how 102 alright time for coffee.  Good morning, guys. It's the weekend. I'm trying to be quiet. We've actually got some family in the house today. We had a family reunions. I did pretty well. I was actually kind of scared about that because as you can imagine a family reunions in the South involves tons of food, but I did well anyway today, I think I'm going to test the monk fruit the new Naturals brand monk fruit of very dear friend of mine from college Elin. We were chatting on Facebook and she told me the wonderful things about  Monk fruit and I told her I was skeptical of it because I'd heard so much about the the In The Raw brand which obviously is mixed with dextrose and maltodextrine and I said I was scared it was going to spike me and she told me of the new Naturals Brands which is supposedly only monk fruit. And in fact, it comes in like a salt shaker situation where you shake it on your food because you have to use so little of it. I think it says something like 160 fourth of a teaspoon.  Is equivalent to two teaspoons of sugar so this stuff is crazy strong. So I'm going to try that today and see how it goes. I'm filming I'll be just woman. I guess I need to go.  Hey guys. Guess what? It's Monday morning again boo had a wonderful weekend. I've had family in town for a big family reunions. Anyway, I think today I'm going to do one of the sweeteners that I avoided last week and I don't really want to do and that's odd to say but it's sugar.  I'm just curious what it does but it's frustrating to know that you know, everybody wants to start a diet on a Monday morning and here I will be basically sabotaging that in some way all in the name of this whatever this project is that I'm I'm trying to find out all I mean let the dog out.  And I'm come on it's you I'm trying to keep it about a 2 teaspoon equivalent for all of these sweeteners per cup of coffee and I'm having two cups of coffee Mike 7:30, but I'm only putting three. Yeah talk about gluttony. I actually have three but I'm only putting a sweeteners in the first two which I down pretty quickly to try to get the sugar into me and caffeine. So anyway, I'm rambling this morning. Let's take our sugar here and see what it is this.  Monday morning, here we go.  Go surprise you every time. Okay. I've just sat down out here and with my first cup of coffee of the morning and I really wanted to make a big deal of it and say oh yeah sugar tastes terrible. I'm so good. Now. I don't even like sugar. That would be a big lie to you and me, it tastes like magic. So I want to sit out here and enjoy it and I hope to God it doesn't screw me up for the rest of the day and cause me to Crave everything under the sun. I don't need that.  Monday we got to talk. I usually don't do a video update after I drink my coffee. I just take a photo of my blood sugar.  I don't know if you can see that if it'll focus on that because it's focusing on me 145 our out now little less than an hour and my sugar has gone from a hundred to a hundred forty-five so wowzers. I'm not looking forward to the rest of the day because of that either. Anyway, I just wanted to let you know. That sucks. Bye.  Good morning. Here. We are again is wicked early this morning. I've been putting off testing the pink and the blue stuff the Sweet and Low and the equal because I hate to them. So no matter what it says with my blood sugar. I will never use them just because they're tastier one make me feel terrible. So but I want to do it in the name of science here. So  Let's see what we've got.  Oops, I'll damn my machine is in the kitchen charging. I'll be back. Hold on.  Okay. Now we got to stick myself again. These things are fiddly. Okay, still bleeding you smash on it? And that's a dirty. One old one. Jesus is too early to be Dubrow literally pinched my finger in the jar. God Gumby coagulated by the time he gets here. Come on fire up.  It's a little high 102 mean I guess that's how I don't really know. I mean some days it's been 80 in the morning and some days. It's been a hundred. So all right, I'm gonna go drink some coffee. I think I'll do the blue stuff today the equal so beach in the morning, okay.  A hundred again almost right on.  So today we're going to try a product that I really liked and I have some suspicions that it probably does Spike my blood sugar. I'm not sure likes my shirts coming off fiber syrup. Let's try to get it in the light. Can you see that fiber syrup gold this stuff is from Denmark and it claims to have per two tablespoons 30.  total carbohydrates  28 of which are fiber and two of which are sugars. We're going to see if that's true. This stuff is delicious. That's the hope. It doesn't Spike me because I love this stuff as you see the bottle is almost all gone. It tastes like pancake syrup and I ain't joking is good. So say a little prayer for me that this doesn't Spike my blood sugar because it Dino it it's so good. So, I don't know how it's going to go in coffee. I probably wouldn't put pancake syrup in my  Coffee but just for the purposes of this making everything equal in this test working out. I'm going to use it as coffee sweetener for today following the same exact rules using the same average quantities of two teaspoons per cup. All right, so I'm going to record this. I'm going to make some coffee and let's do this again. Oh my God. I cannot use Fiber syrup ever ever again. This magic stuff that I was talking about how fantastic it was.  There's a reason that it's so fantastic.  A hundred and eighty nine one serving size is 2 tablespoons of this. I used four teaspoons 2 teaspoons in each cup of coffee that I had in the first two cups of coffee and my usual creamer. I usually have a blood sugar rise of 10 or 15 points and that's probably from the the creamer. We're going to test that later in the week. I'm going to have the coffee without the cream probably tomorrow.  Y'all 90 point eighty nine points my blood sugar's shot up. That was more than the sugar. I used pure sugar 4 teaspoons of pure sugar and my blood sugar only went up to a hundred forty-seven. It is at a hundred and eighty-nine gosh.  Sukra in fiber syrup gold can't do it. Any more sugar booger gonna have to throw you in the garbage damn stuff. It's good. Yeah, it's pure sugar. Good morning guys. I do believe this is the last day of this little project. We've been doing here together. It's almost been to two weeks. I think I forgot. I don't know exactly how many 1 2  3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 so it's been 11 days about 12 days. There were a couple of days missed in there. So we've hit and touched on most all of the major sweeteners. I believe I got them all. So today is the last day. I'm going to do coffee with no cream today just black coffee the same brand of coffee. I've been using all week and we'll go from there just to see how much the creamer actually has been affecting my sugar and then I'm going to compile all of this today or tomorrow. I just  To reiterate and I'm probably going to say this in a better way, but later when awake I'm not a doctor, I'm not diabetic. I have not been trained in how to do any of this. This is just a project for me a project for me to tell myself how these things have affected me and I had one little shock there as you know with that super and fiber gold. What a disappointment and had I not done this how many days weeks months years would I have gone poor and that stuff on and just but one? Yeah, this is  Low carb Mmm Yeah, it's not affecting me a bit and Meanwhile, my blood sugar is through the roof. So channel will be back to normal next week.

I'm testing my fasting blood sugar. Love you guys appreciate all the support channels growing so quickly. I just never imagined. I hope here shortly. I can do a 1000 subscriber update. I thought that that would be coming at the end of the year. Not at the  Of a month or two, so that's because of you. Appreciate it. Love you guys. See you next time.  Now if you like this video hit the like button below or better yet like this video And subscribe to our Channel these videos are a way for me to maintain my focus on a low-carb eating plan. I've personally experienced the weight loss and better help that a low carb lifestyle can produce. So I appreciate you guys coming along for the journey we make videos every week.

Let's talk about the mechanism underlying the cause of diabetic nephropathy.  Why and how individuals with diabetes develop the condition so diabetic nephropathy is a chronic complication of diabetes mellitus meaning it usually has a slow progression over decades after the initial diagnosis of diabetes and to give you an overview of what happens an insulin deficiency due to the diabetes results in hyperglycemia, which then causes hypertension and kidney dysfunction. This kidney function is actually them further worsened by the hypertension and ultimately all of this.  It's in kidney failure, which can have very severe and potentially even life-threatening complications such as anemia, electrolyte imbalances such as metabolic acidosis and heart arrhythmias. Now before we dive into the mechanism of diabetic nephropathy, let's briefly review the structure of the glomerulus in the kidney by bringing in a diagram here. So the glomerulus is the portion of the kidney where blood is initially filtered. So blood enters the glomerulus over here through this,  This efferent arteriole and then leaves the glomerulus through the efferent arteriole and you can remember this that it leaves through the efferent arteriole for E4 exit or efferent. And while the blood is within the glomerulus. There's this Advanced filtration system, which we'll talk about more in a minute and the filtered fluid that exits the blood is known as the filtrate and it collects in Bowman's space before it enters into the tubules of the Nephron where further reabsorption and secretion.  Kurz before it exits the kidney into the ureters as urine. Now one last structure to point out in this diagram is this vessel coming off the efferent who you'll hear now this vasculature actually wraps around the tubules of the Nephron and contributes to the reabsorption and secretion of solutes now to add to this diagram. Let's imagine we took a cross section of this climb areolas and looked at it on its end and it would look a little bit something like this now we can use this diagram here to better.  Picked some of the important structures within the glomerulus. So here you can see the capillary vessels and each of them. I've drawn in here a little red blood cell to help remind you that it's a blood cell and as you can see these vessels are surrounded by a few additional structures that we couldn't really appreciate in that first diagram. So these are the structures that contribute to the three layered filtration system of the glomerulus the first layer is that of the vascular endothelium. So the endothelial cover the inside of the blood vessel so that  Capillary wall there and then the second layer is the glomerular basement membrane or GBM for short which is a specialized basement membrane that surrounds the vascular endothelium.  And then the last filtration layer is the visceral epithelium, which is also known as the podocytes now in between all of these capillaries here is the museum which is comprised of cells known conveniently as mesangial cells and they produce a collagen Network that structurally supports all of these capillaries and it's across this space that filtration occurs within the glomerulus of the kidney. So how exactly does diabetes a problem with in.  And divisions that result in kidney damage. Well, the answer includes multiple compounding factors. Now, the first component is an increased pressure state within the nephron and this is due to two mechanisms. And the first is hypertension, which is a common comorbidity associated with diabetes mellitus. So hypertension or high blood pressure results in an increased pressure throughout the entire arterial vascular system, and this includes the afferent arteriole of the glomerulus.  And so to think about how this increases the pressure within the glomerulus, let's think about a simple garden hose. So in the middle of the garden hose, there's a whole and as water flows through the hose a small amount of water will leak out through this hole. But if we open up this bigot all the way this is going to increase the pressure of the water traveling through the hose and intuitively this change is going to result in more water leaking from the hole here in the center and that's because there's  Increased pressure forcing it out of the hole. Now. This is similar to what occurs in the glomerulus the hypertension increases the pressure just like turning on that spigot which in return increases the filtration rate of the glomerulus, which can be thought of that leakiness from the hole in the garden hose. Now the other mechanism contributing to this high-pressure state is something known as vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole, which is just a fancy way of saying that this blood vessel constructs or get smaller in diameter.  So to understand why this occurs we need to briefly review the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system or Ras for short. So renin is a hormone that's secreted by the kidneys in response to decrease renal perfusion or low blood flow to the kidney. And this is a sign of low fluid volume throughout the body. So in response to a low fluid volume renin has a Cascade of effects in order to maintain blood pressure as well as volume status.  And one of these effects is constriction of the efferent arteriole which then maintains this pressure within the glomerulus in the presence of a decreased renal perfusion. So once again, let's go back to this garden hose to understand this a little bit better now instead of turning turning up the spigot as we did before. What do you think would happen if you were to Kink the hose on the other side of the hole once again intuitively. This is going to increase the pressure behind the Kink and subsequently.  Increase the rate at which water leaks out of the hole. So once again, this is similar to what occurs in the glomerulus in response to activation of this renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. There's a constriction of the efferent arteriole to build up pressure within the glomerulus to maintain the necessary filtration. And therefore it will increase the filtration rate even further, but why exactly is this happening if I just said that individuals with diabetes often have increased renal perfusion due to the hypertension then  why is a low pressure system such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activated and it's a good question and the answer is not exactly intuitive for some reason the underlying physiology of diabetes specifically the hyperglycemia results in a direct intra renal or within the kidney activation of this renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and subsequently efferent vasoconstriction independent of the volume status of the individual and therefore increases the globe.  Either filtration rate. So how does this increase pressure relate to diabetic nephropathy. Well as a pressure within the glomerulus increases this results in a process known as mesangial expansion The increased pressure results in trauma and damage to them as an geum of the glomerulus and in responses to damage the mesangial cells respond by secreting cytokines that produce inflammation as well as oxygen free radicals that result in endothelial dysfunction.  And all of this kind of combines into hypertrophy and Matrix accumulation within the Byzantium, which is known as mesangial expansion. And as you can see over here on the right as the museum expands the spaces or what are known as the fenestrations between the podocytes foot processes expand. Now this has two effects first, it decreases the surface area available within the glomerulus for filtration and second the dilation of the fenestrations.  Causes the filtration system to be leaky and larger molecules such as proteins are filtered out of the blood in the kidney. Then the last Factor contributing to diabetic nephropathy is a combination of the previously mentioned factors and this is ischemia. As I mentioned earlier the blood vessels supplying the tubules of the Nephron come off of the efferent arteriole and vasoconstriction of this arterial from the intra-regional activation of the Rena.  Angiotensin aldosterone system decreases this blood flow and in addition the cytokines and free radicals produced from the barrel trauma to the museum further damage the nephron vasculature and over time these processes result in ischemia or cell death and atrophy of the vasculature that supports the glomerulus as well as the two bills. So this will decrease the kidneys ability to filter blood and is ultimately what will lead to  Kidney, failure and diabetic nephropathy. So as you can see there are many different mechanisms that are going to contribute to the progression of kidney failure in individuals with diabetes mellitus. However, it's important to note that they are all directly associated with the underlying hyperglycemia. And therefore the progression towards kidney failure can be slow or potentially even prevented if the underlying diabetes is well controlled.\",\n",

       " 'f_4Q9Iv7_Ao': \"All right away and get drunk is because a little bit of the alcohol is metabolized by the brain. Actually, what goes to the brain is less than 10% of the alcohol. The majority of it about 80% gets metabolized by the liver. This is why you can develop all sorts of serious liver issues quite quickly. If you're drinking on a daily basis. However, your liver is a very powerful organ that can handle various toxins relatively. Well, so one night of celebrating your birthday, at the bar isn't going to have, you're trying to get on the liver transplant list.  But what if we can make an alcoholic drink with a special type of alcohol that didn't get metabolized in the brain. So you wouldn't experience the acute effects of alcohol toxicity. You could have several beers at lunch and still be sharp as a tack during the company meeting at 2 p.m. Maybe you could even be allowed to drink and drive because it wouldn't impair your motor skills. Companies might even get away with marketing, this special alcohol to kids, I present to you.  Kabir. Hey, I mean, if the kid isn't slurring his words and falling down, it should be okay, right? Well, of course not no parent in their right mind would give their kid alcohol simply because they don't appear drunk. So, here are the immediate health effects and the long-term health effects that come with alcohol consumption. How would you feel about a substance that doesn't get metabolized in the brain? So you get none of these immediate effects and you only have to worry about eight of these 12 problems from frequent consumption.  It still not. Okay with that. I'm guessing.  Well, we already have a substance like this. That is consumed on a daily basis, like alcohol. It's not necessary for any biochemical reaction in the body. You don't need it to survive. It's not metabolized in the brain. So it doesn't get you drunk. But, like, alcohol. And other toxins, it's processed primarily in the liver and frequent consumption of it leads to all sorts of health problems. This substance is fructose table. Sugar sucrose is made up of one, molecule of glucose and one molecule of fructose.  It's fructose is in honey. It's in fruit juice is in high fructose corn syrup. It's what makes the really sweet stuff. Sweet. Okay. Now you wouldn't think twice about not giving your kid a Budweiser.  But you don't think twice about giving your kid a can of Coke.  But they're the same.  This is Robert lustig. He's one of the biggest factors in bringing the detrimental effects of sugar to light at first. He can sound a bit over-the-top, when talking about sugar. Sugar is poison. It is a chronic dose-dependent HEPA, do liver toxin. However, he can back all of these statements up with more than 16 years of medical research academic, discourse, policy analysis data analysis, a whole lot of patient care. And maybe the most important, the biochemistry of how  Is processed in the body. There's all sorts of compelling statistics. We could talk about but the actual mechanisms that cause sugar to have such bad effects in the body, paint a much clearer picture. Once you understand how sugar is processed in the body, it leaves very little debate as to whether or not sugar could be considered a toxin and you start to see how a lot of modern health issues are caused by sugar.  Let's look at how sugar is metabolized. But first, we'll look at glucose or starch to see how a non-toxic carbohydrate is metabolized. By the way, it's not necessary to remember all these specific terms that come up, just pay attention to how glucose flows through the cells. So we can see how it's different from alcohol, and sugar. So here's what's happening in the liver. When you eat something, like a slice of white bread. First off, only 20% of the glucose. You ate will actually hit the liver because the other 80% is  I all the other cells in your body before. Glucose can get into the liver cell. It needs to stimulate the pancreas to make insulin. The insulin will stimulate this insulin receptor, irs-1, which causes a series of reactions to then stimulate srebp one, and activate. This enzyme called glucokinase, glucokinase takes glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, which mostly gets stored in the liver. As glycogen glycogen is a good thing.  Because it acts as the reserve tank of energy that your body can access when necessary. This is why Runners will carb load before a race to completely fill up their glycogen stores and have more energy during the race. Then what is just sitting in their gut? What doesn't go to glycogen gets metabolized down to pyruvate pyruvate enters. The mitochondria, mitochondria is like the coal furnace of your cell because it converts the pyruvate to acetyl co a then Burns that in the TCA cycle.  Temper, Deuce a bunch of energy in the form of ATP. Not all of this is going to get burned off. So a little bit, maybe leftover as citrate the srebp one from before activates these three enzymes to start a process called de novo. Lipogenesis. De novo new, lipo fat Genesis making. So the cell is taking this leftover citrate and converting it into fat. The liver really doesn't want the fat sitting around inside it. So it gets  Inverted down to something called vldl which is stored in your fat tissue. Not only can this make you fat, but vldl is actually a big contributor to heart disease. Well, this might sound bad is actually not that big of a deal because remember only 20% of the glucose made it to the liver then half of that went to glycogen then a lot of that is burned off for energy. So maybe 1/50 of what you ate will actually turn into vldl. So could a farmer who's eating rice and vegetables at every meal died of a heart attack.  Maybe, but it's gonna happen when they're about age 90. So that's not too bad. So now let's look at ethanol which is drinking alcohol to see what makes it so different from glucose. Here's what happens in the liver. When you have an alcoholic drink as you can, guess ethanol is not necessary for any biological process. So a majority of it is processed like a toxin in the liver. 10% will get process in the stomach and intestines, and another 10% gets processed by the kidneys muscle and the Brain.  This is the first big difference between glucose and ethanol. The liver has to work four times as hard because it processes 80% of the alcohol that comes in. Ethanol, doesn't need insulin to get into the cell. It just diffuses in there and is converted to acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde generates. Something called reactive oxygen species, reactive oxygen species, damaged proteins in the body can cause cancer and are thought to be the key factor in aging. This is how antioxidants are supposed to combat aging.  King because they deal with these are os's, the acetaldehyde then gets converted down to acetate and goes into the mitochondria. Like last time with glucose only 20% of the substrate, one to the liver and maybe half of what went to the liver. Went to the mitochondria, because the rest went to glycogen. So what alcohol is doing is overloading your mitochondria. So a bunch of acetate comes in goes through the TCA cycle and  Left with a ton of citrate, the same three enzymes that start new fad making are stimulated, and you end up with a lot of bad fat. This will go to your fat stores. Primarily your visceral fat. This is the stuff that causes a lot of health issues and surrounds your organs giving you a big gut. This is why people get beer bellies because that's the area that gets filled with the fat produced by alcohol.  So the liver has all this fat being produced that it doesn't want sitting around inside it. So it will also export some of the fat out in the form of free fatty acids. These can get into the muscle causing muscle insulin resistance, which is very problematic. Some of the fat won't even be able to get out of the liver. So you have a fan droplet, just sitting in the liver. And now you have your alcoholic fatty liver disease.  So, the excess of a Sukhoi, the ethanol and the reactive oxygen species activate an enzyme called J and K 1, which is the bridge between metabolism and inflammation. This ends up further damaging the liver and it promotes insulin resistance within the liver by inactivating irs-1, that insulin receptor from before this means your pancreas has to work a lot harder and pump more insulin out to do its job.  Now, let's look at Sugar. Sugar is made up of equal parts, glucose and fructose. Fructose is what causes the problem. So, let's see how it is metabolized very similarly to ethanol. Here's what's going on in the liver. When you have a glass of something sweet, like orange juice. First off like ethanol fructose is not necessary to the body. So it's treated like a foreign substance and almost 100 percent of it is processed in the liver. It comes in gets metabolized down to pyruvate.  Enters the mitochondria. Now, we have the same situation where everything goes straight to the liver does not get stored in glycogen and overload, your liver cells mitochondria. The pyruvate goes through the TCA cycle produces a bunch of citrate and that gets converted down to vldl. This leads to increased risk of heart disease and visceral fat accumulation. Now, you've got a soda belly like before it also exits, the cell as free fatty acids, leading to insulin resistance in the  Muscle. Not all the fat can get out of this cell so fat accumulates in the liver and now you get non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.  The same, jnk one gets stimulated. Which promotes inflammation and jnk, one acts on the same IRS. Insulin receptor causing insulin resistance in the liver.  All of this is actually Illustrated really well in the movie that Sugar film Damon Gamo goes on a diet, with plenty of low-fat and so-called healthy foods, like yogurt, whole grain cereals fruit juice, and fruit smoothies. The aim is to eat foods that are marketed as healthy while reaching the average sugar intake of a typical Australian, which is about 40 teaspoons, his results, demonstrate all of these biochemical processes. We just talked about, he gained eight point, five kilograms and an extra seven percent total body.  D fat mainly in the form of visceral fat. His heart disease risk went up. He's developed insulin resistance. And after only 18 days, he developed, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. What I thought was interesting was that he didn't change the amount of calories. He was consuming yet. He packed on such a significant amount of fat. Actually. There's another element to fructose metabolism that makes it generate so much fat fructose form. Something called xylose 5 phosphate.\",\n",
       " 'FHjK1dwlpm0': \"My fellow NIH patients. So a lot of this may be oriented to NIH, but I think it's probably holds true for researching outside of the clinical Center in the NIH.  So why do patients participate in clinical trials? So they're really basically two types of patients.  Those who are healthy who want to participate and help others by contributing to medical research and advancing science. And those who are sick, those who are ill, who may have been referred.  By outside private physicians or horn who herself referred and that's more and more the case these days.  And many cases, they've exhausted all other options to take advantage. They come here to take advantage and sometimes the experimental and sometimes potentially risky treatments, but that are often inaccessible in any other way. And many are looking forward, really looking for medical miracles.  and my thesis is,  That it's important and beneficial for you as researchers to form a partnership with your patient. Volunteers, a partnership that's based on trust and understanding a partnership of peers, one that ultimately advances medicine. And also ultimately saves lives to be successful. Your research will in some measure, be dependent on the cooperation of your patient. Volunteers, their confidence in. You will help us.  Rush a positive relationship. One that can be extremely helpful to you and for the outcome of your study.  At the heart of this partnership for patient and scientists. The like is the basic optimism and hope for a positive outcome.  So I've created an acronym that hopefully is appropriate as we discuss this and I call the this queue.  C is for communication, you understanding and easy for empathy.  Communication verbal and non verbal verbal skills, you know, you only have one chance to make an initial impression and it's my position that the principal investigator should be present and take the time for you and investigator to be thorough in a very private setting. You must explain the role of fellows or investigators as the case may be and that you're not push for an initial decision from  the patient to make a that decision to continue to proceed with with the  project.  You need to have a full explanation of every aspect of how the process will work. And understand that patients may be intimidated and overwhelmed, especially in their initial meeting and do encourage note-taking so that they can have a pretty good recall of what was discussed at the meeting.  Explain the risk, possible lifestyle effect changes while undergoing treatment. Will they be able to work? Will they take care of their family?  What will be the duration of the trial, their frequency of required visits? One of the transportation issues and possible cost? If any, and should they bring a caregiver? Make sure that this conversation isn't doesn't take place in hallways, or in the midst of a busy clinic, and respect by all means, respect their privacy.  Sitting when you're talking to your patient.  Conveys a sense of importance and a conversation of peers and make eye contact, it conveys a sense of direct engagement and that they have your complete attention and focus and listen, intently. No writing. No typing today in this world. It seems that so many clinicians when they're meeting with a patient are on their desktop typing away.  Or laptop typing away, and hardly making eye contact with the patient. I have to tell you from personal experience. That is extremely off-putting.  so listen, intently and  Type after the visit and review your patient's file in history before, not during the meeting, think? Think through in advance, the likely questions or those that should be asked and cover them, even if the patient doesn't ask understand that, the experience can be intimidating overwhelming and give them time to absorb and encourage note-taking. Be totally accessible between clinical.  Presents. You can be assured that that particularly the first visit but perhaps on ensuing visits as well. The patient is not going to really be able to absorb everything that you say they're going to be questions that arise after she or he leaves you. So be totally accessible between clinic visits return phone calls and emails in a timely fashion.  Being able to stay in contact with the researcher, is extremely important. And if you respond quickly, it does show a sense of your regard for this person and your interest in their well-being. And if the situation warrants, it keep outside primary care, physicians regularly apprised of developments.  Understanding.  Listening is more than a nine-letter. Word. You need to assess the patient volunteers understanding. Do they really get it? Be careful of the overuse of medical. Jargon translate technical terms and understand that many returning patients have been coming for years, their knowledge and understanding of their illness and research may possibly be greater than yours as a new fellow or researcher.  It's an indication of respect for you to recognize and acknowledge this.  Respect and encourage patient, volunteers own research. I'm sure you're aware that everybody is on the internet these days and more than likely those patients who have that degree of interest and availability of computers will be on their Google site and and looking for as much information as they can. And some of this research is not going to be accurate, but respectfully correct, their Miss information and direct them.  Reliable sources be honestly optimistic. No, false. Hope.  But accentuate the positive without eliminating the negative understand patients, previously, treated in the private sector may feel that the clinical research environment is intimidating and a bit off-putting, be sensitive to that and make certain that patients understand that they can discontinue participation in the trial at any time without any negative consequences to subsequent treatment.  Please never use the fact that patients are referred are receiving free care. This can be offensive to patients.  So, rather enforce, the idea that they are very in a very important component, to the overall process of clinical research and this process could not be done without them. Remember that, the so-called free care is often experimental and sometimes comes with potential risk for the patient.  Empathy.  The act of Simply coming to most large medical facilities in the entire initial experience. And even subsequent visits can be intimidating and overwhelming, ill patients can be exercised, emotional. Remember for some you will represent their last hope.  Some patients have complained that being treated there being treated like guinea, pigs, or Lab Rats and feel that they're only valued is to provide data and resent being made to feel this way. So, go out of your way to this abuse, your patience of this feeling and make them understand and believe that you truly care about their welfare.  Time management, don't act rushed the worst thing that can I think that can set a patient off is for a clinician to come into the examining room and say, well, I only have a few minutes to talk to you. So let's get on with this. What, what could be more important at that particular moment in time than to go face-to-face with your patient.  Be on time long Clinic, weights.  I really disrespectful and off-putting and to sick and anxious patients. It's extremely off-putting. I can give testimony that having sat in some clinics and waited for an extraordinary long time for. Excuse me, my fellow to come join me. So please put that in your book and and do make it a an extreme effort.  The difficult conversation.  Delivering, bad news.  Every patient is a very real.  And unique person with genuine fears and hopes and not just an experiment in your lad. A - diagnosis can include the perception. That life is one has lived. It is gone forever and there may be little hope for the future.  It may require a stretch but I suggest that you try to stretch to put yourself in the patients.\",\n",

And with that, she saw a number of other acromegaly patients, so she was able to spot the symptoms without that. I don't think that I would have been diagnosed.  After I was diagnosed, I met with the team neurosurgeon and an endocrinologist and they decided that it was best that I receive surgery first, to do bulk. Most of my tumor, the results of having residual tumor in my brain, is that now I need to follow up with radiation and medication. In order to continue to treat the igf-1 levels that are still in my bloodstream.  Despite being on my medication for for 25 years. It took that long for me to get relief from my symptoms of fatigue.

I'm extremely lucky to have the family support that I have a support, system is so vital with this disease.  I decided to go to the airport, the last acromegaly conference kind of on a whim and part of the agonizing community on Facebook. And I had seen that this conference was coming up. And I have a very good friend that has kind of been with me through thick and thin and she jumped, right onboard and decided that she wanted to come with me. She was unbelievably supportive the entire time that she was there and took notes to better notes than I did. And  One of the most incredible things was when she looked at me and just said, I can't believe that this is what you guys deal with every day. It was like somebody finally got it after surgery and radiation. I started on my monthly injection after that to network. Then we went to daily injections as well as the monthly injection and then I had to work my son.

       " 'FkkK5lTmBYQ': 'A biological individual consists of multiple organs with specialized functions for the organism to function properly in its environment. These organs must communicate this communication often involves a signal sent from one location to another that instructs. The second organ about the status of some cellular feature. Glucose is a good example, glucose is a critical product of digestion. It is an essential energy source for cellular metabolism. This energy is produced when glucose is used as a substrate for glycolysis and the Krebs or citric acid. Cycle following the digestion of food, higher levels of glucose circulate through the bloodstream where it enters different cell types.  In muscle cells, glucose is readily used to produce energy and is also stored as glycogen, a secondary, short-term energy source.  In fat cells. Glucose is used for triglyceride production and acts as an important energy. Reserve molecule.  Here, we will illustrate the signaling pathway that occurs when glucose is at high levels. This pathway involves multiple proteins and signaling events. This is termed. Cytoplasmic signaling. Different types of cells, perform similar signaling steps in response to changes in their environment.  In the protein recycling animation. We see a group of storage, vesicles enriched with glute for proteins, continuously recycling from the cell membrane to an inactive location. In the cytosol glute for is a protein that facilitates the movement of glucose into the cell.  When high levels of glucose are detected by beta cells in the pancreas, insulin is released by the cells, the insulin circulates through the bloodstream until it binds to an insulin receptor embedded, in the cell membrane of a muscle fat or brain cell. Once the insulin binds to the receptor, phosphate groups are added to the intracellular domain of the receptor.  Since the receptor itself, adds the phosphate groups. The process is called Auto. Phosphorylation this, phosphorylation event sets off, a Cascade of molecular events, the activated receptor protein, then adds a phosphate group to another closely associated protein. This effectively passes, the signal from the receptor to the next step in the signal pathway.  Proteins, that add phosphate groups to another protein are called kinases, kinases are often components of signal Pathways and phosphorylation is an important component in the transmission of a signal, from one compartment to another. In this system. The signal corresponds to the level of blood glucose and is transmitted from outside to inside the cell.  Next, we see a large pool of molecules that are embedded in the membrane. Also being phosphorylated, other proteins are then. In turn phosphorylated. Further transmitting the first extracellular signal that was originally sent from outside the cell membrane.  So, how does this affect the uptake of glucose? As we mentioned before glute for is a glucose transporter and glute for storage. Vesicles are held in a recycling State near the cell membrane. The vesicles are held mostly in this region because the RAB proteins that interact with the motor proteins, necessary to move the vesicles to the membrane are in an inactive state.  A final step in this signal pathway, involves the phosphorylation of a protein that prevents the RAB proteins from interacting with the vesicles.  When the rap proteins are no longer inhibited, the storage, vesicles can freely merge with the membrane.  Once the vesicles have merged many glute for proteins, are embedded in the membrane and large quantities of glucose, can move into the cell.  It is the signaling pathway that ensures only the correct molecules will be allowed to enter the target cell.',\n",

       " 'fR3NxCR9z2U': \"I weigh about 80 kg most of that. Let's say 64 percent is water, though. You can't tell by looking. I mean, it's organisms go. I like to think that I look fairly solid. After water. The next largest proportion of me is protein about 16 percent and not just in my muscles, but also in things like the tiny sodium-potassium pumps in my neurons and the hemoglobin and my blood and the enzymes driving, the chemical reactions and every one of my 37 trillion cells. And another 16% of me is fat which I'm totally okay. With four percent of me is minerals like the calcium and phosphorus and my  bones and the iron in my blood and 1% is carbohydrates. Most of which is either being consumed as I talk to you or is sitting around as glycogen waiting to be used. But here's the thing. It's not like I just ate 80 kg of food and then all this happened is that my body like yours is constantly acquiring stuff, extracting, some of it to keep burning some of it for energy and getting rid of the rest and even the stuff that my body does hold onto doesn't last forever. Some of the chemicals that I absorb in my food eventually become a part of me but enzymes, we're out in, membranes breakdown, India.  It gets oxidized so they get discarded and then I need more of those chemicals to reconstruct. The material that I've lost as a result over the course of my lifetime. My cells will synthesize somewhere between 225 and 450 kilograms of protein that's like three or four or five separate mean. He's just made of protein and all the protein and fat and carbohydrates, and nucleic acids that make up me, of course, come from food. Every organism has to keep taking in and breaking down food to keep resupplying itself with the raw materials it needs.  I survived and all that activity requires energy, which we also gained from food. So how do our bodies actually convert? What we eat into energy and raw materials. The answer is a never-ending series of reactions that are dedicated to doing to vital and totally contradictory things. One set of chemical reactions destroys the reactants that you give them reducing big complex, substances into molecular rubble and the other set reassembles that Rubble into new and bigger products that are put together again to make you. So our bodies are constantly Reinventing.  The selves in a Perpetual state of loss, but also always rebuilding. And even though, all of this is happening at the cellular level, its consequences, could hardly be larger. These two sets of reactions are where everything that we've learned so far about the Digestive endocrine circulatory and respiratory, systems really starts to come together together. These processes make up your metabolism.  Now the science keyword metabolism, has come to have a meaning in popular speech but metabolism isn't just. One thing people talk about metabolism is meeting like how fast your body burns, the fuel in your food, or how high your personal energy level is, and that's fine for use by personal trainers and fitness magazines, but physiologically metabolism really describes every single biochemical reaction that goes,  In your body and maybe more importantly it reconciles to conflicting. Chemical processes that are always simultaneously underway inside of you. One of those chemical forces is anabolism anabolic reactions and construct things and consume energy. These are the processes that take the small monomer building blocks in your food, like monosaccharides and fatty and amino acids and build them into bigger. More complex polymers like carbs and fats and proteins that are used in your cells. Then when you need new building blocks, or you need to release some energy, those polymers in your body, or  Or new ones in your food, get broken up by catabolic reactions, the processes of catabolism breakdown bigger molecules, and then breaking their bonds, release the energy. You need to stay warm and move around and provide yourselves with fuel to build. Those polymers. Back up again. To be honest. Your metabolism is a lot like Sisyphus it works really hard but it is never finished and the boulder that your inner Sisyphus is always pushing uphill and watching fall back down. That's nutrients. The molecules that your body is forever breaking up and then rebuilding only  Have them break apart again, and these nutrients, the materials that your body needs to build maintain and repair itself. Come in six, major groups by volume. The majority of what we consume and what makes up our bodies is water. So that's maybe the most vital nutrients. And there are vitamins compounds that come in either fat soluble or water soluble forms. They aren't used as building blocks or for energy, but they're essential in helping the body. Make use of other nutrients that do, do those things vitamin C. For example, helps improve iron absorption while Vitamin K is crucial to blood clots.  Adding and some B vitamins are important in the production of ATP from glucose minerals, like vitamins, don't provide fuel, but they have all sorts of other functions house, IAM, magnesium, and phosphorus Harden bones. And teeth. While iron is, of course, crucial and hemoglobin plus potassium, sodium and chlorine help maintain your body's pH balance and are used in action potential. So water, vitamins and minerals are all necessary. But the three major nutrients that everyone always talks about the ones you find on food labels from oatmeal. The Pop-Tarts are carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins.  To the carbohydrates you've ever eaten with the exception of lactose in milk. Originally came from Plants mono and disaccharides come from fruits, honey. Sugar beets and sugar cane while polysaccharide starch has come from veggies and Grains. The main thing you need to know is that the monosaccharides glucose is the be-all end-all, molecular fuel that your cells need to make ATP ATP? Being the molecule that your cells used to drive anabolic reactions when they need to make new polymers or get anything else done, whether that's operating a sodium, potassium, pump or detach,  Being the head of a myosin filament to contract a muscle, but ATP is too unstable to store. So cells, often store energy in the form of glucose, which they can then catabolize and convert to a tee pee when they need it. Now, some of your cells can get their energy from fat, somebody the most important ones like your neurons and red blood cells feed exclusively on glucose. So, most of the carbs that your intestines absorb are converted to glucose for that reason, but if it's not needed right away, that energy can also get stored as glycogen in your liver and muscles or converted to glycerol and fatty acids to make triglyceride.  And even though there seems to be some kind of marketing war going on against dietary fats. We most definitely need them. The fats in your adipose tissue store energy, of course, but they also store fat soluble vitamins and cushion your organs. If it's also form the myelin that insulates, the neurons in your brain and throughout your body, as well as the oil in your skin, and they provide the vital calorie content found in breast milk, but there are other important lipids like cholesterol, which is the precursor to things like testosterone and estrogen, and of course, phospholipids, which form the cell membrane. And every single one of the three.  Dozen or so trillion cells you have now, if you're into eating meat a lot of the fat you ingest might come from that but guess what plants have fat two plants use lipids for energy storage just like we do except they do it in fruits and nuts and seeds which when you think of it are kind of like plant breast milk its food for their growing babies. Either way, though, when you eat lipids, your body breaks down, triglycerides into glycerol and fatty acids. Those molecules can then be processed and used in the making of ATP or they might be converted into other kinds of fatty acids, which your cells can then reassemble them to your  Your own triglycerides are phospholipids and your liver happens to be great at converting one fatty acid into another, but there are some it just can't synthesize. For example. Omega 6 and 3 fatty acids are called essential fatty acids because your body can't make them. So they have to be ingested. Think it turned into all kinds of useful molecules like the ones used for synapse formation in the brain and for signaling inflammation during the healing process, but if carbohydrates provide energy and fats insulate and store energy than just about everything else is done with,  Teens say, formed the bulk of your muscle and connective tissue, but they're also. What the ion channels and pumps are made of in your neurons and muscle cells. And they make up your enzymes which are responsible for pretty much every chemical reaction in your body. In other words, your body runs on protein and pretty much is protein. Nutritionally, speaking Meats, dairy products, eggs legumes nuts, cereals are all particularly high in protein, but because everything we eat was once alive and every cell of every living thing, contains protein, as long as you're eating Whole Foods, you're at least.  Partially restocking, your protein supplies. I might seem like you'd have to eat muscle to make muscle or eat enzymes to make enzymes, but that's not how it works. Since all your proteins are made up of just 20 amino acids. The differences between the thousands of unique proteins are simply in the sequence of those amino acids. And of course you have a specialized molecule that knows just which amino acids to put together in what order to make a certain protein is called DNA. When you consume some hamburger, for example, the protein actin in the meat gets catabolized into its component. Amino acids, which  It's mixed up with all of the amino acids from all the other proteins in the meat, like the collagen and elastin and tighten and myosin as well as all the proteins from the bond and the tomato, and the mayonnaise, those amino acids then get reassembled, using anabolic reactions into your very own but somewhat different proteins. As defined by your DNA Edsel is like, a picky little Gordon Ramsay, and it has to have every amino acid needed every ingredient present before it will even think about starting to make a protein and just like, with your lipids, your cells can improvise. And  Some amino acids into others, if they're missing an ingredient. However, there are nine essential amino acids that you cannot make from others and have to eat. And I, lots of foods don't provide every essential amino acid, but when you combine foods like beans, and rice or pasta and cheese, you do get all of the essential amino acids, which is important. Because remember, after water, you are mostly made of protein on the order of 16 percent. But what about the 1% of you, with the carbohydrates, how that tiniest fraction of you ends up, creating all of the energy is what we'll discover.  Next time. But for now, you've learned all about the vital nutrients including water vitamins, minerals, carbs, fats and proteins, as well as how anabolic reactions build structures and require energy while catabolic reactions tear things apart and release energy and together these competing forces form, the wonderfully conflicted process known as metabolism.

       " 'fRZduVxlP_U': \"Studies dating back nearly a century noted a striking. Finding if you take young healthy people split them up into two groups, half on a fat Rich diet and half on a carb Rich diet within just two days. This is what happens. The glucose intolerance skyrockets in the fat group in response to the same sugar challenge, the group that had been shoveling in fat and it up with twice, the blood sugar as the amount of fat in the diet goes up. So does our blood sugar spikes? Why would eating fat lead to higher blood sugar levels? It would take scientists nearly seven decades to unravel this mystery, but it would end up holding the key to our current understanding of the cause of type 2 diabetes.  The reason athletes carb load before a race is to build up the fuel supply within their muscles, right? We break down the starch into glucose in our digestive tract. It circulates as blood glucose, also known as blood sugar and it's taken up by our muscles to be stored and burned for energy. Blood sugar though is like a vampire needs an invitation to come into ourselves. And that invitation is insulin. Here's a muscle cell. Here's some blood sugar outside, waiting patiently to.  Come in insulin is the key that unlocks the door to let sugar in our blood enter the muscle cell when insulin attaches to the insulin receptor. It activates an enzyme which activates another enzyme, which activates two more enzymes with finally activates glucose transport, which acts as a Gateway for glucose to enter the cell. So insulin is the key that unlocks the door into our muscle cells.  What if there was no insulin though? Well, blood sugar will be stuck on the bloodstream, banging on the door to our muscles, and not be able to get inside. And so with nowhere to go, sugar levels would rise and Rise. That's what happens. In type 1 diabetes, the cells in the pancreas that make insulin get destroyed and without insulin sugar. In the blood can't get out of the blood into the muscles and blood sugar Rises. But there's a second way, we could end up with high blood sugar. What if there's enough?  Insulin, but the insulin doesn't work. The key is there but something, something's gummed up the lock. This is called insulin resistance. Our muscle cells become resistant to the effect of insulin. What's gumming up the door, locks and our muscle cells preventing insulin, from letting sugar in fat, what's called intra, Maya, cellular lipid, fat inside our muscle cells.  Fat in the bloodstream can build up inside the muscle cell creating toxic fatty breakdown products and free radicals, that can block the signaling pathway process. So no matter how much insulin we have out in our blood. It's not able to open the glucose Gates and blood sugar levels. Build up in the blood. This mechanism by which fat induces insulin resistance wasn't known until fancy. MRI techniques were developed to see what was happening. Inside people's muscles.  As fat was infused into their bloodstream, that's how we found out that elevation of fat levels in the blood causes insulin resistance, by the inhibition of glucose transport into the muscles. And this can happen within three hours. One hit of fat can start causing insulin resistance. Inhibiting glucose uptake after just 160 minutes.  Same thing happens to teens you, infuse fat into their bloodstream. It builds up in their muscles and decreases, their insulin sensitivity showing that increased fat in the blood is an important contributor of insulin resistance and then you can do the opposite experiment, lower the level of fat and people's blood and the insulin resistance comes right down, clear the fat out of the blood and you can clear the sugar out of the blood, so that explains  This finding on a high fat. Ketogenic diet, insulin doesn't work very well, our bodies become insulin resistant. But as the amount of fat in our diet gets lower and lower insulin works better and better.  This is a clear demonstration that the sugar tolerance of even healthy individuals can be impaired by administering. A low-carb high-fat diet, but we can decrease insulin resistance by decreasing fat intake.\",\n",
       " 'fSYFsrurYKI': \"Development of type 1 diabetes mellitus by dr. Michael agus. Hi and welcome. I'll be speaking today about diabetic ketoacidosis or dka. My name is Michael agus. I'm a pediatric intensive care doctor and a pediatric endocrinologist at Boston Children's Hospital. I'm the director of the medicine Critical Care Program here at Children's and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. I'll start by explaining how one gets diabetes to begin with because it's a surprise to many that diabetes really occurs develops over a period of many many months when endocrinologists in Boston set up the diabetes prevention trial or DPT one several years ago. Although we weren't able to stop the onset of diabetes. We were able to track people getting diabetes and the way we chose. Those the most likely people to get diabetes were to look at first degree relatives of patients with diabetes. We know that patients who are about to get diabetes have a genetic predisposition and then they have some environmental component that occurs at some point in their life. We don't understand what that what that environmental component is, but we understand that if you have that genetic predisposition you are at risk to be affected by  By the environmental exposure when I try to identify patients at increased risk, those first-degree relatives. So siblings parents children instead of having the usual background rate in the North American population, for example of 0.5 percent roughly of type 1 diabetes people who have a first degree relative with diabetes are at a tenfold increased risk and are now have a  Five percent incidence of type 1 diabetes. So you went from one to 200 to 1 and 20.  By following these people who are at increased risk of getting diabetes. We can understand that they begin to lose beta cell function months and months and months prior to the onset of clinical symptoms of diabetes. So if we created if we were going to take an example of a child who is developing diabetes, we could look at this particular graph and you see that even though she didn't know she was on her way to get diabetes. She's been losing.  Beta cell function beta cell Mass from autoimmune destruction over a period of many months when she's at the point that you see here. There's no symptoms whatsoever. She has enough insulin to cover the the meals cover her basil production when she moves to the next step. She has intermittent hyperglycemia that refers to the fact that when she has a large carbohydrate load and  Ice cream sundae for example blood sugar may go up into the to 300. She may get a little flush. She may have increased urine output because her glucose is exceeded the renal threshold of 180 milligrams per deciliter, but she'll have an extra cup of water maybe a little bit thirsty and come right back down into the mid to low 100s after that almost nobody gets diagnosed in that particular period with the rare exception.  Of a child of a mother with diabetes that's not a medical rule but it's a sociological reality that family member who has diabetes in particular mother will be much more Vigilant checking the child from the time. They're born doing a finger stick here and there when they have a tantrum when something doesn't look quite right and so those patients are likely to get diagnosed a little bit earlier.  Most patients will continue to lose beta cell function and move into this yellow zone of frequent hyperglycemia and with hyperglycemia again over the renal threshold of 180 get polyuria. And when you get when you lose that water, you'll get thirsty. So you get polydipsia and diagnosis at this point may have more to do with families sleep setup than anything else. If for example a child is going to share  The bathroom with the adults and they're going to notice the middle the night. They're getting up four times at night. They live in a massive house and or the child uses a different bathroom at maybe a lot longer period until the parents notice the child's getting up at night same thing at school depending on how Vigilant or how much the teacher notices but despite the difference in what the adults see what happens if the child is pretty identical and over a period of very  it's a couple of weeks the child become more and more symptomatic in retrospect one can often find symptoms. Well, well beyond just the two weeks of polydipsia and polyuria see a little bit of weight loss. Maybe some growth stunting may be some increased hunger because that way lost they're not able to sustain a normal weight if this period goes unnoticed the the page  Can progress to diabetic ketoacidosis and we'll talk about that in a minute the interesting thing? However, is it not all patients really have a clear history of two or three weeks of polydipsia and polyuria until they present with ketoacidosis rather. They're basically fine on Monday and then on Tuesday, they're in extremis quite ill and so if we go back and look at a patient who says in the green zone on  on a Monday what changes between Monday and Tuesday is that they lose beta cell Mass massive amount of beta cell function over a day that that can't be true because we know that it takes months and months and months up to 10 to 12 months to develop clinical diabetes so much more likely what happens is that they encounter stress and if you look at the the patient in the green zone when they go from Monday to Tuesday, what changes is  Their beta cell Mass. What changes is their insulin requirement? And what was enough insulin on Monday to keep them under control is suddenly on Tuesday not nearly enough and they throw them right into ketoacidosis. And so what could have happened between Monday and Tuesday to create that kind of differential and Insulin requirement? Well stress is a very straightforward answer and basically in childhood can be virtually any kind of stress can be viral.  Has can be dehydration. It can be an injury fever. Now. If we you know take one of those a viral illness and and look how it progresses through we see that any viral illness can lead to decreased water intake dehydration. And in any of us when we get a little bit of hiva lemic when we get a little bit of hypovolemia, we will begin to counter regulate with stress hormones are primarily those are cortisol and epinephrine, but there's a  Host of hormones catecholamines that have begin to get increase in the setting of stress and those give anybody a little bit of insulin resistance and so in somebody without diabetes that might bump their blood sugar from a baseline of you know, 82 Baseline of 95 still within the normal range but a slight increase why is it is a body triggering a response to increased blood sugar slightly. No one really understands that no one understands.  Has any survival benefit 295 for example already but in patients with evolving diabetes or with Frank diabetes a little bit of insulin resistance goes a long way from a blood glucose one of you and instead of bumping from 80 to 95. They go from 80 to a hundred eighty and then to 280 to 380 and as they hit that renal threshold of about 180 milligrams per deciliter. They will begin to spill a lot of urine and with that polyuria. They will lose even more  Get even more dehydrated Now counter regulate even more and as a result, they'll begin to develop even more significant insulin resistance that insulin resistance will become significant enough that instead of just increasing the glucose concentration. They'll begin to have significant Ketone production ketones are a weak acid, but in significant concentrations will give you a significant acidosis that will trigger even more counter regulation. Once you get into this cycle. There is no way out without  Any insulin, this is a spiral that untreated with insulin will result in death. This is the the death spiral to demonstrate that there are no case reports of somebody getting diabetic ketoacidosis and spontaneously survive the unless you get insulin therapy. There is no way out. The problem with dka is insulin deficiency.  In C and the cure for dka is insulin. Please help us improve the content by providing us with some feedback.\",\n",

       " 'Gazuoyf-lm4': \"Today we will be examining the concepts of relative clearance and urine to plasma ratios. This information will help us to solve problems about the reabsorption and secretion of various substances within the kidneys.  Clearance is a term that refers to the ability of the kidneys to clear a substance from the blood when a substance is excreted in the urine a certain volume of fluid is freed or cleared of that substance in this slide. We see a solute represented by a blue dot being filtered and secreted into the urine fluids are being represented by rectangles filled with water.  Clearance is defined as the volume of plasma from which that substance is completely removed per unit time.  It is measured in milliliters per minute. Renal clearance is not a measurement of the concentration of a solute in the plasma or urine.  We will be examining the clearance of three substances today glucose.  inulin  and pah or para Amina hip uric acid.  In the nephron each of these substances enters into the glomerulus and is freely filtered from the glomerular capillaries with a normal filtration fraction about one-fifth of the renal plasma flow passes into Bowman's space and the proximal tubule the other four-fifths of the renal plasma flow passes into the efferent arteriole and the peritubular capillaries.  Let's begin by looking at the movement of inulin within the nephron inulin is a 6000 molecular weight polysaccharide. It is used medically in renal function test.  Anyone is readily filtered at the glomerulus but is not secreted or reabsorbed. That's all of the filtered inulin remains in the tubulin is excreted in the body.  The water that was filtered with inulin is reabsorbed into the peritubular capillaries.  Consequently, the clearance of inulin can be used as a measure of the glomerular filtration rate or GFR.  Glucose is a monosaccharide with a molecular weight of 180 like inulin glucose is freely filtered at the glomerulus and one-fifth of the glucose passes into the to byul.  And low concentration. However, the entire filtered load of glucose is reabsorbed into the peritubular capillaries.  PH is the amide derivative of the amino acid Glycine and para Amino benzoic acid pH is used in the diagnostic testing of the kidney like inulin and glucose pah is freely filtered at the glomerulus and one-fifth of the pah passes into the tube. You'll in low concentration. All of the pah is secreted in one pass through the peritubular capillaries.  Consequently, the clearance of pah can be used as a measure of the renal plasma flow or RPF.  If we look at the final results for each of these three substances, they are rather different from one another for inulin. One-fifth of the inulin is excreted from the tube. You'll and four-fifths of the inulin would remain in the plasma for glucose. There's no glucose present in the urine and all of the glucose remains in the plasma for pah all of the pah in the plasma ends up in the urine.  the patterns of Transport we have just seen however were only characteristic of low concentrations of each of the solutes what happens when the concentration levels within the plasma increase  as the plasma concentration of inulin increases the filtered and non-filtered components increase in the same proportion.  Thus the fraction of inulin in the urine and plasma does not change consequently. The clearance of inulin is independent of the inulin concentration within the plasma.  as the plasma concentrations of glucose increase the filtered load of glucose also increases  as the glucose plasma concentrations reach about 3 milligrams per milliliter the glucose Transporters become overwhelmed.  Once the transport maximum of 360 milligrams per minute has been surpassed some of the filtered glucose will remain in the tube you'll and be excreted in the urine.  As the plasma concentration of pH Rises the transport maximum of 72 milligrams per minute for secretion may be exceeded.  At this point some of the pah will not be secreted as the blood passes through the peritubular capillaries. This pH will remain in the plasma compartment at extremely high concentrations of glucose or pah their clearance becomes closer to the clearance of inulin.  This equation uses the urine to plasma ratios of a substance X the urine flow rate here. We see the clearance equation for inulin, which is used to estimate the GFR.  It can be mathematically useful to compare the clearance of substances to inulin, which is an index of filtration. This information can be used to determine whether a substance is undergoing net reabsorption or net secretion within the Nephron.  If we use the UDP ratios of two different substances note that the urine flow rate is in the numerator and the denominator since the urine flow rate would be the same for both substances. This value can be eliminated when we use the equations.  Physiologist have used these ratios to develop the helpful skill shown here.  Inulin would have a UPN you villain concentration ratio value of 1 in un is an index of filtration and is neither reabsorbed nor secreted any substances that undergo net reabsorption would have a UDP ratio relative to inulin between 0 to 1, for example at low glucose concentrations the glucose to annual and you p ratio would have a value of zero.  This indicates that a hundred percent of the filtered load of glucose was reabsorbed into the peritubular capillaries.  UDP ratios with values from 1 to 5 indicate that the solute is undergoing that secretion since the filtration fraction is normally one-fifth the amount that any substance can be cleared over and above what is filtered would represent five times the filtered amount. For example pH has a value of five at low plasma concentrations. This indicates that 100% of the pah was secreted as it passed through the peritubular.  capillaries  As the concentration of pH in the systemic blood stream increases the UDP ratio would drop closer to 1.  The UW ratios can be used to determine whether a substance undergoes net reabsorption or secretion in the Nephron.  Let's consider the following example in which the urine and plasma values of an unknown substance X or given.  Using the information shown we can determine whether substance X undergoes net reabsorption or net secretion.  We can also determine what percentage of substance X is reabsorbed nor secreted.  In order to determine whether substance X undergoes net reabsorption or secretion, we first divide the urine concentration of X by the plasma concentration of substance X, which is 1 milligram per milliliter.  We then divide this number by the UDP ratio for inulin which in this case is 60.  This gives us an overall UDP ratio for substance X of 3.  Looking at our scale this indicates that substance X undergoes net secretion in the Nephron.  Furthermore we can see that 50% of substance X is secreted into the nephron since 3 is halfway between 1 and 5.  This same system can be used to determine the net absorption or secretion of any substance in which the urine and plasma values are known.\",\n",

The research says, yes, the brain is a glutton for  Put, so if you restrict the input channels, it kind of freaks out, sensory, deprivation tanks are basically this in a nutshell research from the Journal of nervous and mental disease. Found when people were placed in a sensory deprivation room. The brain couldn't tell if the thoughts and images it was creating were inside the head or outside the body. When deprived of input, the volunteers would experience visual hallucinations paranoia and a depressed mood, all this with less than 15 minutes of being inside that room. So if that's what  And with all the senses dulled, what about with? Just one Studies have shown blind. People experience a higher sound placement, ability and increased sense of touch. This has to do with the brain, literally reforming to take resources from the missing sense. A study in the Journal of Neuroscience used, fmri is to scan, the brains of people who were born deaf.

       " 'geO2L3fzF5g': \"Hi, I'm Bob Beckel at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus at Aurora just east of Denver and I'm here to report on a publication just released by the American Heart Association that deals with cardiovascular disease in patients with type 1 diabetes and I was a senior author on a multi authored paper that Sarah different a from the Boston Children's Hospital assume the role of the first author. The purpose of this manuscript really is to bring to light the Acted cardiovascular disease in patients with type 1 diabetes may not be the same entity that it is in type 2 diabetes and I should point out to the American Diabetes Association teamed up with the AHA on this document. So it's been reviewed by both organizations. But I think a couple of the key points that we want to bring forth on. This manuscript is is number what are the risk factors the same and they may not be other than duration of diabetes and perhaps hypertension and perhaps glucose control.  Roll that could be debated, you know the risk factors for efforts chronic cardiovascular disease and type 1 or quite a bit different. The lipids are very different many patients with type 1 diabetes have higher levels of HDL cholesterol, but yet they have a burden of cardiovascular disease particularly the after strike form. So why is that is the HDL not working correctly or in fact is is the high HDL in fact dysfunctional. In fact causing harm. I don't think we have an answer to that. So what are the other risks?  Sure would like that frascati cardiovascular system type 1 diabetes and this manuscript really reviews all the potential risk factors and brings up to date on that but really reveals the fact that we don't know a lot about the after Friday disease in patients with type 1 diabetes. Another area is the plaque is the plaque the saying is it so lipid late and not only is HDL hiring type 1 diabetic patients, but actually LDL cholesterol. So the same or lower triglycerides are almost never abnormal and less control is pitifully poorly.  Control, so I think we've got these issues related to the plaque itself. Maybe the plaque is less lipid Laden and I think one hypothesis is the plaque is more calcified more fibrotic and may actually be more stable in patients with type 1 is the disease the same another area is the acute coronary syndrome setting when the late George Johnson bar that I did an editorial actually in science translational science before George left us. Unfortunately prematurely we brought up the fact that  Acute coronary syndrome has never actually been studied in type one patient's everything that links diabetes. The cardiovascular disease is Type 2. But in fact what the group at the Jaws that has identified is that after a myocardial infarction or a mouse model of type 1 there is a antibody-mediated myocarditis developed. But when George and I wrote the editorial we couldn't find any evidence of the acute coronary syndrome is actually been studied. Well in patients with type 1 diabetes. In fact, is there an antibody me?  Deviated myocarditis that results in a greater likelihood of congestive heart failure and acute coronary syndrome and patients with type 1. We don't know and finally interventions in type 1 just have it in suit. What about Staten trials and type wind? When do we start a type one child with type 1 diabetes on a satin? What about antihypertensive therapy and cardiovascular disease outcomes in patients with type 1 and I think what the manuscript does is really reveal these absence areas of knowledge.  Type 1 diabetes and how it relates the coronary heart disease and peripheral vascular disease and stroke in patients with type 1 diabetes. In fact, I think what we've learned from this is that there's so many unanswered questions that when I was at a meeting at the niddk in the last year, ultimately I brought to the attention to niddk, but this error really needs more science. And in fact what's happened subsequent to that is that nhlbi and niddk are sponsoring a joint suppose IAM a work.  It's shop on coronary disease and type 1 diabetes that's going to take place this October. So we're excited about the opportunity to bring scientists from around the world together on a topic that's been poorly studied and I think this manuscript in circulation really highlights the need for additional science and medicine and this particular area.\",\n",

       " 'gGeLxjgUNG4': \"Imagine that day by day, your field of vision becomes slightly smaller narrowing or dimming until eventually you go completely blind. We tend to think of blindness as something you're born with, but in fact, with many diseases, like retinitis Pigmentosa and Usher's syndrome, blindness can start developing when you're a kid or even when you're an adult.  Both of these rare genetic diseases affect the retina the screen at the back of the eye, that detects light and helps us see. Now. Imagine if the, I could regenerate itself so that a blind person could see again to understand if that's possible. We need to grasp how the retina works and what it has to do with a multi-talented creature named the zebrafish. The human retina is made of different layers of cells with special neurons.  That live in the back of the eye called rod and Cone photoreceptors, photoreceptors convert the light coming into your eye into signals that the brain uses to generate Vision, people who have Usher's syndrome and retinitis Pigmentosa experienced, a steady loss of these photoreceptors until finally that screen in the I can no longer detect light nor broadcast signals to the brain, unlike most of your body's cells photoreceptors.  Don't divide and multiply we're born with all the photoreceptors will ever have, which is why babies have such big eyes for their faces and part of why they're so cute. But that isn't the case for all animals. Take the zebrafish a master regenerator. It can grow back its skin, bones heart and retina. After they've been damaged if photoreceptors in the zebrafish retina are removed or killed by toxins. They just regenerate  Rewire themselves to the brain to restore sight.  Scientists have been investigating this superpower because zebrafish retina are also structured of very much, like human retina scientists can even mimic the effects of disorders like Usher's syndrome or retinitis Pigmentosa on the zebrafish. I, this allows them to see how zebrafish go about repairing their retinas. So they might use similar tactics to fix human eyes one day, too.  So what's behind the zebrafish has super power, the main players are sets of long cells that stretch across the retina called Mueller. Glia when the photoreceptors are damaged these cells transform taking on a new character. They become less like molar cells and more like stem cells which can turn into any kind of cell. Then these long cells divide producing extras that will eventually grow into new photoreceptors travel to the back of the eye and rewire themselves.  To the brain. And now some researchers even think they've found the key to how this works. With the help of one of two chemicals, that create activity in the brain called glutamate and amino adipate. In mouse-sized. These make the molar glia divide and transform into photoreceptors, which then travel to the back of the retina. Like they're replenishing a failing army with new soldiers. But remember, none of this has happened in our retinas yet. So the question is, how do we trigger this?  Ation of the molar glia in the human eye. How can we fully control this process? How to photoreceptors rewire themselves into the retina? And is it even possible to trigger this in humans, or has this mechanism been lost over time in evolution until we tease apart? The origins of this ability retinal regeneration will remain a mysterious superpower of the common zebrafish.\",\n",
       " 'GNghXeGlTdI': \"Hello, I'm Tom Mason from the diabetes, Council.com researcher writer and I have type 2 diabetes. Today. I want to give you my top 10 best fiber foods for diabetes. After you watch the video. Today. I invite you to check out the description box for my new ebook. This is one of the most comprehensive diabetes meal planning books. You'll find anywhere it contains. Diabetes friendly meals and recipes recipes for different.  Goals such as eight hundred, two 1800 calories per day meal plans, diabetes meal, planning tips and tricks. And they're also tons of diabetes friendly recipes for everyone Diana Rodriguez lives. Not too far from me and she's an amazing journalist. I want to give her some props for helping me out with this video. Now, as a group Americans fall far short on the recommended amount of fiber people should eat every day. This deficiency can be especially  Harmful, when you're trying to manage diabetes and possibly lose weight. When you have diabetes, increasing your daily. Fiber intake has many benefits, including improving your heart health, and helping to maintain blood sugar control. According to a research review, published in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine a diet. That's high in fiber, may even help lower your A1C test results, which measures your average blood sugar control over 2 to 3 months.  According to Meredith, no end, who is a registered dietitian with the diabetes self-management program, at the Methodist Charlton, Medical Center in Dallas quote. The average amount of fiber consumed in the United States is only 10 to 20 grams per day. Now, The Institute of medicine recommends daily, fiber totals based on your age and gender men under 50 years old. Should get about 38 grams per day men over 50,  You get, 30 grams per day, women under 50, should get 25 grams per day and women over 50 should get 21 grams per day. The American Diabetes Association recommends, a goal of 25 to 30 grams of fiber per day dietitians. Recommend eating more foods with high fiber to achieve these daily goals, but fiber supplements could also be an option. Now, before we go on, I do want  want to stress that we need to know why we need fiber. There are many reasons for including fiber in your daily diet, but I don't expect you just to eat fiber because I say so for starters fiber helps slow the rise in blood sugar that can occur after a meal. When we take in food during the meal, our blood sugar is going to go up fiber helps slow that rise and helps us to adjust our blood sugar as a night or day goes on Fiverr also.  Actually, decrease cholesterol and provides bulk in the diet that helps naturally decrease hunger. I call this staying Fuller longer and that is something that is very important, that also makes it a good addition for people on a heart-healthy diet, your toward maintaining a healthy weight. Now the wind points out that you can experience greater advantages with even more daily fiber and says that you might aim for 44 to 50 grams a day for the best blood sugar control benefits.  Now this might seem like an impossibly high goal. If your fiber consumption is like that of the average American, but with baby steps and good planning. I think you can get there. So let's get into my top 10 fiber foods for diabetes in no particular order will begin with lentils. Now lentils are colorful legumes packed with both fiber and protein, a good source of plant protein. As a matter of fact about 40% of the total carbs and lentils is fiber leading to a  Lower blood sugar response, lentils boasts, more than 15 grams of fiber per serving, plus nearly 18 grams of protein, according to the US, Department of Agriculture. Are you in a hurry up for quick, cooking, red, lentils, and use them in a soup or salad?  Beans. Now, the trick for reaping the most benefit from Beans is to pick a rainbow of them. Don't just stick with one, but a cup of cooked red. Kidney beans, has about 13 grams of fiber, a cup of black beans, 15 grams, white beans, more than 18 grams, in addition to their fiber content, beans, as well as lentils have a starch that's resistant to digestion, meaning it doesn't get into the bloodstream quickly and affect blood sugar.  Plus this starch is good news for gut bacteria. When bacteria, make a meal of resistant starch, some fatty acids are formed. Now these beneficial fatty acids, promote better use of insulin and healthier colon to get more beans in your diet. Tried tossing them with your favorite salad in the soup or entree.  Artichokes. Now, this is probably the first time I've ever mentioned artichokes in any of my videos and I've done a lot of videos for the diabetes Council.com, but artichokes are really amazing. They're tender flavorful and packed with fiber, one medium sized. Artichoke has more than 10 grams of fiber. They're also a great source of blood pressure, lowering potassium and magnesium as well as vitamin C and folate. You might want to remove  Move the bottom leaves and cut off the tips of the top. Third of that artichoke and remove the stem. Trim the Thorns for those top leaves and steam them for about 25 minutes. Over boiling water. Now once cooled peel off the succulent leaves, dip them in olive oil or something like that, and they are dee-licious.  Popcorn. Now, I've talked about the benefits of popcorn before and rather than reaching for a bag of chips. When you want that salty snack, pop some fresh popcorn, instead. You just need to go light on the butter and salt, this isn't movie theater popcorn or you can try to drizzle it with a little bit of olive oil. Put on some dry herbs by dash of hot sauce. That's not bad either. You can have 3 cups of air-popped popcorn contains three grams of fiber. Now popcorn is cholesterol free and has almost no fat.  And very few calories. It's also a low GI and GL food, meaning that it's slowly digested and has a gradual impact on blood sugar levels avocados. Now. I know this is the first time I've ever talked about avocados, but, you know, I'm just not a huge fan, but I do like them as a dip, their good, mashed up into a dip or used as a spread instead of mayo avocados. Have a good source of both fiber and heart-healthy Omega-3  Three fatty acids. Now, one cup of pureed avocado has more than 13 grams of fiber, but it also has 368 calories and 34 grams of fat. So remember a little will go a long way but one tablespoon of mashed avocado for a tablespoon of butter replacing those, when baking opt for a sliced avocado and place of cheese, maybe on your favorite sandwich. You just get a lot of fiber with avocados.  Peace. Now. I'm a huge fan of the P. These little starchy vegetables are just packed with vitamins. A c and k, and make great substitutes for Rice, shouldn't eat a lot of rice as a, those with diabetes. So this is a great substitute for some split peas, are especially good choice. One cup contains 16 grams of fiber. Now, that's from the Mayo, Clinic toss, peas into your favorite salad, or a pasta dish for added.  Cranston fiber enjoy them on their own. Sprinkle a little fresh mint or partially they're very, very good. Broccoli. Now cup of chopped raw. Broccoli offers two point, four grams of fiber and nearly the same amount of protein. Plus this cruciferous green. Veggie is very rich in vitamin C k-- and folate and the mineral potassium. Broccoli is generally steamed with the florets toss them with some garlicky. Olive oil or mix them into some kind of pasta.  Or or casserole, added raw or crunchy into your favorite green salad. Broccoli is a very good source of fiber but also protein, berries. Berries, berries. Now, if you've seen any of my videos about what we should eat as those with diabetes, I am a big proponent of fresh fruit, and one of those fresh fruits is berries, bite-size. Sweet. They're loaded with fiber antioxidants and other nutrients. Raspberries strawberries.  Blackberries blueberries, they're all good and they have about 7 grams of fiber per cup. I mean, these little berries are loaded with health boosting compounds, including those that help prevent certain types of cancer and improve the health of the heart for a sweet dessert. Just enjoy some berries. Top of the few dark chocolate shavings. Yes, as a person with diabetes. You can have a dark chocolate. We're going to do a video on that. Sick picks a green red.  Or brown all pairs offer. The same health benefits. A large pair contains 7 grams of fiber along with vitamin C and potassium. Now, that is leaving the skin on obviously, you know, you can dribble drizzle pairs with a little balsamic vinegar and then Grill. It, that's pretty tall, young good. You can really have pairs. Anyway, eat them, eat them raw, eat them whole. You can put slices on some of your salads at the start of your meal.  There are great snack to throw in your purse or in your bag of some sort, your your tote to take along with you as a snack pairs, are a good source of fiber. Finally, try barley or oatmeal. Now, I prefer oatmeal myself, but I had become quite a barley fan as of late. Both of these whole grains are good sources of fiber. Try barley in place of rice or pasta in your favorite dishes and replace breadcrumbs with oatmeal and meatloaf more for coating. Baked chicken or fish both contain the  The fiber beta glucan, which improves insulin action, lowers blood sugar, and helps sweep cholesterol from the digestive tract. One cup of cooked, barley contains six grams of fiber, one cup of cooked. Oatmeal contains about 4 grams. Let me tell you something, oatmeal with a little milk. Sucralose and some berries, or cinnamon and apples. Hmm, best breakfast. You'll have all day long. Well, there you have it.  My top tent fiber foods for those with diabetes.

       " 'gQBkfKUxh_E': \"Hello, I'm Tom Mason of the diabetes, Council.com researcher writer and I have type 2 diabetes. I want to emphasize that my perspective is coming from one with type 2 and not type 1 diabetes. Our channel is primarily for those with type 2 diabetes and prediabetes.  Today, I want to answer the question. Will I lose my feet because of prediabetes?  After you watch the video today, I invite you to check out the description box for my new ebook. This is one of the most comprehensive diabetes meal planning books. You'll find anywhere it contains. Diabetes friendly meals and recipes recipes for different goals. Such as eight hundred, two 1800 calories per day meal plans, diabetes meal, planning tips and tricks. There are also tons of diabetes friendly recipes for everyone.  Now, let me State up front that the chances of someone with pre-diabetes losing a foot to amputation because of the disease is highly unlikely. I've found no cases in my research, but why would someone asked this question in the first place? Well, diabetes can lead to complications in which amputation may be necessary. Let me explain with the help of the American College of foot and ankle surgeons people with  BT's are more susceptible to foot problems often because of to complications of the disease nerve damage. I'll called diabetic neuropathy or poor circulation. Peripheral neuropathy causes a loss of feeling in the feet, reducing the ability to feel pain or injury poor circulation. Diminishes, the body's ability to heal making it difficult to resist infection and heal injuries or  Means for a person with diabetes, these complications can be deadly combination. When a person with diabetes has neuropathy. They often can't tell if their shoes are causing pressure and producing corns, calluses Cuts or blisters. These minor foot injuries can develop into ulcers, which is a break or hole in the skin. With poor circulation. The ulcers can become infected and then may not heal properly. Now, this is a  Complication associated with diabetes and can lead to a chronic foot ulcer, which is the leading cause of amputation, amputation is considered when healing potential is poor or a serious infection becomes widespread and could threaten the patient's life. Now, let me reiterate, this is talking about diabetes, not pre-diabetes. However, we have discussed a pre diabetes can lead to type 2, so I think it's important.  That we talk about these now to prevent these complications. It's vital to take preventative measures to care for your feet, including wearing proper shoes, daily foot inspections and regular exams, by your healthcare provider or even a podiatrist. Even the smallest foot problem can turn into serious complications. It's important to seek treatment early for any issues. Especially minor Cuts, blisters corns and calluses.  Now, when complications arise, the loss of life and limb are real concerns for those with diabetes who have a serious infection, Physicians and patients must work together to consider the best options to treat that infection prevent limb loss and to get the patient as well as possible.  Now amputation is a complicated and it's something that both patients and Physicians work hard to avoid. If possible. It is estimated that nearly 85% of amputations are preventable, with education and early intervention amputation. Should not always be seen as a failure of treatment, but sometimes a faster more reliable means of Rehabilitation in order to return to activities of daily living.  The surgery may be the best way to control a severe infection that could require a more traumatic amputation in the future or that could. Otherwise prove fatal for the patient after undergoing, an amputation patients often experience improve General Health because the severe infection has been resolved. Now, amputations not always mean loss of an entire foot or leg surgical intervention is performed at many levels.  Reading partial toe, amputations partial foot amputations or below the knee, amputations a foot and ankle surgeon will make a thorough assessment and determine the best method of getting the patient on the road to recovery. Now, as stated earlier, the likelihood of one with pre-diabetes losing, a foot is extremely unlikely. However, those with type 2 are at a higher risk. So let's watch those feet. Let me give you a quick.  Session and foot care and this really should become a daily routine for you. Inspect your feet. Check your feet and Toes inspecting, the tops sides. Souls heels in the area between your toes. If you're physically unable to inspect your own feet, use a mirror or ask someone to help contact your doctor immediately. If you discover any sores, redness, Cuts, blisters or bruises.  Wash your feet every day in warm water, with mild soap, hot water and harsh soaps can damage your skin. Check the water temperature with your fingers or elbow before putting your feet. In your diabetes, may make it difficult to sense. Water temperature with your feet. Be sure to dry your feet. Pat them dry and make sure they're dried. Well infections tend to develop in moist areas. So make sure  You draw the area between your toes very well and moisturize your feet. If the skin on your feet feels rough or dry use lotions or Oils, but do not use them between your toes. This is a very important thing. We're talking about here, very important stuff. Make sure you take care of those feet.  Don't forget to get my new e-book and please subscribe to our channel for many more videos like this one in the future. Thank you so much for watching.

       " 'Grw7zvY9gY8': \"So what is peripheral vascular disease? Well, first of all, vascular disease, refers to any problem with a vasculature of the body, those would be the arteries. And veins peripheral is to distinguish it from two other, vascular beds in the body. The main three vascular beds in the body, would be the cerebral, or vascular bed of the brain, the coronary vascular bed, which feeds the heart, and then the vascular bed, which feeds everything else, the rest of the body. So,  Vascular disease is really talking about the disease, which affects the vasculature of the rest of the Body. For the most part are lower extremities are legs. It can be caused by a lot of the same things that cause this cerebrovascular disease or the corner, vascular disease, that would be the build-up of cholesterol plaque within those arteries. For the most part. They have a lot of the same risk factors as the cerebral in corner. Vascular disease. Does that would be smoking. Lack of exercise, increase blood pressure and cholesterol for peripheral vascular disease. However, smoking  Plays a large Factor. So how do you know if you have peripheral vascular disease, often times? You can note that in one of two ways, one would be lower extremity, cramping or pain, which we call claudication with walking. Another way, maybe to see that the signs of decreased blood flow to the legs or feet. That would be cold or cool feet or hair loss on the lower extremities or a change in color of the feet or toes. The most common symptom would be claudication, which is a leg cramping during  Walking, the best thing to do would be to see your doctor. Your doctor can order a pretty simple test, which we call a lower extremity, vascular study, or peripheral artery study the test starts off with something called an ankle brachial index which is just a simple measure of the blood pressure difference between the arms or upper extremity and the legs. It can be done with a simple 15-minute in-office procedure. It's pretty painless and will tell the doctor right away if there's any problems with the vasculature in your legs. So how do we treat peripheral artery disease?  It would be going back to the basic lifestyle, modifications stopping smoking, reducing your blood pressure and treating high cholesterol. Another very important way. We treat peripheral artery disease, would be to increase the amount of exercise you do. And that's the basic things. You need to know about peripheral artery disease.\",\n",

       " 'H-qREcJqUhY': \"That's what we're talking about here. So, per one liter of  Plasma, and these are the units that we have to think about to answer. This question is what are the odds moles per liter plasma. So let's go through this and I'm going to give you some lab values and we'll see how based on just a few lab values and really, just four of the most representative solutes or most important solutes, we can get a pretty close guesstimate of the osmolarity. So you don't actually need to know every single osmel that's in your plasma. You can figure it out based on for the most important ones. So,  Let's go with the first one, sodium.  Sodium. And let's say, the lab tells you well your sodium value and I'm going to write the labs in kind of this gray color. Somehow that reminds me of the lab. Let's say, they say the sodium values, 140 milkweed plants per liter. So how do you take that and make it into Oz moles per liter? Well, our denominators already? Okay, but immediately you can say, okay. Well, 140 millimoles per liter is what that equals and, you know, that because sodium is a  No, valence only got one charge monovalent ion. So it's mono valent. Then that means that the equivalence equal the moles. And now that you're in moles, you can actually go across to osmoles. You can say 140 osmoles or milliosmoles per liter and you know that because once sodium is in water, it acts the same way that you would expect it to act. It doesn't split up or anything like that because it's one particle. So  Acts as a single particle.  One particle. So if it's one particle, it's going to, it's going to have 140 million homes per liter and we've effectively gotten 1/4 of this problem, done. Because all we need to do is take the four different solutes that we've identified and add them up together. So we figured out sodium. And now, let's move on to the anion and the trick to the anion is just thinking of it as sodium. It's almost the same as sodium, but just the reverse. So we know that it's going to be  140 we're going to use 140 is the number here because our assumption, our assumption is that sodium is a positive charge and for every one positive charge, you need one negative charge. So we're going to assume that all the negative charges are coming from these anions. And these would be things like we said things like chloride or bicarb, something like that. So again, we don't actually get these numbers or even need these numbers. We simply take that.  80 and we multiply by 2 and assume that the other half is going to be some anion. Now, we actually have to convert units, still, we have to get over to Millions per liter. And so we know that the anion is going to be mono valent and that gets us to mmol and we use the same logic as above. We just okay, if that was mmol and it's still one particle, meaning it's not splitting up when it hits water.  Going in two different directions. In a sense, having twice the effect.  We're going to end up with 140 million atoms per liter just as before. So this is our second part done. Right? So two parts are done, figured out the sodium and we figured out the anion. Now, let's go over to glucose. So let's figure out how to get glucose units from what the lab gives us, which I'll tell you, in just a second into something more usable. So how do we actually get over to  Something usable me actually help us switch over.  There we go. Make some space on our canvas. So let's say we have our glucose here.  And the lab calls us and says, hey, we just got your lab result. It was 90 milligrams per deciliter. Especially very, very common lab value, or common range for a glucose lab value.  One thing we have to do right away. It's figure out how to get from mg to moles. And you know, that this is what glucose looks like. This is the formula for it. So to get the overall weight, the atomic weight, you could say, well, let's take 6, because that's how many carbons we have times the weight of carbon which is 12 plus 12. That's we have here times the weight of hydrogen which is 1 plus 6 times the weight of oxygen.  And that's going to equal. This is 72. This is 12 and this is 96 and add them all up together and we get 180. So we have 180 atomic mass units per glucose molecule, which means if you think back, which means that one mole of glucose 1, mole of glucose equals 180.  Yes, and since these are way, way bigger than I mean, this is G and we're talking about MG over here. So I'm going to just switch it down by 1000. So one mmol of glucose equals.  Eight or 180 milligrams. All I did was divide by 1000. So now I can take this unit, actually use use our conversions. I could say. Well, let's multiply that by 100, and it's a 1, millimolar. Rather 1, millimolar /, 180 milligrams. I'll cancel the mg out. And I also have to get from DL 2 liters, right? So I've got to go 10 DL.  Equals 1 L and that'll cancel my DL out. So I'm left with and this 10 will get rid of that zero. So I'm left with 90 divided by 18 which is five millimoles per liter and just as above I know that the glucose will behave as one particle in water and solution. So it's going to be 5 oz moles or milliosmoles actually five milliosmoles.  Per liter, and that's the right units, right? So I figured out another part of my formula and I'll show you the actual formula at the end of this, but I wanted to work through it piece by piece. So we've done glucose now and we're ready for our last bit. So let's do our last one which is going to be urea. So specifically the lab is not going to call us about Yuri. It's going to call us about blood urea nitrogen.  And actually, it matters what this means. So what that exactly means is that they're measuring the nitrogen component of urea, and so they'll call you and say, well, you know, we measured it and the value came to 14 milligrams per deciliter, something like that. So let's say that's the amount of urea. We find in our little tube of plasma. How do we convert that to moles per liter like we did before? Well, again it  It'll be helpful. If I draw out a molecule of urea. So we have something like this a couple nitrogen's. This is what eurion looks like. It's a pretty small molecule couple nitrogen's carbon and oxygen and these nitrogen's haven't tonic mass unit of 14 apiece. That's 14 and this is 14 over here as well. So what it actually measures the lab actually measures is just this part. It's just measuring the two.  It's not measuring the weight of the entire molecule. So all it's going to give you is the weight of the nitrogen's that are in the molecule. So what that means is that we say, okay. Well that tells us that one, one molecule.  One molecule of urea is going to be 28 atomic mass units of. I'm going to put it in quotes urea nitrogen.  Because that's the part of urea that we're measuring and that means that one mole of urea is going to be 28 grams of urea nitrogen.  And because again, this is much much more than what we actually have. Let me divide by 1000. So 1 millimolar equals 28 mg of urea nitrogen, so that's how we figure out.  The conversion and I do the exact same thing as above. I said, okay. Well, let's times let's say, I want to get rid of the mg. Right? So 1 millimolar divided by twenty eight milligrams, and that'll get rid of my mg. And I'll take, let's say 10 DL / 1 liter and that'll help me get rid of my DL. And so, then I'm left with 14 over 28, which is point 5.  And then x 10 sets, 55 millimoles per liter and as I've done a couple times now and we know that it's the urea nitrogen or the URI is going to act and behave like one molecule or one particle when it's in water. It's not going to split up or anything like that. So that means that it's going to basically be 5 Milli azam's per liter.  And so I figured out the last part of my equation.  So, going back to the top.  We have sodium and this turned out to be a total of 140.  140 million Awesomes.  Per liter and then for our anion, we had 140 million atoms per liter. And then for our glucose, we had 5 Milli azam's per liter.  And for our urea we had 5 million atoms per liter. So adding it all up. Our total comes to 140 times 2 plus 10. So we get. If I do my math correctly. I think that's 290 million autism's per liter. That's the answer to our osmolarity.\",\n",
       " 'h0zD1gj0pXk': \"Coca-Cola.  Obesity is part of the human condition. And there are evolutionary reasons why obesity has been selected for in individual populations? Because people who store energy are more likely to be able to survive periods of famine. So there is a selection process that goes on all the time, but none of those things explain how in 30 years we have gone from being  Out, if you will, to basically being unbelievably sick.  That's what an epidemic or pandemic in this case. Looks like that's what plague.  Influenza looked like and the question is, what would be the exposure that could account for this? And if it was just gluttons and sloths. How do you explain the obese? Six-month-old? We have an epidemic of obesity six-month-olds in this country. They don't diet and exercise. You're going to call them a bunch of gluttons and sloths. This goes Way Beyond.  The question of personal responsibility we have felt like it's individuals responsibility to keep their energy balance to eat the right amount and stay the right weight, but when something goes wrong like the majority of the population becoming overweight, we have to question that model and we have to look at the forces outside of ourselves. These huge societal and environmental forces.  That are shaping obesity. The reason we're in this epidemic.  Can be summed up with one statement. One.  Idea, that has become so pervasive that has become sacrosanct that it has become Dogma.  And that statement is a calorie is a calorie. It's the first thing dietitians, learn and dietary school. If you eat more than you burn, you will gain weight. If you eat less than you burn. You will lose weight.  And it doesn't matter if those calories come from carrots or cheesecake. The bottom line is a calorie is a calorie. You eat too much. You exercise too little, and that's the Mantra and guess what? It doesn't work.  And the reason it doesn't work is because a calorie is not a calorie.  The only Dogma is there is none. Choose your favorite hypothesis. There's so many. Well, you know, what is it in our environment? Is it just the excess of food? Is it the high fructose corn syrup? Is it the antibiotics were taking the estrogens, different hormones and hormone mimickers. Is it the intrauterine environment? All of these factors play a role? So it is not.  Just one thing. I mean, if there's one big thing, it's of course. It is our food environment.  Fast foods, fast preparing fast eating and fast causing disease to, and we in our to parent. Working to our commuting to job life.  Do not have time for food. This is the biggest issue that we currently face. It is the reason that the industrial Global diet has taken over the world is because with all of our labor saving devices with the cars and the computers and lawn mowers that you sit on instead of push, etc. Etc. All of those things have actually reduced our time not created it.  So, this is a function of the changes that we have made, in our society, ostensibly for our benefit. The question is, are they? Well, there's been a number of changes in the last 30 years and how we interact with food with our food supply. There's over 24,000 different foods that enter the marketplace every year. And there's the issue of sleep patterning stress how we feed our animals, the  Nutrients in the soil. There's a number of different issues at play. All of these Converge on. I think adding to something to the Obesity epidemic, the Western diet, our diet that we prize and Export all over the globe, has now become the industrial Global diet.  Because it's cheap. It's  portable.  It has no depreciation witnessed the 10 year old Twinkie.  And it was designed to taste really good to keep people eating. This is now.  Everywhere, this is the exposure. This is what, what has changed. I think we have had a perfect storm. We have had the Confluence of this change food environment, the restricted activity like know PE in schools and chemicals, that we're not quite sure what we're being exposed to.  And they're working together.  All right. Is that look good? But honey, what all these calories do to my waistline? Relax? Its diet Delight. There was a big war.  In the food field, back in the 60s and 70s, and the war was fat or sugar. And so, we were remanded as a country to reduce our consumption of fat from 40 percent to 30 percent. Well, guess what we did it. We are there, but the total consumption of calories and specifically carbohydrate and especially sugar.  Has gone through the roof.  So, it was that.  Directive. That Edict of the late 1970s that started the Obesity and metabolic syndrome ball rolling. It is almost impossible to buy those packaged foods without getting a lot of extra sugars that are just going to be toxic for your metabolism. I'm suspicious of anything that says low-fat or Diet because you know, that that means that they've had to compensate with a lot of  He's added sugars. A perfect example. Snack Wells. So, what's a snack? Well, two grams of fat down 13 grams of carbohydrate increased, four of which are sugar.  No fewer calories, same number of calories. And if that's not the problem and sugar is you can see where we're going here. There's also the change in this food supply so that those highly palatable foods are more easily accessible. So we can reach for that comfort food at any street corner at any time during the day and have a few extra calories.  when we talk about,  The diseases of obesity we are talking about type 2 diabetes, hypertension lipid problems. So, blood fats. If you will part disease, those are sort of the big four if you will that constitute what we classically called the metabolic syndrome. However, we now know that there are several other diseases that fall within this scope as well for instance, non-alcoholic fatty.  He liver disease, which now affects one. Third of all Americans.  Polycystic ovarian syndrome, which affects 10 percent of all women cancer, and also dementia.  Now, here's the key. Everyone thinks that those Downstream diseases are because of the Obesity.  And that could not be further from the truth, the Obesity travels with those diseases, but the Obesity is a marker for those diseases, twenty percent of obese. People have a completely normal cellular metabolism, and they will live to a normal age.  40% of thin people, normal weight people have those same, chronic metabolic diseases and we'll die of them. Nobody dies of the Obesity per se. They died of the diseases that come from the metabolic dysfunction. So when you do the math,  That accounts for 60% of America.  We are not talking about a minority. We are talking about the majority. So when you add up the medical costs, for those eight diseases, that is 75 percent of healthcare expenditures. Not just ours, not just America, but all over the world so much. So that in September of 2011, the United Nations Secretary General announced that  Non-communicable disease. That is chronic metabolic disease, type 2, diabetes heart disease hypertension cancer dementia. Now posed, a bigger threat to the developing world, not the developed world, the developing world, then did acute infectious disease, and that includes HIV.  This is enormous. This is mind-boggling. This is absolutely staggering that developing countries. Have a bigger problem with obesity and diabetes than they do with cholera.  And other infections.  When you think about that, that really has to stop and give you pause.  Something is going on.\",\n",

This is the beginning of our future. A really is I this is the beginning of like a whole new life. I feel like  Okay, this is week, one of the video, diary last week. I had an endoscopy done. So this week I got the letter basically saying all is well. I'm good. I'm all right, for the surgery. I'm just gonna go through a couple quick questions for you if you still want, dr. Shope, as your surgeon. Oh, yeah, sure. Okay. So make sure he's doing your surgery and  After I've lost a significant amount of weight with the surgery, I expect my life to get easier in certain areas when it comes to school. Like I said, Mobility climbing steps or sitting in smaller desks have an easier time.  Shopping for clothes.  We're going to just get fired. Really. I didn't really consider bariatric surgery for myself until my mom was considering it for herself. And that was kind of what sealed the deal for me. We about what from Nigeria, right in West Africa. And the notion that we have in Africa is the big guy. You are the more money you have to spend. So when we came here, I lie with just, you know, grew up.  It was something as I'm going up to like, 50 pounds. Yeah, they came here and then you want to feed your children. What you missed as a child. You don't want them to miss. It it whatever you want to eat, you know? Okay, so I decided I wanted McDonald's for breakfast. Hi. Can I have one bacon egg and cheese, McGriddle meal large, hot caramel mocha, I think a lot about college will be different from high school. I want to be a lot more social in college. I actually want to  Join a lot more clubs. And now I have this kind of surgery thrown in there. The after affects the aftermath of that.  Good morning. It's April 19th. It's the day of surgery. I'm really happy. I'm really excited. Mom. Are you excited? I'm having vertical sleeve gastrectomy today and I decided to do this because I know I'm, like, 230 pounds overweight. I thought a lot about the life changes, the positive Life Changes that's going to come from this and really, really excited for them. I'm happy. I'm chill.  The same time. I don't know. I'm like mellow but excited, it's weird. I don't know, but I'm not nervous.  Well, if I was going to write it from one to ten, ten being like the worst pain I've ever felt. It was probably maybe around 27, nausea pain in my up my abdominal area I threw up at least twice while I get full very quickly. I also you know, I get hungry quicker than I expected. So, a few weeks ago, I noticed on my weight went up. There's no way I could have eaten enough food to maintain my weight. I was really sad. Like I didn't tell my mom until like four days after I win my  Of look through some like chats and things of people who had bariatric surgery around three or four weeks, their weight will stall, or go up even and it's not necessarily uncommon initially, my intentions were to go to college, but due to like Financial issues. I decided that the best thing was for me to defer for a year. So I'm working 40 hours a week.  So I'm going to be saving at least half of my income for school. So I just finished with my first day of my first job ever, which was at Checkers. They really just had me on the grill, like flipping patties. I was on my feet the whole time. As expected. I did definitely get hot at times my feet kind of hurt, but it was my first day. So me and my sister decided that we were going to start walking to Safeway the first time we did it.  Hey what such a mess. We were so weak. But we stuck doing cuz cuz we're Champions. What are we Champions know? What's the are we Champion? I'm so serious. You're gonna kick us out of this. Goddamn Community. Overall. I just felt like Checkers wasn't the job from me. I just every but you're so uncomfortable. I was also slow because of my lethargy from being so hot all the time. I interviewed at Safeway and I  Tired. Same day is cold because it's a grocery store. It's much more comfortable for me. I had my surgery about four and a half months ago by bariatric standards. My progress, isn't that good? But I mean, by my own personal standards 50 pounds in four and a half months is great. What I decided to do was meal prepping. I made sure that everything, I, every like Bowl I made had at least 30 grams of protein in it.  So I went shopping recently and I was trying on the same sizes that I was wearing pre-op. I was noticing that they were too big on me and then I tried on things that were 14 16 and they fit I said, what you're talking about. I was just so excited and in the dressing room, they were playing music. I was dancing along, I was so happy. I don't think I like I was I was looking to the videos, I actually do.  I think I saw a single video of a teenager. I feel like when you're younger, you have a bit less control in your life. So you have to be able to adapt to all the changes that are coming your way regardless of whether you asked for them. So the first few months I was really in this mindset of like I don't have to do as much because the surgery like the restrictive space in my stomach is enough to just to just sort of on its own. Help me lose a lot of weight.  Without me having to put in much effort. And I think that is true for a lot of bariatric patients, but it really wasn't for me. And I think it helped me grow as a person for me. It wasn't perfect. It wasn't super, super ideal, but I wasn't just going to sit back and then be upset about it. Just let it happen. I'm not that type of person.  So click update for you guys. I've been super, super dedicated to me and my mom's business. I've  I'm putting in a ton of time and effort. I've also been applying to colleges and applying a scholarships right now. I weigh around, 310 bringing my total weight loss 276 pounds in 8 months. It is beautiful. How life can change like that. So unexpectedly. It's just been absolutely amazing.\",\n",
       " 'HcT4K5KkTDE': \"Over the last two decades, there's been increasing evidence, supporting an important contribution from food. Derived, Advanced glycation. End-products AG. He's also known as glycotoxins to increased oxidative stress and inflammation processes. That play a major role in the conservation of chronic diseases including potentially polycystic ovary syndrome. Women with pecan, stand to have nearly twice the circulating a GE levels in their blood stream. Polycystic. Ovary syndrome may be the most common hormonal abnormalities among young women in the United States, common cause of infertility, menstrual dysfunction in excess facial and body hair. Now, the prevalence of obesity is also higher in women with PCOS. And so since the highest a GE levels are found in broiled grilled fried roasted foods of mostly animal origin. Is it possible that this causal chain starts with the bad diet, like lots of fried chicken, which leads to obesity which then in turn.  Turn leads to Picasso. What we eat, maybe he's only indirectly related to because through weight gain. No? Because the same link between High AG levels and peacocks was found in lean women as well as chronic inflammation. Increased oxidative stress been incriminating the disease process of because of the role of a ge's is pro-inflammatory. Pro-oxidant mediators. May indeed, be linked with a metabolic and reproductive abnormalities of the syndrome and further the build-up of a GE inside policy.  It's ovaries themselves. Suggest a potential role of age. He's contributing to the disease process itself Beyond, just some of the consequences.  Rage is highly expressed in ovarian tissues. In other words, the receptor. That's the are in Rage. The receptor in the body for these Advanced glycation end products is concentrated for some reason in the ovary. So ovaries may be particularly sensitive to their effects. So AG, he's might indeed be contributing to the cause of polycystic ovary syndrome in infertility. So, should we just cut down on meat cheese and eggs?  Or we can always come up with a GE absorption blocking drugs.  We know AG's have been implicated in the development of many chronic diseases, specifically food. Derived, a cheese, play an important role died as a major source of these pro-inflammatory AG's indeed cutting down on these dietary. Glycotoxins reduces the inflammatory response, but stewed chicken just doesn't taste as good as Fried Chicken. So therefore you can have your KFC and eat it too. Just take this drug with it every time you eat to cut down in the absorption of these toxins.  And it works, it actually lowers a GE blood levels this oral absorbent drug. AST, 120 is just a preparation of activated charcoal. That's what you like, give her a drug overdoses. And when people are poisoned, I'm I'm sure if you, if you took some ipecac with your KFC, your levels would go down, too.  You know, there's another way you can reduce your absorption by reducing your intake in the first place, simple safe feasible. The first thing you do is stop smoking, the glycotoxins and cigarettes from smoke, May contribute to the increase in heart disease and cancer among smokers. Then you can decrease your intake of high, a GE Foods while increasing your intake of foods that may help pull a G's out of your system. Like brown rice and mushrooms and we can eat foods high in antioxidants, like berries, herbs, and spices.  Dietary ege intake can be decreased even just by simply changing the method of cooking from the high temperature dry cooking methods to low heat higher humidity. In other words, moving away from broiling searing frying to more stewing steaming and boiling. But what we eat, maybe more important than how we cook it. For example, boiled, chicken has less than half, the glycotoxins of roasted chicken, but even deep fried potatoes.  Has less then boiled meat. We can also eat Foods raw, which doesn't work as well for blood pudding, but we can't use raw nuts. And nut Butters, which may have 30 times less glycotoxins than roasted and we can stay from stay away from high EG processed foods, such as puffed shredded and flaked breakfast cereal. Why does it matter because study after study has shown the switching someone to a low, a GE diet can lower.  Our the inflammation within their bodies. Even just a single high, a GE meal can profoundly impaired or artery function within just two hours of consumption fried or broiled chicken breast and veggies compared to steamed or boiled chicken vet, breast, and veggies, the same ingredients, just different cooking methods. Now, you'll notice that even the steamed or boiled chicken meal, still impaired arterial function. So you could certainly choose,  To eat, even healthier. But significantly better than the fried or broiled. Ironically the amount of a ge's administered during this High a GE intervention. This profoundly impaired, your artery function. Amount of a GES was similar to the average estimated daily intake by the general population, standard American diet. That's why you can decrease inflammation and people putting them on a low, a GE diet. But an increase in inflammation was less apparent when people switch from their regular diet to  A high AG died because they're already eating a high, a GE diet. So many of these glycotoxins in their regular diet. Do we have evidence? Reducing agen? Take actually helps with polycystic ovaries. Yes, within just two months, Baseline, diet, switch to a high, a GED to a low AG died and you see parallel changes in insulin sensitivity, oxidative stress hormonal status with the take-home being that those with P. Cos may want to try a little  Low, a GE diet, which in the study meant restricting meat to once a week, that's only boiled poach, stood, or steamed, and cutting out, fast food-type foods and soda. What about instead of steamed chicken? We eat, no meat at all, rather than measuring blood levels, which vary with each meal. Like, if we just ate some roasted nuts or something. We can measure the level of glycotoxins stuck in your body tissues over.  A time instead with a fancy Gizmo, that measures the amount of light, your skin gives off because AG he's are fluorescent. And so, no, surprise. This turns out to be a strong predictor of overall mortality. So, the lower the better, and the one factor consistently associated with reduced skin fluorescence. This reduced AG, he's coming out of your body.  Was a vegetarian diet which suggests that eating more plant-based, May reduce exposure to these preformed dietary. EG. He's potentially reducing tissue AG, he's as well as chronic disease risk.\",\n",
       " 'Hd4kvlF1uCA': \"Any funding for a woman's Journal. They were all women that wanted this. So they then sent out a request to everybody and the surgeons. I got I was in the American Academy of surgery in terms of just being somebody who gets their Journal. So I got the journal. I got a request for money from them from the American College of OB-GYN doctors. I got a request through that for money. So I sent them $300 or something like  that and all the other women in the United States did too and they started this journal and they went from that journal to. Now there's a conference every year all its in Europe to gender specific medicine conference. So they've now expanded to people who do research that is gender specific. So they went to the men that dominated the system they ask for the money for a journal and they were told no. So they just created their own playground, right? They just they just got they got donations and we got a new Journal. That's awesome. I get lots.  Articles every month that they're like, women asking to be on the panel that Darryl Isis, subcommittee meeting on contraception last month, right? I mean, they weren't invited. They weren't bad because they don't know anything about contraception. That's right. Thank you possibly understand. Yeah, there were no doctor. No. The conversation from the doctors are a lot of religious people. Yeah. That's right. Okay. So today we're going to talk about this article. Little specific article in specific medicine about hypo androgynous.  ISM. And that's a big mouthful of words. That actually is an older term for a term that that Kathy is originated in her work and it will be coming out and discussed in her forthcoming book called her own testosterone, deprivation syndrome. And basically, that is an inevitable syndrome for both women and men. But it is something that happens in women. After 40 where we get to little, we are making two little to stas thrown from are over.  Is to actually feel good and be healthy. So we hit a wall, everybody's walls a little different, but we all will hit that wall. The age that we get. It is a little different, your ovaries are removed. That's it. You hit that wall immediately. No matter what age you are, right. So we need to have testosterone just like men, do. And interestingly enough, women have three times as much testosterone in their bodies when they're young as they do estrogen, but they still don't call to stas throne.  Our hormones, right? It's always just older male hormone. Yeah, it's always the male hormone. Yeah, so even though we really need it, just like men and it has many of the same effects of preserving, our brains, and our bones, and our bodies. And that's that's important to say because it when you say testosterone, people tend to think one of two things, they tend to think of these no-neck monstrosity is and lift weights and bulk up and they tend to think of sex, right? We will talk later today about the sex related.  Ex of replacing testosterone pros and cons before that, there, there are issues for replacing testosterone. As you said, everybody will lose their testosterone. And it's part of the decline of Aging that leads to complications like quickness of thought General satisfaction of mood. The sense of well-being that people have motivation is even a testosterone dependent. Absolutely emotion. So people who aren't motivated anymore because  Because there are 45 or 47. It's a lack in females. It's the lack of motivation from lack of testosterone. Well, and it's fascinating to me. And I know this is anecdotal, not scientific. But but if you watch television, there are lots and lots of ads out. Now, for Super T of one, kind or another for men, and they show Men at Work who don't have any energy and her just kind of flat. It's not focused on the sex is focused on becoming alive. Having energy being alert, being functional, being yourself.  They said, well, you know, there's this one that some guy at a party is like a shadow a wave just drifting around then he takes super teeny comes back and everybody's going like, hi, Bill and yeah, and they don't show any of that for women know, they don't even acknowledge really the General Medical Community except for works like this and books like this, don't really acknowledge. The testosterone is even something we need or that it was even a prevalent testosterone hormone when before menopause are  for andropause really well. And that brings me to starting at this hour. I usually start at the back on these articles that because that's where they write their summary and scientific articles are sometimes tedious to get through. So I just want to get to the point. And at the end of this article, there are some conclusions that they make, and I'd like to reference one of them. Because it's the point that you just made says, the emphasis must be made that no specific testosterone product is approved for use in women in most countries yet.  Quickly, it has been and continues to be in widespread usage for women because women have a way of getting what we want. We do. We I mean if we have to, if we can't go through the door, then we're going to go through the window and things that are really important to us. And this is important to us. We want to be as well as men want to be. And we spent much more time trying to be well, going to the doctor every year. Usually women have varying. Don't ya and men don't. But, and women are trying to keep their families.  Well, as, in addition to keeping themselves. Well, so we spend a lot of time with Healthcare and we read all of this stuff. Like what we're doing today. We read. We listen, we talk to our friends and when they find something that really works for them and they feel better than and they have the data behind it. You know, they usually come in and go. Oh here are the Articles, you know that my other doctor gave me which is great. I used to laugh doing therapy over 30 year period with families because men would come in and I would try to get a history of you know, well what's been going on?  Your life and men classically, don't know what illnesses. They've had what medicines they take, when, or how they were sick. And their wives will have. All that information was very I actually asked to bring wives that they will say. Oh no, you have measles when you were 12 and you had this and you're allergic to that in the mirror looking down. Like I know that because it's taking all of you I know and and and so then if there's a divorce or death and the woman is gone and the guy doesn't have a daughter to come in and  Take on that responsibility. He's really in trouble and that's not every guy because I have lots of people that come see, I take care of men as well. And, you know, God love them. They come in and some of them are very compulsive and have everything written down and then some of them come in. And I start asking this is definitely an aside. I asked them. I look at the handwriting and it just really looks feminine. And usually say, did you fill out this form of your symptoms and they kind of don't know. My wife did and so they don't even know they're tired. They're wife thought they're tired. They're their wife's.  They had a bad sex Drive North, you know, so they're wife filled it all out and they're coming in handing me the paper eyes. And so I have to go back. Okay, let's see. These are your symptoms. Let's go back over these. Well, you know, is that women think about it and they are aware of it and we deserve it, concentrate on it. And so when it's not available to them in the classic Delivery Systems, you go find a way to get it. Yeah, and it's not like we're getting something like this shit about steroids. We're getting, we're getting.  Our axes that are from pharmaceutical pharmacies who make it up, or we go to our doctors and ask for what we need. Like it's an off-label use of an FDA-approved medicine, right? That's right. And as a physician, it's within your legitimate, legal medical perogative. To use an FDA-approved drug in an off-label what we use. I mean, we've  Talk about this in the past. But but there are many drugs. In fact, every doctor uses some drug off-label, because there are many reasons, the FDA won't approve a drug for certain use. Sometimes the drug doesn't have a patent. So, no one's going to spend money to make sure to proved. Yeah, to do the studies to prove, that it works for certain thing. And sometimes they've approved it for one thing and they figure, oh, we're going to sell it off. Label. Anyway, why should we have to go back and spend another million?  Dollars to prove that it works for the Second Use. So testosterone is an FDA-approved hormone when it's in a pure form. When it's compounded by a an FDA regulated Pharmacy, which is what we all use, then we can write the prescription, the pharmacy can fill it, right. So that's under our licensure we can do that. And that's how medicine changes. Well, that's how we get these. Oh, yeah, that's how information base grows right. Now. This works and women weren't  Listen, I don't think we'd see testosterone for women, for a long time because this is is huge. Women want to have this for ourselves as well. Yes, another conclusion that this article makes. And by the way, the article is called a rationale for treating hypo and Rajan ISM in women by Susan are Davis. It's Lotus hostage in the Journal of gender specific medicine, but the conclusion says, no woman will die from testosterone deficiency, but if the link between  Between testosterone, depletion and depression of well-being is established. In addition to the effects on libido. Testosterone therapy will be a therapy to be considered by all women. That's right. So, so her emphasis here, because there are already known positive outcomes in regard to libido, but her argument is there are other factors that women are concerned about like mood and depression and bone density and breast cancer that if they, it testosterone and these links are  Investigated now and being confirmed that this testosterone replacement is something that every woman ought to think about having. Since since medicine has found all these interesting ways to make us live to 100. This is the way to live. Well to 100 with fewer diseases and fewer medicines. Because if you take testosterone and you eat something, if you eat something with calcium and take vitamin D, you make bone, you don't have to take Fosamax or one of those other medications which have big side effects.  It cost a lot of money, right? And aren't the as effective at making really thick, strong bone, but they make bone that's thicker than you would have had before, right? But it's not as good as testosterone more brittle. Yeah. So so there's some terms that are used in this article. It is a scientific journal and the presumption is, you know, these words.

Paul langerhans, the islets of langerhans constitute, approximately 1% to 2% of the mass of the pancreas structure. There are about 1 million islets distributed throughout the pancreas of a healthy adult human. 914 Each of which measures about 0.2 m in diameter. 914 each is separated.  Separated from the surrounding pancreatic tissue by a thin fibrous connective tissue capsule, which is continuous with the fibrous connective tissue. That is interwoven throughout the rest of the pancreas. 914. The combined mass of the islets is 1 to 1.5 G histology hormones produced in the islets of langerhans are secreted directly into the blood flow by five types of cells. In Rat islets, endocrine cell subsets are distributed as follows alpha cells producing.  Kagan beta cells producing insulin and amylin Delta cells producing somatostatin PP cells, producing pancreatic polypeptide. Epsilon cells producing:. It has been recognized that the Sitka texture of pancreatic islets differs between species in particular while Road. And islets are characterized by a predominant proportion of insulin-producing beta cells in the core of the cluster. And by scarce Alpha, Delta and PP cells in the periphery human  Let's display Alpha and beta cells in close relationship with each other. Throughout the cluster, eyelets can influence each other through, paracrine and autocrine communication and beta cells are coupled electrically to other beta cells function. The paracrine feedback system of the islets of langerhans, has the following structure glucose insulin, activates beta cells and inhibits alpha cells glycogen glucagon, activates alpha cells which activates beta cells and Delta cells.  Somatostatin inhibits alpha cells and beta cells, a large. Number of g-protein coupled receptors regulates the secretion of insulin glucagon and somatostatin from pancreatic islets. And some of these gpcrs are the targets of drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes, electrical activity, electrical activity of pancreatic islets has been studied, using patch-clamp techniques. It has turned out that the behavior of cells in intact islets differs significantly.  Gently from the behavior of dispersed cells, clinical significance, diabetes, the islets of langerhans, contain beta cells which secrete insulin and play a significant role in diabetes, transplantation, restoration of metabolic control. Via the transplantation of islets of langerhans. Is an appealing approach. This can be achieved by transplantation of the pancreas as vascularized organ or of isolated pancreatic islets islet.  Plantation has emerged as a viable option for the treatment of insulin. Requiring diabetes in the early 1970s with steady progress over the last three decades. Islet transplantation has the possibility of restoring beta cell function, from diabetes, offering an alternative to a complete pancreas transplantation or an artificial pancreas. Because the beta cells in the islets of langerhans are selectively destroyed by an autoimmune process in type 1, diabetes.  Ins and researchers are actively pursuing islet transplantation. As a means of restoring physiological beta cell function in patients with type 1 diabetes. Recent clinical trials, have shown that insulin Independence, and improved metabolic control can be reproducibly obtained after transplantation of cadaverous donor, islets into patients with unstable type 1, diabetes, islet, transplantation for type 1. Diabetes, currently requires potent, immunosuppression to prevent host rejection of donor.  Let's an alternative source of beta cells. Such insulin-producing cells, derived from adult stem cells or progenitor cells. Would contribute to overcoming the shortage of donor, organs for transplantation. The field of regenerative medicine is rapidly, evolving and offers, great. Hope for the nearest Future. However, type 1 diabetes is the result of the autoimmune destruction of beta cells in the pancreas. Therefore, an effective cure will require a sequential  Rated approach that combines adequate and safe. Immune interventions with beta cell regenerative approaches.

Creator has been used for the treatment of patients with diabetes before the development of  Recombinant, human insulin technology, several studies in small and large animals models, have shown that transplantation of islet cells across species is possible. However, several problems need to be overcome for porcine islet, transplantation to become a viable clinical option. The immunogenicity of Zen Organic, tissues may be different from and even stronger than allergenic tissues. For instance. Gal. Alpha 1-3. Gal beta 1-4, glcnac.  Expressed on porcine cells, represents a major barrier to xenotransplantation being the target of preformed antibodies present in human blood. Remarkable progress has been recorded in the development of genetically modified pigs. Lacking or overexpressing molecules? That may improve acceptance of transplanted tissues across into humans. Pigs lacking, alpha-gal or over expressing. Human Decay. Accelerating Factor amongst others have been generated to study the impact on transplanted outcome.  Non-human primate models. Another possible antigenic Target. Is the hangar Natsu. Doctor antigen. Assay oleic Acid found in pigs and not humans, which may contribute to immunogenicity of porcine islets.

       " 'hfLn2N8KepM': \"Inside this laboratory at the Ohio State University Medical Center, a complicated research project is underway. Dr. Amir rishabh is a transplant surgeon who specializes in the study of the pancreas. And right now his focus is on one particular portion of the pancreas known as the islet cells only two to three percent from the whole pancreas. It called islet cell, a lot of langerhans and those are less cell, they make the hormones, insulin control our sugar. So when  You have diabetes, the pancreas, the barge. The big boss is making enzyme still working. You don't have that problem with that. But only these two to three percent stopped working in extreme cases, when a patient suffers life-threatening hypoglycemic episodes and is unable to regulate their blood sugar's, a pancreas transplant. Could be an option. Currently. Of course, the most successful treatment is whole pancreas transplantation and Ohio State actually among the top before.  Center in the world doing this procedure. Now, the question is, can we jump start the portion of the pancreas? That has stopped producing insulin. Dr. Raja believes, the answer lies in the extraction and transplantation of islet cells instead of the entire pancreas, he and his team can extract the islets from the pancreas of a deceased organ. Donor. The islets are then purified and processed. The theory is that once implanted directly into the recipients liver. The cells can begin to make and release insulin. We  Don't need to do all the things they measure. The major work is to work here. Actually, when I spent a few our hair with the whole staff to work on the pancreas, the vision is not here, which has a lot to do with it. I'm getting the pancreas. I am processing the pancreas to extract my eyelid. When I get the eyelid and the IQ test them, make sure they are in good quality. Then for the batian, it just an infusion. Recovery time would be dramatically easier than the major surgery of a pancreas transplant.  However, right now this procedure is still considered research. OSU does have a few patients on the waiting list for the islet transplant, while the doctors, wait for appropriate donors to major issue. As we mentioned one already supply of eyelid. I mean, we are the bending of generosity of a human being because we still using a disease or disease donor. The other major issue the time and effort to conduct. This research is extremely expensive because consider  search. All right, it's not clinical research or not covered by insurance and Ohio State, because they are so serious and so committed to science and for their Vision, they are, they are the one who put the grand, the money to cover the whole procedure, which is sick is very expensive. All Ohio, State leadership, put their money grant for me to proceed. They have not, they are getting nothing back for them, except patient.  Care and excellent service, which I think is very significant. Actually. No one knows how long it will take to move this procedure from the research phase to a routine treatment, but more than 1 million patients with type 1, diabetes are hoping dr.

       " 'hFMF3lJUcAc': \"All the energy on our planet Earth. Comes  It's from the Sun but we humans much like every other animal are not able to directly harvest the energy that comes from the sun plants. Do this work for us in their leaves plants contain a green pigment called chlorophyll, that enables them to use the energy from the Sun to combine water, and carbon dioxide and turn them into oxygen and the sugar glucose. This process is called photosynthesis, glucose is the most abundant sugar in nature.  And in stores, the energy coming from the Sun in a form that can then be used by plants and animals as well. Glucose can also be further processed to other more complex, carbohydrates, such as starch for longer-term, energy storage or even transform to other nutrients such as lipids amino acids or vitamins, sometimes incorporating minerals that are found in the soil by eating plants or animals. Who previously ate plants, we can get these molecules and use them to sustain our  On life. Without plants on this planet, we would not be able to survive. We will still have plenty of energy coming from the Sun, but no way of using it, it would be like being thirsty in the middle of the ocean surrounded by water. But water. We cannot drink carbohydrates, are at the basis of human diet. The words all over rice pasta bread, potatoes, cassava banana corn. Our staple foods for billions of people and are primarily sources.  Of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates means hydrated, carbon in the end. That's what the plants do. When they combine water. And carbon dioxide to make glucose. They split water into oxygen hydrogen and add these molecules to carbon creating energy-rich bonds. When these bonds will be broken down. They will be able to release the energy that they store this process, which is cellular respiration, is basically the opposite of photosynthesis.  The and is what happens inside all of our cells to extract energy from nutrients. This molecule is glucose also called dextrose. It contains six atoms of carbons, bound to each other and two atoms of hydrogen and oxygen. The primary function of glucose is, of course, an energetic one. It gives us 4 kilocalories per gram, glucose is not our only source of energy. We can also get energy from other carbohydrates as well as fat and protein.  However, glucose is the easiest molecule to get energy from it is readily available fuel for all of our cells. It also has another big advantage in emergency situations when our oxygen supply is limited for example, during intense physical activity. We can extract some energy from glucose even without oxygen. Whereas, for example, we cannot burn any fat without oxygen for these reason while fat is our main fuel at  at rest and during light activity, glucose becomes our main fuel during intense physical activity, when blood and oxygen supply to our muscle cells become scarce, but this doesn't mean that we don't need glucose for energy. Even when we are at rest, glucose is always necessary to completely burn fat for energy. Without the intermediate molecules that derive from glucose breakdown fats can only be broken down partially and release their energy.  In completely like biochemists, like to say, fat burns on the flame of carbs on top of that there are some tissues in our body that can get their energy only from glucose. These include our brain or nervous system in general and our red blood cells for all these reasons. We must have a certain amount of glucose circulating in our blood stream at all times. And as we will soon, learn our body goes to extreme lengths to ensure that  At a constant supply of glucose is always maintained. For example, in emergency situations when blood glucose levels, start to Dangerously, drop. Our body can build its own glucose starting from proteins, but this is a waste because proteins are normally used for more important structural and Regulatory functions, besides since our body doesn't store extra protein. We may need to steal these proteins from our lean mass. For example, our muscles.  So, this indirectly is another important function of glucose. It's a precious proteins from being used as sources of glucose and energy. Another important function of blood glucose is to Signal hunger and satiety. You already know that it high or raising blood glucose signals and it's time to stop eating while the law or dropping blood, glucose signals that it's time to eat again. So to recap, these are the main functions of glucose in our body.  It provides readily available energy for our body at rest. And during life activity. It is the only source of energy during intense an aerobic physical activity. It provides energy for our brain, nervous system, and red blood cells at all times. It allows an efficient utilization of fats for energy. It's Paris proteins from uses source of energy, and blood glucose, and it's blood variation, signal hunger and satiety glucose, and other sugars also play more fun.  Fine tuned structural and Regulatory functions in our body. For example, they are often used as tags for molecules to traffic them inside our cells or indicate their destination. They are also part of complex structures on the surface of our cell. Membranes that play a role in signaling cell-cell, communication recognition and Immunity cell surface glycosaminoglycans, protect and lubricate our joints and most of our tissues, a particular sugar.  Ribose is a key structural component of our DNA. All these Advanced functions of sugars. However, are not strictly relevant from a nutritional point of view because nutritionally sugars are non-essential. This means that our body can easily enter convert sugars into one another or build them starting from other molecules. So, whenever it needs to build a particular sugar contain molecule, it can easily build a sugar components in meat without having to  get them directly from food. This is not possible. For example, for many amino acids involved in protein synthesis, as well as some lipids.\",\n",
       " 'hg1gPLAG9Q4': \"The reality is.  My gastroparesis and my chronic illnesses. Have taken over my life.  The past couple weeks and especially the past few days.  Haven't been able to eat not doing well.  But I have not given up. Hope I see my doctor tomorrow.  But it is hard, it gets really hard and I'm not going to lie about it, to make it seem easier or better than it is because that wouldn't be spreading. Genuine awareness of what it's like to live with a chronic illness. And that's one of my main goals of having these Vlogs in this YouTube channel.  I'm sure there's somebody out there who can relate to what I'm dealing with right now. And that's another goal to let people know. They're not alone in the hard days of their chronic illnesses. And if I lied about it and tried to make it better than it seems, then I want to be being honest with y'all and I always want to be honest with you guys. So  This is my reality right now. My gastroparesis is getting bad. It's getting scary, but I haven't given up. Hope. We'll figure out a solution.  So I'm going to try and put myself together so I can start my Tuesday. All right. I am slowly making my way down the stairs after getting myself together. Got my helpful pup here and I see that Judd has put my Walker at the bottom of the stairs because he knew I need it today. He knows me really well. It's waiting for me right there. It's definitely going to be a walker kind of day. So I'm just going to give you all an update on where we are with my God.  Roper eso's, so I used to handle my GP fine with IV anti-nausea meds that we put through my port and small meals, avoiding certain foods, but it progressively became worse. And at first, I was using IV zofran and that worked well for me, but as my GP became progressively worse, I needed more of it and it became expensive so insurance that no more IV, Zofran. They gave me IV. Phenergan recently found out I'm allergic to IV Phenergan. So now I have IV Compazine which my home health.  Company delivered to me last night, and Compazine is very similar to Phenergan. So we're worried. I'm going to react negatively to it. So that's why on Thursday or Friday. A nurse is going to come to my house to be with me. The first time I take IV Compazine and the thing is I have to take the Compazine before we can appeal the IV Zofran because insurance is very unlikely to approve IV Zofran unless I try all other options first, which is the Compazine next. So got to do that. Unfortunately, that's just how insurance is.  As far as oral medications. Go for GP. There's reg lab, which we found out. I'm allergic to there is this  Erythromycin, I can't pronounce it. That one interacts negatively with one of my other medications I really need. So it's not a good option for me. And then there's like do pará Dome something like that. And that one has the potential to cause irregular heart rhythms, and I already have a ton of PVCs and packs and pull applications and tachycardia from my pots. And, you know, I can cause chest pain and flip flops and very uncomfortable. So that's not a good option for me, either. So, there's  Not many treatment options for gastroparesis in the way of oral medications and I can't just rely on IV. Anti-nausea meds because gastroparesis is delayed stomach emptying so slow digestion, or maybe no digesting it all with me now, because it's gotten to the point where I cannot eat anything at all. And when I force feed myself, I puke it back up and I have not had a meal or sustenance in over a week practically. So, anyways, I can't rely on IV, anti-nausea meds because  It takes away the nausea or helps with it at least, but it doesn't help with the partial paralyzation, the slow digestion. So then there's also feeding tubes and a lot of you have asked me about getting a feeding tube. I don't know if that's a good option for me, or if I can get one or if it's going to help because I haven't seen my doctor yet, but I'll know about all my treatment options tomorrow when I see her. If she does tell me, I need a feeding tube and it's going to improve my quality of life. I'm not going to fight.  Turn on it because I'm really struggling right now and I need some relief and I trust my doctor, so my pots and some of my other chronic illnesses are also doing poorly because I'm not getting enough calories for my body to fight these illnesses and I can't drink enough water that. I usually drink my 2.5 liters of water a day to help with my pots. So now my pots is also giving me a lot of issues and I'm thankful that I have.  My infusions. I think this is the only thing that's really keeping me out of the hospital right now. So I'm going to go ahead and hook up to this. I'm all hooked up. I also pushed an IV Zofran. We had some left over from when insurance was approving that we had five. Now. We have four and it's helped some with the nausea think goodness, but unfortunately, I don't know if I can eat. Hopefully, it'll allow me to at least drink some water. I'm just really feeling the effects of not eating, just weakness, exhaustion.  But I am thankful for things. I'm still thankful for the support. Y'all give me the support. I got from Jud, even though he is worried about me. I'm worried too. And I'm thankful that I see my doctor tomorrow and I'm thankful for Harlow. She helps me so much. I forgot to get a blanket before I sat down and the act of getting up to get it myself.  Takes so much energy with the state. I'm in right now. So she's going to help me out.  Good girl, come here. Hit the oh good girl. Thank you so much. Pop your good dog.  Those are my slippers you giving them kisses, you good girl. I rested on the couch for a little bit. I uploaded the Vlog and launched my patreon page, and I'm really happy to say the initial response has been really positive. Thank you. If you visited my patreon page, there's a link in the description. If you want to check it out and I made Harlow's breakfast. Today is prep day. I'm supposed to prep her raw meals for a week in advance, but I do not have the strength or ability to do that. So I'm just  Going to do the best I can with in my circumstances because that's all I can expect of myself. And right now, the best I can do is just making her breakfast. So that's going to have to work. Don't look skeptical, there is me under there. I promise, okay.  I'm serious. Okay, you don't have to do anything. I'm feeling way to drain to make you do stuff for your food. Is it frustrating that I can't prep Harlow's food? Like I planned. Yes, is it frustrating that my stomach is partially paralyzed. And I cannot eat, even though my body is starving. Yes. Is it frustrating that I want to eat? Even though I'm nauseous? And if I force feed myself, to even take a few sips of my ensure, I'll start to vomit. Yes, but  These are the circumstances I find myself in. So I'm just going to do the very best I can because that's all I can expect of myself. It is not my fault that my gastroparesis is flaring like this and I'm not going to put myself down for it because my chronic illness is already do enough of that. For me. I am just going to stay hopeful and do the very best. I can Jones home from work. Carlos, happy he's here. So this morning I called my doctor because Judds actually getting really worried.  It about me and nothing usually makes some worry too much. So I called my doctor and talk to them about if going to the hospital would be worth it. And honestly, they said all they would do is give me fluids and IV Zofran, which I have here at home. So that's why we're not going to the hospital waiting for my appointment, but we can make it right babe. I mean, I'm going to make it whether or not you Meg has a whole nother story. I'll be okay. Say goodbye.  People by the people. Mhm. Love you, babe. Have a good day. I love you Harlow. She's following you.  No, she won't. You be a horrible. K-9. Officer. Don't take her. No, don't take her John. I don't take her. Okay. Love you, babe. Hi Carlo. Come here. Let me see you. Make sure he didn't actually take you. There. She is. He didn't actually take you, good girl. I was just been laying here going in and out of sleep because  I'm too tired to do anything else. Had about four steps of my ensure over the past few days. I haven't even had a whole one. I've just had a few sips when I'm able to going to keep sleeping now.  Well, Jack is, she's relaxing in the house. So tomorrow, we have the doctor's appointment and I wish it would have came sooner because I mean, just sitting there and watching someone just kind of with her away. It's kind of kind of sad that's worrisome for me, especially super warriors on Jemima just a blogger earlier, but the, we've decided the appointment doesn't go, according.  doesn't like,  Produce any new results or anything new. Then we're probably in am going to take her to the hospital because she hasn't had a solid meal for like, two weeks now. So and it is way beyond our care. Our quality of care at our house. So hopefully the doctor tomorrow will produce something new and something that's going to help, but we'll see.  Yeah, we will see. We're going to bed.  Obviously had a rough day. I've been getting some questions. One is, do I feel hunger. No, I don't the think of GP is delayed stomach emptying and since my stomach doesn't empty properly. No signal is sent to my brain to say hey, we're hungry. Also, I'm bloated experiencing stomach, pain, and nausea on top of that. So I'm not going to be hungry with all that to. And then somebody else. A lot of people asked what  One you eat. I instantly feel worse with my nausea and bloating and stomach pain, and then give it about 15 to 30 minutes and I'll vomit profusely anything and more. So, that's really counterproductive. And I've stopped Force feeding myself. It's just not worth the vomiting. So maximum or dehydrate.\",\n",

The research team found that those who carried the risk Gene had significantly, lower insulin, secretion. All of the study participants had an increase in blood sugar, after three months of melatonin treatment, those with a carrier Gene. However, were much more likely to have higher blood sugars.

       " 'HOwqo56BKQU': \"Hello, I'm Tom Mason of the diabetes Council.com researcher writer and I have type 2 diabetes Now. I want to emphasize that my perspective is coming from one with type 2 and not type 1 diabetes. Our channel is primarily for those with type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes today. I want to answer the question. What is postprandial blood?  Koko's and why should people with pre-diabetes know about it?  After you watch the video today, I invite you to check out the description box for my new ebook. This is one of the most comprehensive diabetes meal planning books. You can find anywhere it contains diabetes friendly meals and recipes recipes for different goals such as eight hundred two 1800 calories per day meal plans diabetes meal planning tips and tricks. There are also tons of diabetes friendly recipes for everyone.  There are a lot of big terms out there aren't there and you really need to know what some of those terms are and why they are important one such term postprandial blood glucose.  Now the term postprandial glucose might sound like jargon but it literally means sugar after the meal. So what we are talking about here is the blood glucose reading at about one to two hours after a large meal. Now that part is pretty simple to answer but why should you know what that number is? Well, some of you with pre-diabetes are checking your blood sugar in the mornings some might not be  Really depends on your control and want your doctor thinks is best. But if you're only testing first thing in the morning, you might be missing the full picture in my research. I came across an interesting article in everyday Health some of what I'm about to say about PPG or postprandial glucose is from that article. You see the first morning glucose level check is usually the lowest of the day and checking only in the morning is kind of like  It purposefully blindfolding yourself to only see the best case scenario. If you want to see a more complete picture mix it up check your glucose level at various times during the day. Now the Ada of the American Diabetes Association recommends checking the blood sugar levels before eating that's a fasting blood sugar and then again one to two hours after the beginning of the meal which is postprandial glucose.  Now particularly do this if the target A1C goals aren't being met the test after the meal called the postprandial glucose test. You might need to test your blood sugar at other times during the day or after certain activities depending on the information you and your medical team are trying to put together. You see that test is very very important to see what meals are doing especially certain meals to your plug.  glucose now those PPG numbers are affected by number variables including what you eat how active you are your insulin sensitivity and how quickly food moves through your stomach the postprandial glucose gives us information about how the body is able to manage the blood glucose after a meal it informs us that blood glucose has returned to normal or if it's up or down after the meal intake now when blood sugar spikes after meals and  Stays High. Well that could make a difficult for you to achieve your A1C and other blood sugar control goals. Now that's according to guidelines published by the American Association of clinical Endocrinology. Just if your A1C continues to be higher than your target goal your chance of developing complications increases, especially your chance of developing type two. So the PPG can help troubleshoot those problems.  By measuring your postprandial glucose, you can determine whether dietary modifications or pre-meal bolus insulin is needed to reduce these spikes. Now if you have pre-diabetes, that's probably not going to happen. But if you achieve your Premier glucose targets, but your A1C remains above Target, then you really need to monitor that very very closely and talk to your doctor about it learning how to count carbs can help you achieve your PP goals  Herbs contribute significantly more to your postprandial glucose then fat and protein and so checking it regularly can help you figure out the best balance of carbs fats and proteins. Now, I know this is a lot to take in and for some of you your doctor is not having you take a postprandial glucose, but at some point you make so I hope that this has been informative for you.  Don't forget to get my new ebook and please subscribe to our channel for many more videos like this one in the future. I want to thank you so much for watching. I'm time Mason.\",\n",
       " 'HRTKfRXwBTg': \"I've talked about the role meet may play an increasing the risk of diabetes and the potential protective role of healthy plant foods, but plant-based diet is not only appear to guard against getting diabetes in the first place. They may successfully treat the disease better than diabetic. Diets patients are typically placed on controlling weight and cholesterol diet is based on whole plant foods. Can result in significant weight loss without any limits on portion size, or calorie counting. Because plant Foods tend to be so calorically. Here's 100, calories of broccoli, tomatoes, and strawberries, compared that to 100 calories of chicken cheese or fish. People just can't seem to eat enough to compensate for the calorie deficit. So lose weight, eating whole plant foods and most importantly, it works better plant based diet, beat out the confession. American Diabetes Association died in a head-to-head, randomized, controlled clinical trial without restricting Porsches. No calorie or carb.  Owning a review of all such studies found. The individuals. Following plant-based diets experience improved reductions in blood sugar's body weight and cardiovascular risk. Compared with those following diets. That included animal products. And cardiovascular risk is what, kills diabetics. The most are more likely to get strokes more likely, heart failure. In fact, diabetes has been proposed as a coronary heart disease. Risk equivalent, meaning diabetic patients, without a history of coronary disease. Have an equivalent risk to  Those non-diabetic individuals with confirmed heart disease. A newer study used a technique to actually measure insulin sensitivity, improved on both diets in the first three months, but then the veg diet pulled ahead and look at their LDL cholesterol. That's what we see when people are put on a plant-based diets. Cholesterol comes down so much can actually reverse the athletes closest progression. Reverse the progression.  Session of heart disease. We know about the beneficial effect of vegetarian diets on controlling way blood sugar is cholesterol insulin sensitivity and oxidative stress compared to Conventional diabetic diets. What about quality of life, mood? How do people feel after making such a dramatic change in their diets in this randomized, controlled trial. Study subjects were assigned either to a plant-based diet, group or control group vegetables, grains beans, fruits and nuts with animal products limited to a maximum of  Daily portion of low-fat yogurt and the control group got the official diabetes diet quality of life improved on both dies in the first few months, but within six months, the plant based group clearly pulled ahead. Same thing with depression scores dropped in both groups in the first three months, but started to Rebound in the control group, bottom line, the more plant-based diet led to a greater Improvement in quality of life and mood patients.  Consuming a vegetarian diet, also felt less constrained than those consuming. The conventional diet people actually felt the conventional diabetic diet was more restrictive than the plant-based diet disinhibition decreased with a vegetarian diet. Meaning those eating vegetarian were less likely to binge and the veg group folks, tended to feel less hungry, all of, which helps with sustainability in the long term, which is, of course, critical for changing diet. So, not only do plant-based diets appear to work better, but they may be easier to  Stick to with the Improvement. In mood patients, May exhibit desired improvements. Not only in physical, but also in mental health.\",\n",
       " 'HSJVVLcUcus': \"In this session. What I wanted to do is to kind of go over your assignment dealing with carbohydrate counting. The assignment is called my food plan because what we're going to be using is a kind of a universal planning document that can be used and is used in even different countries. It's very general it. Maybe not as specific as what you might find at a hospital in this country whatever, but it's a very general one that would give you the idea. Idea of how to do carbohydrate counting. You should understand that diabetics need to really watch their carbohydrates. That's the most important thing because the carbohydrates are going to turn into sugars and they're going to be the most important consideration in your diet, is what turns into sugars. Not so much proteins, not so much fat, but the carbohydrate that you  you take in which is going to be broken down into sugars, get into your bloodstream influence insulin, nessus levels and really wreak havoc with your blood sugar regulation. So what a diabetic is sent home with and what they're trained to do is to look at their carbohydrates and do a process called carbohydrate counting. So, I just wanted to give you a little bit of  Information on that and have you actually do a simulated carbohydrate counting exercise, that would teach you how it's done and kind of give you a little indication, maybe even empathy for someone that has to watch their carbohydrates and what they have to think about day in and day out. So, I wanted to teach you about that. So the first thing I  want you to do is you're going to be looking at and upload you should have downloaded and copied off your assignment page and instructions from that information. Then let's go through and teach you what you're actually going to have to document and what you're going to have to actually upload for me. So the first thing you want to do and it's kind of simulating the idea that a dime.  It is going to come in and to a dietitian or to a healthcare provider and they're going to be newly diagnosed as a diabetic and what you're going to do. And what or what the health care provider would do is look at their intake and try to come up with a plan that they could take home with them. That would help them to do their  Hydrate counting. So, the first thing that I would like you to do, is to determine choices. Now, in this carbohydrate counting, they label the amount of cabbage carbohydrates servings as choices. And so you'll have carb choices, you'll have protein choices and you'll have fat choices. So they don't really call them servings, they call them choices. So what you're going to do is look at your 3 Day, average page that you did for your diet study.  You're going to need that and you're going to need to look at the 32 average. Look at the intake and dri goals compared page and then look at the column. This is Dri. Now. This is going to be your goals. All right, and this is really what you're going. You would send the diabetic home with person is the goals that they need to meet for that. And so, for our purposes on your three days.  Average page. What you'll notice is that they actually give you a range, you know, for example, the carbohydrates 296 2428. Well, what, what we're going to determine and I, I noticed, I have a mistake on there already. It should be 58 percent because if you remember from your diet study, you needed 58 percent calories carbohydrates. I think the  Nation is correct. But what we're going to use is those percentages. So what I did was took the to 62 63 five calories times point zero five, zero point five eight, which is 58% divide that by 4 calories per gram and what that gives you is 382 G that our goal is for carbohydrates and then the 30% for lipids and so forth. So what you would do then is determine your carbohydrate.  Choices, so, take your carb grams and you're going to divide that by 15. Now. I'll explain later why it's 15, but basically for now one choice of carbohydrate it represented by 15 grams. So, so for every 15 grams of carbs you eat that would equal one choice. So we're going to determine how many choices. So in our example, here we had  To so be 382 / 15 would get us a certain amount of choices. The proteins are going to be 7. So for every seven grams or basically one ounce for every ounce of protein, we intake for a ra 7 oz, 7 grams, and that's going to be one choice and then fats are going to be 5. So on this slide, I kind of represented that except again, the 48 percent at the end of The Arrow, should be  8%. Sorry about that. And then we have the 30 and 12, so of our fast, thirty percent and 12 percent, so that's kind of what we did with our diet study and did that, so you can determine your grams and then determine your choices by divide, making those divide numbers, then what I want you to do is look at your corner current choices, which would be based on your intake. So we're going to do the same thing, but we're going to look at the intake column and you're going to have those.  Is G, and so there are set. So you just divide the cards by 15, the protein by 7 in, the fat by 5. And that will give you the number of choices you have now. So, this would be kind of simulating that this person who has been newly diagnosed as diabetic and you look at their diet. And this is what they're eating now. And hopefully you'll see that there's going to be some differences between what your goals are and what you're actually in teh in.  Intake is. So we're kind of forcing you to become a diabetic.  So what you would do then is just kind of compare those. So on a separate piece of paper. What I'm asking you to do is show your calculations and show me that, you understand that the carbohydrates / 15 and so forth. And just put that into a Word document or you could put that on an Excel sheet or however. And then you'd want to save that and then you're going to upload that and save it to the assignment page.  Each and then you know, I'll be able to access that and make sure. So again on a separate piece of paper as a Word document or as an Excel file, whatever you want save that. And then you're going to upload that into your formation. So but like I mentioned our are  Food plans going to be based on our goals. So the be the dri column. So look at the dri column, the first one you did and those choices and we're going to use those. And so go into the website and on your assignment, click on the, my food plan worksheet. And you'll notice also on that sheet, you you have the power points, which you're looking at now and the my food plan instructions.  And but when you click on the worksheet, what you'll end up was looking at a page that looks like this. And so it's the, my food plan, you're able to write on that page. And so you can put your name in and everything. So it'll say you'll notice that needle upper left-hand column. It'll say that you're able to write on that. So type in your name, type in the date and everything.\",\n",

And after I answered the question that says, you are at risk for Contracting diabetes.  That's when Lynette, an Oprah surviving spouse who lives in Columbus signed up for the diabetes prevention program through her local YMCA, Lynette is one of nearly 600 opers retirees and eligible dependents, taking part in the year-long program held at nearly 100 locations throughout Ohio. Like this one. The program is designed to prevent or delay diabetes, for those at risk and focuses on healthy, eating and physical activity. We have a diabetes epidemic in this country more than 30 million.  Have the disease. Another 90 million are at risk for developing diabetes and 90 percent of them don't even know it. The program is open to opers pre Medicare retirees enrolled in the opers Medical. Mutual health care plan, Medicare plans to cover the program as a benefit. Beginning in 2018. It's proven to get results. Diabetes is preventable. The National Institutes of Health has shown that programs like ours are proven to reduce the number of new cases, of type 2 diabetes by 58 percent overall.  All and 71% and people over the age of 60. We're really happy to be able to offer this program to our retirees and their dependents.  The diabetes prevention program through the YMCA is a year-long community based program. Participants meet 425 sessions with a certified lifestyle coach in a classroom setting with a focus on lifestyle and behavioral change. The curriculum is approved by the Centers for Disease Control and prevention to mangoes are seven percent weight loss, and increased activity, 150 minutes a week. We try to keep them focused. The engagement is awesome, the excitement and come.  And initially, I think there's some hesitation and a little fear, especially when you mention they're being weighed in every week. Of course, no one likes. That the program emphasizes teamwork eating, right? And increasing physical activity on your own. Participants have access to the sponsoring YMCA, including Fitness classes throughout the year. We teach each individual what works for them. It's not your quick fix fad diets. It's  Not a diet program at all, you know, pre-diabetes when you hear that, you know, Bells go off in your mind, but when I got here and the staff and the people, I mean they just made you feel welcome. And it's like we will help you be successful. That success is ever more important in the face of the changing Healthcare landscape, opers Research, indicates that the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes within our retiree population.  Or exceeds that of the United States. As a whole, we believe more than 15,000 enrollees in the opers health care, plan administered by Medical Mutual a pre-diabetic. So you can see the value of this program, in promoting our members, good health, and the quality of life in their retirement. And Oprah's is hoping the participants, like Lynette can keep diabetes away through the YMCA program. That was a couch potato. And you know, wasn't active at all in the fact that they made it a requirement 150 minutes a week.  A week you must be active. So I have gone beyond that. I've gone above that but the challenges make you aware of what you're doing, right? And especially what you're doing wrong. And that should keep Lynette and others in the program free from diabetes for years to come.\",\n",

       " '90i0YXq5aA': \"We go now to our reporter. Laura, Windsor On Assignment. Pancreatic disease, also known as pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas. We asked dr. Come because, sorry, at Valley Presbyterian Hospital in the San Fernando Valley to explain the function of the pancreas and the symptoms of the disease. Pancreas is an organ that lives in the back wall of the belly. And the first portion of the small bowel. It is called the duodenum and that wraps it.  Itself around the head of the pancreas. And the pancreas has a set of channels that essentially collect all the pancreas juice. They bring them in and they enter into the bowel at a point where we call the ampulla of water. So that's that muscular door that allows pancreas juice to come out. Doesn't let intestinal juices to come back in. Right around the same area, is where the bile duct is, which is the tube that drains the liver.  And that pierces through the head of the pancreas comes in and joins the pancreatic duct. So both of these two beings, they drain their juices into the same spot into the intestines. It has several functions. One of them is the what we call the endocrine function, which is producing hormones, that allows the body to control several things. Inside. There is the main function of the pancreas, which is the exit.  Current function or its the amount of digestive juices that the pancreas makes that then come into the intestines and allow us to digest our food. So you need both functions to to have a normal healthy life. The most common cause of pancreas problems is essentially pancreatitis or swollen pancreas from things like gallstone disease, or alcohol.  Related issues, people who are obese. They're at a higher risk for gallstone formation, especially if you're a woman of childbearing age, for instance, alcohol, actually affects the pancreas cells themselves and it causes an internal injury to those cells. Those cells get swollen as well. They break down and they release these digestive enzymes that they were supposed to put into the pancreatic duct. So the whole gland gets  Gets infected gets swollen again and it can behave similar to gallstone pancreatitis where you can have very swollen pancreas. It can progress to necrotic pancreatitis, which is that pancreas and then also progress to infected necrosis. The problem with both of these issues any cause of pancreatitis is that, if the, if they cause of the pancreatitis keeps coming back, the pancreatitis will come back.  And then after enough of pancreatitis you get into what's called, chronic pancreatitis, but specifically for pancreatitis. If you live a healthy lifestyle, if you keep your cholesterol levels low, you have a lower chance of developing gallstone disease gallstone pancreatitis, certainly, if you're drinking in excess on a regular basis, you're putting yourself at a much higher chance of developing acute pancreatitis, and then that becomes an  Diction. Which then means that you are at a higher chance of developing chronic pancreatitis, very important that people understand that. Yeah, you have to have some expertise in this area. Not all Physicians are familiar with how to deal with this disease.\",\n",
       " 'Id2E72P8Fe0': \"Metabolism is just the flow of energy throughout the body energy, enters our body, when we eat food and that food is then absorbed in three different forms. It can be absorbed as amino acids. So things that make up proteins. So you'd imagine meet would have a lot of amino acids or they can be absorbed as fats. So these are lipids or fatty acids. And so your greasy fried food is pretty rich in fats.  Us, or they can be absorbed in carbohydrates. Or I'll just write carbs here, which you have a lot of in ice cream or other sweet things. Each of these things deliver energy into your GI tract, your stomach and your intestines which can then be absorbed and sent Elsewhere for use. Now carbohydrates are one of the main currencies for energy. So let's focus on that and will do so by starting with glucose, which is the most basic form of carbohydrates. In fact, it's considered a simple sugar. Now there.  Two main hormones, that control the availability of glucose throughout the body and they're in a constant tug-of-war with each other. One of them which you've heard of probably is called insulin, insulin regulates the storage of glucose as we'll talk more about in a minute and the other guy on the end of the Rope is a hormone called glucagon. Glucagon regulates the release of glucose from storage. And it's pretty important that we have enough glucose available.  Available in the blood because, for example, the brain uses about 120 grams of glucose per day. And that's a lot, because it comes out to be about 60, to 70 percent of all the glucose that we eat in a day. But to put it in terms that I think you, and I appreciate a little more, 120 grams of glucose comes out to be about 250 M&M's in a single day.  Now, that's a lot of Eminem's. So you can see why it's really important to have enough glucose available for your essential organs to use. And thankfully, we have these two hormones to help regulate the amount of glucose in our blood. So now let's take a look at how these hormones regulate, the amount of glucose in our blood and let's do that on this graph. So, let's say this axis represents time. So over time, we'll see some changes and this excess over here. The y axis will represent the  Centration of glucose in our blood. So, that's the concentration of glucose, and most commonly that'll be represented in milligrams. Per deciliter milligrams per deciliter. Now, the body likes to keep the amount of glucose in the blood to be no lower than about 70 milligrams per deciliter and no higher than about 120 milligrams per deciliter.  This is sort of the range that I would consider to be The Sweet Spot because if we go any higher than 120, then we end up having a condition that's called hyper hyper. Meaning a lot of glycemia hyperglycemia, which just means a lot of glucose in the blood. If we have hyperglycemia for a long period of time that can lead to, what's referred to as I nerve and kidney disease.  I nerve and kidney disease and we can go into a lot more detail about how this happens, but just understand that having a lot of glucose in, your blood can cause changes to these structures to make them not work as well. And unfortunately, this is a fairly common problem because another term for eye nerve and kidney disease is diabetes. And in fact, if you have a person who's been fasting overnight to come in for a blood test,  And you notice that they have more than 126 milligrams per deciliter of glucose on two different occasions, that's grounds for diagnosis of diabetes. On the other hand, if we have very little glucose in our blood or not enough, that condition is referred to as hypo glycemia hypo, meaning less or low and then glycemia, of course, meaning glucose.  And some of the things that you can start to notice, if your hypoglycemic is that you're tired, maybe you're lethargic. But if this persists, you can even go into a type of coma or even die from having too, little glucose in your blood. And in most people, we start to notice that we're feeling hypoglycemic when we get below, 40 milligrams per deciliter, now, usually our bodies pretty good about making sure that the level of glucose in our  Blood stays within the sweet spot or within this sweet range and the way we accomplish this is through the hormones. I just mentioned. So let's imagine that you eat at this point of time right here and naturally the level of glucose in your blood will rise because you've introduced more glucose into your system by eating. It eventually, your body will notice that your glucose levels are rising and will counter that by releasing insulin to drive the amount of  Glucose in your blood down, and that's an important point because insulin decreases, the blood glucose concentration, by storing the glucose in another form and we'll get into more detail about that in a second. The other thing that could happen is that you may have a decreasing amount of glucose in your blood, which as I mentioned here is not a good thing to have happen. Either what your body does to counter that is release glucagon.  To increase the amount of glucose in your blood. And so it's important to remember here as well. That glucagon will increase the serum or the blood concentration of glucose, by releasing it from Storage. So glucagon does the opposite, it releases glucose from Storage. So now that we know how the release of glucagon and Insulin can affect blood glucose levels.  Let's focus in and see how that happens. So let's start with insulin and that does a number of things to glucose. But remember that at the end of the day, all were doing is storing. It just remember insulin causes storage. So the first thing that insulin does to glucose is cause it to undergo a process known as glycolysis glycolysis, which you may have heard of before. It's an irreversible process.  Cess it's irreversible. All right, irreversible down here because it converts glucose into ATP which is the most basic unit of energy that we use in the body. And that's an important distinction. ATP is energy to be used anywhere in the body. Okay, instead of storing the energy of glucose and ATP insulin can cause glucose to undergo, what's called glyco Genesis. Glyco.  Genesis, which just means the formation of glycogen. So glycogen and glycogen is just a heavily branched polymer or molecule that has a whole bunch of glucose molecules stacked on top of it. And this is just energy to be stored in the short term in mainly the liver or muscle tissue. So mainly liver or muscle and this is a reversible process.  Because once we make glycogen, we can break it down and release glucose as well. Finally, the last thing insulin can cause glucose to do is undergo lipogenesis lipogenesis, which I think you can use the suffix to infer here that we are producing lipids or fatty acids. So lipids or fatty acids, and this is an irreversible process. So this is irreversible where we store glucose as  Lipid. And the key here is that we are taking the energy of glucose and we are storing it, long-term long-term in what's called adipose tissue adipose tissue, or just the fatty layers within our body. So, adipose tissue. Now, what about glucagon? What are the processes? It uses to release energy or glucose into the bloodstream. Let's put it this way. If we're releasing glucose into the bloodstream, Mike.  Question is, what are we releasing it from? Well, the first thing we can release it from is glycogen and we just talked about this. We can form glycogen using insulin, or if there's a lot of glucagon around, we can have what's called glyco.  Glyco Jen ol Isis, which just means the breaking down or the cutting down of glycogen. Now, this is a reversible process because we can always go and take glucose to make glycogen. Again. The other thing we can release glucose energy from is or rather. I should say, are amino acids, amino, acids can undergo a process known as gluco. Neo genesis.  Gluco, meaning glucose Neo, meaning a new. And then Genesis meaning to create or the creation of this is also a reversible process that will take amino acids. Bunch them together with other things to convert them into glucose. Now, finally, the last thing glucagon can do is to take fatty acid, so fatty acid or lipid and instead of converting it to glucose.  Glucagon will take the fatty acid and turned it into these things that are called Ketone bodies, Ketone bodies and it does so through a process known as keto short for Ketone Genesis meaning to generate Ketone bodies. Now, this is an irreversible process and it's kind of a funky thing that happens within the body because it's what we do when we're in our starvation mode.  We're not getting the right amount of nutrients for some reason or another. And the reason why this is sort of a last resort is because Ketone bodies are very unique in that. They are energy forms of energy to be used, only only  By the heart and brain Ketone bodies. Don't really supply energy anywhere else. So that's why it's sort of a last-minute starvation mechanism to provide energy where its most critically needed to help us survive. So you can sort of see here that there's a tug-of-war game that goes on between insulin and glucagon. In fact, insulin itself, when it's released into the blood will inhibit the release of glucagon.  Which just goes to show you how opposite their end goals, really are. And there's a lot more to talk about how insulin is released or how glucagon is released and where it comes from. This is a great overview of what they end up doing in the\",\n",
       " 'IE_ywuQoJSg': \"What's the status sister first to the bladder and itís refers to inflammation, there for cystitis describes an inflamed bladder, which is usually the result of a bacterial infection, but also can result from fungal infections. Chemical irritants foreign bodies like kidney stones as well as trauma.  Now a urinary tract infection or UTI is any infection of the urinary tract which includes the upper portion of the tracked, the kidneys in the ureters and the lower portion of the tract, the bladder and the urethra. So cystitis when it's caused by an infection is a type of lower UTI.  Lower UTIs are almost always caused by an ascending infection or bacteria. Typically, moved from the rectal area to the urethra and then migrate up the urethra and into the bladder. Having said that on rare occasions, a descending infection can happen as well, where bacteria starts in the blood or lymph. And then goes to the kidney and makes its way down to the bladder and urethra.  Normally urine sterile meaning bacteria doesn't live there. The composition of urine which has a high urea concentration and a low PH helps keep bacteria from setting up. Camp. Also though, the unidirectional flow in the act of urinating, also helps to keep bacteria from invading the urethra and bladder.  Some bacteria though are better at surviving in in resisting, these conditions and can stick to and colonize the bladder mucosa E.coli accounts, for the vast, majority of UTIs. Also, though, other gram-negative bacteria that can infect the bladder include. Klebsiella, Proteus interrobang, actor and citrobacter species. On the other hand, gram-positive bacteria can also cause problems like antara caucus species and staphylococcus, saprophytic asst, which is actually the second most  Cause overall, after E. Coli and particularly affects young sexually active women.  That's sad as far as risk factors. Go, sexual intercourse is a major risk factor because bacteria can be introduced into the urethra. And this is sometimes even referred to as honeymoon. Cystitis.  In general, women are at higher risk for cystitis than men due to having a shorter urethra. And this is because bacteria which are ascending up the urethra don't have to travel. As far also, in postmenopausal women. There's a decrease in estrogen levels, which causes the normal protective vaginal Flora to be lost. Increasing the risk of UTI. Other risk factors include presence of a Foley catheter in the urethra, which can introduce pathogens.  Another risk factor is having diabetes mellitus since people with diabetes, tend to have hyperglycemia or high blood glucose normally with an infection neutrophils move out of the circulatory system toward the infection called diapy desus as well as carry out phagocytosis, but hyperglycemia inhibits these processes making those neutrophils less effective at killing Invaders.  Also infant boys with for Skinner, on their penis, have a slightly higher risk of UTI. Compared to infant boys who have had a circumcision.  A final important risk factor is impaired bladder emptying, causing urinary stasis, which means your intends to sit, still allowing bacteria, the chance to adhere and colonizing the bladder symptoms of cystitis includes suprapubic pain, which is pain in the lower abdomen dysuria, which is painful or difficulty urinating as well as frequent urination and urgency. Meaning. You have to go a lot and you have to go now and typically the urine voids are small in volume.  Umm, having said that symptoms can differ by age. Infants, might have a fever become fussy and feed poorly. Whereas elderly patients, might feel fatigued, become incontinent or even develop dementia.  Symptoms that are not typically present with lower UTIs are systemic signs, like, fevers and nausea, or vomiting, as well as pain at the costovertebral angle, which is the angle formed on, either side of the back between the 12th, rib and the vertebral column.  If any of these do occur though, this might suggest an upper urinary tract infection, which includes an infection of the kidneys themselves.  If a urinalysis is done, there might be signs of inflammation, like, pyuria the presence of white blood cells in the urine which can make the urine appear cloudy. Having a couple white blood cells in the urine can be normal, but it'd be considered abnormally high. If there are more than five white blood cells per high-powered field on microscopy or more than ten white blood cells per milliliter on a hemocytometer.  Similarly, a dipstick test might show the presence of leukocyte esterase, which is an enzyme created by leukocytes or white blood cells.  It might also be positive for nitrites since gram negative organisms like E.coli convert nitrates in the urine to nitrites, but it's worth remembering that, not all Euro. Pathogens are able to do that.  All right, and finally, a urine culture is the gold standard for diagnosis and is considered positive. If it shows more than 100,000 colony-forming units per milliliter from a clean catch urine sample. Although a lower number of colony forming units, per ml might still indicate an infection depending on the source of the specimen in the specifics of the clinical scenario. And remember that this test assumes that the bacteria that grows is a known bacterial cause of UTIs and that the patient has clinical symptoms.  Now, if there's pyuria but the urine culture doesn't reveal a bacteria. This is known as sterile pyuria and it suggests urethritis inflammation of just the urethra as opposed to cystitis isolated. Urethritis is most commonly caused by nasteria, gonorrhea and chlamydia trachomatis. Both of which are sexually transmitted infections.  Free UTI Imaging studies can also be helpful. For example, a renal ultrasound can be used for children who might have a kidney malformation, which could contribute to developing a UTI in addition of voiding sister, urethra, G or vcug might be used, which is where someone's given a radio contrast liquid and fluoroscopy, which are like real-time X-rays. And then they watch all that fluid gets urinated out. And this is particularly helpful in children with severe, or recurrent UTIs to detect evidence of vesicle Euro.  Reflux, which is the retrograde movement of urine from the bladder, back up into the ureters, and kidneys. The degree of vesicle, urinal reflux, can vary and it's an important risk factor for kidney scarring with UTI.  Finally in some situations Reno scintigraphy, using dmsa, which is a radionuclide. Sometimes called a dmsa scan can be used to detect evidence of kidney scarring.  Treatment for a lower. UTI is usually antibiotics targeted to the bacterial cause and then those symptoms usually clear up within a few days as the urine becomes sterile. At the same time pain medication might also be given  Preventing UTIs, mainly involves drinking, lots of fluids to help flush out bacteria. That might try to ascend up the urethra and emptying the bladder as often as possible, which is especially relevant for women after sexual activity.  And finally, maintaining good hygiene, like wiping from the urethra to the rectum, all of which are aimed at preventing fecal bacteria, from making it up the urethra.  All right, has a quick recap cystitis, is inflammation of the bladder usually caused by bacterial infection, which makes it a type of lower urinary tract infection equalized by far the most, common culprit and risk factors include female, gender, sexual intercourse, having catheters, diabetes mellitus having penile foreskin and infant, boys, and urinary, stasis.

That you have an underactive thyroid about 4.6 percent of the United States population suffers from underactive thyroid, the risk for developing hypothyroidism is higher in women over age, 50 and postpartum. Females. Thyroid problems are easily identified with a simple blood test. And can often be fixed with the right medicines, but most cases of hypothyroidism remain undiagnosed because the early symptoms are diverse and easily ignored.  If you have multiple signs and symptoms of this problem, ask your doctor to check your thyroid hormone levels, here are the top ten signs that you have an underactive. Thyroid, one unexplained weight, gain weight, gain without any change, in diet or physical activity. May indicate low levels of thyroid hormones. These hormones help regulate basal metabolism and thermogenesis, as well as the metabolism of fats and glucose an underactive, thyroid contributes to a lower.  Metabolic rate, which may cause excess weight, gain a 2008 study published in the Saudi medical journal notes. That overall thyroid dysfunction was found more often in overweight people with varying degree of significance. However, more detailed studies are needed to find out the exact cause and effect relationship between obesity and hypothyroidism.

If you are following your usual Beauty, and skincare, regimen, and haven't change. Any of the products you use, but your skin is dry and itchy. It could be a symptom of hypothyroidism, the change in skin texture and appearance can be due to reduce blood circulation. One of the side effects of having low thyroid hormones. In addition, a slowed metabolism due to low thyroid hormone production can reduce sweating without proper sweating. The skin becomes dry and Flaky along.  With dry skin. There may be facial puffiness, especially near the eyelids and thickened skin on the lower legs with a pale or yellowish appearance.

       " 'KKF5yuxvg8': \"Diabetes mellitus and its Associated complications are the eighth leading cause of death worldwide. Now, normally we think of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes as being more chronic conditions that result in complications such as kidney disease and cardiovascular disease over a years to decades and this is true, but there are also a couple of very important acute complications of diabetes mellitus and these are known as diabetic.  Ketoacidosis or dka for short and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic non-ketotic state or hhns for short? And unfortunately, these acute complications can be very serious especially hhns which has a mortality rate of 8 to 20 percent in this video. Let's discuss hyperosmolar hyperglycemic non-ketotic State now the name hyperosmolar hyperglycemic non-ketotic state is  Pretty descriptive in regards to the metabolism that underlies the disease. However, it does not really describe the clinical presentation of the condition. So let's start with that and most commonly someone with hhns has already been diagnosed with diabetes and this occurs sometime after their initial diagnosis. And since they have diabetes, they likely will have hyperglycemia, which is one of the defining characteristics of diabetes mellitus.  And as we'll discuss in just a minute, it's this hyperglycemia that's driving a lot of the events that are occurring in hhns now over a period of days to weeks someone with hhns is going to become pretty sick and they're going to have symptoms of fatigue. Maybe some weight loss. They're going to have extreme thirst and frequent urination on physical exam. They'll have signs of dehydration such as a high heart rate known as tachycardia a low blood pressure known as hypotension.  They're the mucous membranes and their mouth may be dry and their skin may have decreased trigger meaning if you pinch the skin. It may kind of stick up like a tent and if it's severe enough the individual may have confusion or an altered mental status, but why exactly do all of these symptoms occur to get a better understanding let's break down the name hyperosmolar hyperglycemic non-ketotic State and then discuss some of the  Line metabolism and we're going to begin here with the hyperglycemia. Remember? Hhns is caused by diabetes and in diabetes. There's a deficiency of the hormone insulin in type 1 diabetes is deficiency is absolute. The pancreas is not able to produce the insulin, but in type 2 diabetes, the deficiency is relative. Meaning the body is not able to adequately respond to the insulin that is being produced by the pancreas. Now one of the  the functions of insulin is to pull glucose out of the blood to help store it in cells throughout the body such as the liver where it can then be used for energy later. Now in diabetes. This doesn't occur properly so glucose builds up in the blood resulting in hyperglycemia or high blood sugar and since the glucose cannot be used for energy. It can't be taken up. This is the reason for the fatigue or the decrease energy that someone with hhns  And because they have they're not able to use this energy. They may also have some weight loss.  Now this will lead us do the hyperosmolar component of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic non-ketotic state. So glucose is an osmotically active solute and this means that wherever it goes in the body water likes to follow. So in this diagram here, we have a blood vessel and some cells surrounding it now as the glucose levels in the blood will rise the water is pulled out of the cells in order to keep  The concentration of glucose in the blood at a relatively constant level. This is what I meant by osmotically active in that the water goes wherever the glucose goes. Now then as this blood moves to the kidneys where it's filtered under normal situations, the kidneys will filter out very little glucose. They reabsorb almost all of the glucose. It's in the blood. However at a certain point the hyperglycemia becomes so severe that the kid  Knees are not able to reabsorb all of the glucose and it spills out into the urine now just like before glucose is still osmotically active. So water then follows it out of the blood and into the urine. So this water is Flowing from cells and into the blood and then into the urine and from this process the body begins to lose a lot of water a lot of fluid very quickly. Now as the body loses all his water in the urine the concentration of the solutes.  The blood such as sodium potassium and glucose increases and this process which is ultimately caused by the high underlying hyperglycemia is known as Hyper osmolality or a high concentration of osmotically active solutes and the loss of fluid or the water all this water loss in the urine because of glucose or an osmotically active solute is known as osmotic diuresis and this is the reason for the intense thirst and frequent urination.  Nation in hhns as well as the severe dehydration and altered mental status. Now up to this point. You may be asking yourself. So what is the difference between diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic non-ketotic state and that would be a good question because so far there has not been a really a significant difference between the two. However, this is where the nonketotic portion of hhns becomes.  The differentiator so the vast majority of individuals with hyperosmolar hyperglycemic non-ketotic State have type 2 diabetes. This means that their pancreas has are still able to produce insulin. So the deficiency in the insulin is relative because this the pancreas is still producing insulin. It's just a cells throughout the body can't adequately respond to it. So how does this difference affect the underlying?  ISM well in both dka and hhns the body is in a state of Innocence starvation or starvation in the face of Plenty meaning that even though there's plenty of energy present in the blood in the form of glucose. The body is starving for energy because it can't utilize this energy and as such the body's metabolism responds as if it actually is starving and so one of the metabolic processes that occurs during starvation is a process known.  Is ketogenesis and as its name suggests, this is the process by which ketones or Ketone bodies are produced. So Genesis means the creation of and these ketones are produced from acetyl-coa, which is a byproduct of fat metabolism. However, these ketones or Ketone bodies. They also have a third name and that is keto acids and that's because they're acidic and so their production  in of all of these ketones or the ketogenesis results in a metabolic acidosis, hence the name diabetic ketoacidosis, however in hhns the individual has Type 2 diabetes as we stated and the insulin that is present acts to inhibit this ketogenesis pathway and therefore since insulin is present in hhns the creation of these Ketone bodies is  - to hence the name hyperosmolar hyperglycemic non-ketotic state. So now that we understand the physiology of the metabolism that underlies the clinical presentation of hhns let's use this knowledge to also understand how hhns can be treated now first off due to how severe hhns can become anyone with hhns or suspend you insist.  Expected of having hhns should really be treated in the Intensive Care Unit or the ICU of a hospital and there are two major treatments that need to occur. The first is the administration of IV or intravenous insulin. So the administration of insulin overcomes this underlying relative insulin deficit and therefore drives the glucose out of the bloodstream and into the cells throughout the body. So this is going to decrease  is the hyperglycemia which in return is going to decrease the osmotic diuresis and the fluid loss and the combination of those two things are going to decrease the hyperosmolarity of the blood and the second treatment is the aggressive rehydration with intravenous fluids such as normal saline and this replenishes the fluid loss that's caused by that osmotic diuresis and it also helps to decrease the  Osmolality now rehydration will help alleviate the signs of dehydration such as the tachycardia the hypotension is and the altered mental status. So as we mentioned earlier hyperosmolar, hyperglycemic non-ketotic state is a very serious and potentially even life-threatening complication of type 2 diabetes and as such any individual with type 2 diabetes who becomes very ill over a period of days two weeks should really be taken to the emergency.  A room immediately to be evaluated for HHS and if its present they need to be aggressively treated with IV insulin and fluid resuscitation to prevent the potentially fatal outcomes that are associated with hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic state.\",\n",

       " 'IMLVbEzM0DI': \"Type 2 diabetes receives a lot of attention in the lay press as a public health threat as it affects about ten percent of the global population and is currently the eighth most common cause of death worldwide as such understanding how to treat type 2 diabetes is very important because if its treated properly one can avoid nearly all of the complications of type 2 diabetes and live a happy and healthy life now before we dive into the specific treatments, let's first discuss the glucose regulation passed.  Pathway as it will help us to better understand the pharmacokinetics or the mechanisms of action for the different treatments of type 2 diabetes. Now in the center here is the blood glucose level and as blood glucose levels increase say after eating a meal. This is sensed by the pancreas and the beta cells within the pancreas secretes insulin, which acts on cells throughout the body to lower the blood glucose level then as blood glucose levels decrease. This is also sense by the pancreas and then the alpha cells  Create glucagon which acts to raise blood glucose levels and one of the mechanisms by which it does so is by promoting the conversion of glycogen to glucose in the liver, which is then released into the bloodstream now diabetes mellitus is a group of disorders that's caused by dysfunction of the insulin pathway resulting in an inability to lower blood glucose levels. And as you can see by this diagram, there are two main steps that must occur for this Pathway to work properly first in some must be secreted by the beta cells of the pancreas then  second the cells throughout the body must respond to insulin for it to have an effect and this glucose regulation pathway can be thought of as similar to that of the temperature regulation in a building. The thermostat is analogous to the pancreas and that it senses the changes in temperature and sends different signals accordingly. If the temperature increases then it sends a signal to the air conditioner to turn on which then lowers the temperature conversely if the temperature decreases this is also sensed by the  Thermostat and it sends a signal to the boiler and radiator to turn on which then raises the temperature now. Once again, there are two important steps. The thermostat must sense the change in temperature and send a signal which is similar to the first step in the insulin pathway. Then second the air conditioner must be able to act upon this signal in order to have an effect. So let's go back to our insulin pathway when we think of the types of diabetes in general. We think of type 1 diabetes as dysfunction of the first step and type  type 2 diabetes as occurring due to dysfunction of the Second Step. So it would make sense that the treatment of the different types of diabetes will be different as their underlying mechanisms are different in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Some medications are given to increase insulin secretion to help overcome the resistance and others are given to directly decrease the insulin resistance in the Second Step. So let's now discuss the specific treatments for type 2 diabetes and the mechanisms by which they work and we'll begin with lifestyle.  Vacations the first lifestyle intervention is that of proper nutrition and weight loss regardless of one's initial weight proper nutrition and Associated weight loss improves the body's ability to regulate blood glucose levels and proper nutrition for type 2 diabetes includes a well-balanced low calorie and low carbohydrate diet admittedly. This can be a very difficult change for many people with type 2 diabetes as it takes a great deal of dedication and self-control. However, it is extremely important because  a proper diet and weight loss have been shown to both increase insulin secretion and decrease insulin resistance. The other lifestyle modification is physical activity independent of weight loss increased physical activity has been shown to improve glycemic control through reducing insulin resistance and the benefits of exercise begin almost immediately. However, they can be short-lived if physical activity is not maintained persisting only about three to six days after the cessation of routine exercise.  So the recommendations for routine exercise include 30 minutes a day five days a week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity such as walking jogging or biking and the great thing about these lifestyle modifications as they don't just treat type 2 diabetes a proper diet and routine physical activity will also improve one's cardiovascular function lipid profile as well as their General mental well-being in addition to lifestyle modifications. There are many different medications available to treat type 2 diabetes. However, it can be confusing.  To keep them all straight instead of discussing each of the medications individually. Let's classify the different medications into groups based on their mechanism of action and how it relates to our diagram of glucose regulation and we'll start with a group of medications known as the big one Ides. And I know I just said we won't be discussing the individual medications. However, there is one exception and that is with metformin and this is because metformin is by far the most common big when I prescribe for type 2 diabetes and  Also the first line medication for the disease now metformin has three mechanisms of action that improve glucose regulation most importantly metformin directly increases the peripheral insulin sensitivity. It also acts by decreasing the action of glucagon in the liver. So instead of just augmenting the insulin pathway metformin also inhibits the opposing glucagon pathway, then lastly although not shown in this diagram metformin reduces intestinal absorption of glucose which then  Decreases the amount of glucose available to enter the bloodstream. Unfortunately metformin is also very effective on average metformin can reduce someone's hemoglobin A1c by about 1% However, it is important to note that individuals with liver failure cannot take metformin and a small percentage of individuals who take the medication will need to stop taking it due to an adverse side effect known as lactic acidosis. The next group of medications have a somewhat difficult name. They are the thiazolidinediones Ortiz Edie's.  Short similar to metformin tzd is also work to increase Type 2 Diabetes by acting on the second step to increase insulin sensitivity. However, the means by which they do so is different T CDs activate a receptor known as the paradoxes home proliferator activated receptor Gamma or ppar gamma for short and people are gamma is a transcription factor for multiple genes that increase insulin sensitivity in adipose muscle and liver cells as such by activating  NPR gamma T CDs indirectly increase insulin sensitivity. Now, the next group of medications is the sulfonylureas which are another common group of anti-diabetic medications. So fond of Korea's inhibit, the potassium channels on the beta cells within the pancreas and by inhibiting these channels potassium builds up within the cell and this depolarizes the cell membrane which opens voltage-gated calcium channels this causes an influx of calcium.  Into the beta cells which triggers the release of insulin into the bloodstream. So instead of decreasing insulin resistance sulfonylureas treat Type 2 Diabetes by overcoming the insulin resistance through increased insulin secretion. The last two groups of type 2 diabetes medications act upon the in cretan pathway and are therefore known as incretins and they are the glucagon-like peptide one or glp-1 agonists and the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 or DPP.  For antagonist incretins such as glp-1 or hormones that have to synergistic effects that result in the lowering of blood glucose levels first, they directly stimulate the release of insulin from the beta cells in the pancreas and second. They inhibit the release of glucagon dpp-4 on the other hand is an enzyme that inhibits the action of glp-1. Therefore glp-1 agonists can be given to directly stimulate this increment Pathway to  I meant the insulin pathway and treat type 2 diabetes similarly dpp-4 Inhibitors can be given to indirectly augment the insulin pathway by inhibiting the inhibition of the in cretan pathway. So it's important to note that any of the treatments for type 2 diabetes that act upon this first step in the insulin pathway and therefore increase insulin secretion will therefore also carry a risk of inducing hypoglycemia or low blood sugar levels and the treatments that act upon the step and  Carry, this risk include lifestyle modifications sulfonylureas and the incretins and one way to decrease this risk is to take the medications with a meal now. This is just an overview of the pharmacokinetics of the different interventions used to treat type 2 diabetes. And this is helpful for understanding how we can use medications to reverse and treat the underlying mechanisms that cause the disease however, just understanding the mechanisms does not convey a very practical approach to treating this disease.  For most individuals treating type 2 diabetes requires a combination of lifestyle modifications potentially multiple medications and routine Care by a primary care provider to achieve a happy and healthy life free of the complications of type 2 diabetes.\",\n",
       " 'IMPzAdVOhKY': \"This is the truth. I was working with Cory's brother and I saw this poster and said I want to go out to your sister. My name is Casey McClellan. I'm 40 years old and I was diagnosed with acromegaly in 2001 Sports is sort of always been What I've Done has an early infant young kid. I always had a ball in my hand and started to naturally navigate toward team sports and currently a referee college basketball and work for the Utah Summer Games. And so Cory and I were having a very normal. Newlywed life we were looking to start a family and that wasn't working out how we'd hoped and we're having a lot of difficulty. That's when Corey my wife was in dental hygiene school and started to study a study acromegaly. We were just briefly learning about different diseases different things that affect the job as my professor was going along saying all these symptoms signs and symptoms of acromegaly. I was just thinking my head but my word my husband has every one of those  my job was starting to change. I had a bite that the mouth guard that I used at night was no longer fitting which I thought I'd bent it and then my wedding ring was resized to different times. So after when I went home I said Casey I think you've got this disease that you've got every symptom of this disease. I thought she was nuts. I did indeed making a doctor appointment for Casey to go get his blood work done. But then when I went to my family doctor and told him Corey wants me to do my  Test for acromegaly she wasn't crazy. She was spot-on and I just looked back and said told you so.  So 26 years old the doctor basically diagnosed me with acromegaly any explain what the long-term diagnosis and treatment would be I went from doing very little medication or none to being overwhelmed with you're going to do multiple injections medications to make you healthy and in the beginning to be quite honest, it was a little overwhelming but now 15 years later 14 years later. It's routine. It's  That I've put into my daily routine and quite frankly. It's something that I don't really think twice about so actually do two injections one is a subcutaneous needle and my kids are very much involved with the process whether it be helping me mix the injection or the thing they really like to do is the alcohol swab rub it on my leg get ready for a little poke and instead of being scared and worried about it. They really embraced it. I also do a monthly injection. That is a 18 gauge needle and there's a lot of anxiety.  Leading up to that injection. I'm really fortunate that. I've got a great wife who has medical training being a dental hygienist who's able to help me with those injections, but I'm not gonna lie to you. There's some anxiety leading up to is this going to be the night where it hits the muscle funny. Is it going to bleed like crazy with acromegaly Sports has taught me to be a fighter and you know every day I get up and I'm excited that I get to have that day and compete and acromegaly is not going to get me down.

Now I want to emphasize that my perspective is coming from one with type 2 and not type 1. Our channel is primarily for those with pre-diabetes and type 2 today. I want to answer the question. What is the best glucose meter for type 2 diabetes?  After you watch the video today, I invite you to check out the description box for my new ebook. This is one of the most comprehensive diabetes meal planning books. You can find anywhere it contains, diabetes friendly meals and recipes recipes for different goals. Such as eight hundred, two 1800 calories per day meal plans, diabetes meal, planning tips and tricks. There are also tons of diabetes friendly recipes for everyone now,  Is really a difficult question to answer. And I mean, I have the brand of M. I use. I'm sure many of you do as well. And we probably all think ours is best, that makes sense. So, I wanted to remain as unbiased as possible for this video. So, my research led me to consumer search and an article by Lisa Maloney. This occurred in March of 2017. Now Maloney surveyed three, major studies of glucose meters from three.  A very reputable organizations Consumer Reports, diabetes, technology and Therapeutics and the Journal of diabetes Science and Technology. Now, each of these organizations did an independent study of 25 meters that were the leading sellers, each lab looked at several factors including accuracy, ease-of-use. No coding necessary, small sample size alternative site, testing.  Storage of readings data transfer capabilities, and the price of the test strips. Now, according to consumer search, the best M. It's the freestyle light. Now users love the freestyle light glucometer for its tiny size fast results and the equally tiny Point, 3 micro litre blood sample that it requires experts, love it for its excellence, repeatability, and accuracy in.  Trials. Now, other user friendly features that make this the top glucometer in our report includes. It's backlit screen and illuminated test report. No coding test strips great durability, and a 400 reading memory, that calculates a number of averages to help you spot Trends in your glucose readings. See, the freestyle light also has a data Port that lets you download your readings into a Windows or OS X.  Using freestyles, auto assist desktop program. Now the program compiles, several types of reports including meter readings Mill event, averages daily stats and a snapshot report. Finally, as Tiny, as it may be users, have only good things to say about the freestyle lights durability. Some reviewers have been using the same meter for years with no problem. What initially look like complaints about the meter often turned out to be unhappiness.  With just the Lancing device users, don't like that. It requires you to change the Lansing. Needles manually, the unit itself about 25 bucks. The freestyle lights test strips about 30 dollars for a pack of 50 are a bit on the pricey side, but Abbott which manufactures the freestyle light offers a copay program that limits your payments to as little as fifteen dollars per box of 50 strips if you qualify. Now, I did look at  Best affordable blood, glucose meter in the study and it was the bear Contour Next. The inexpensive bear Contour. Next excelled in a clinical trial and packs features that are very rare in this price range, including programmable reminders and the ability to add notes or meal tags to readings users. Especially, love that. You can apply blood to the Contour. Next test strips from almost any angle. And if you don't provide the  a full point 6, micro liter sample on the first try, you do have up to 30 seconds to add more blood to the strip. That way, you don't ruin it. This meter actually ranked third in two of the lab reports and fourth overall. Now, you can get this M for as little as 12 bucks and a box of 50 test strips about 11 bucks with coupons and discounts available. It's my personal opinion that this is really the best from my research for most of us with  Diabetes. And no, it's not the one I use, and I'm not getting any money from anyone.

       " 'IpedthIpUnY': \"Board. But insulin resistance is something a little different because it basically, as insulin connects into the cell, the cell doesn't absorb it anymore. It blocks it. So on the other side of the cell you have low insulin, or low effects of insulin. So here you have the cells that are starving of food in nutrition in energy and glucose yet. You have all this sugar piling up in the blood. So you've it's going to send signals back around to jack up the insulin, so insulin  People with insulin resistance have five to seven times more insulin than normal people. And so many people have insulin resistance. They don't even know they have. It takes 10 years to develop. It causes a stubborn belly fat. It creates problems with a fatty liver and then having fatty liver actually causes insulin resistance. So it's one big ugly cycle. So some of the symptoms are tired after you eat lunch or a dinner. Not satisfied after you eat craving for  Is a big one, basically, high blood pressure, fluid retention. These are all symptoms of insulin resistance. Okay, does that help? That was amazing? That was amazing. That was a very good explanation of insulin resistance. Thank you. There are gurus out there that are just pushing this avoidance of saturated fats. I want to show you one right here. Joslin, Diabetes Center. Now, if you look at one section of their website, they have the  The five myths. Okay, and this is just totally bogus information. I'm going to have my buddy. Just explain and share these Miss with you. So would you just go ahead and show them these Miss? Sure. No problem.  So we had the five common myths for people with diabetes debunked. Okay. This is actually ridiculous. People diabetes have to eat different foods from the rest of the family. Right people. Diabetes can eat the same Foods as the rest of the family. That's what they're recommending. That is crazy. What if they're eating sugar? You're getting the same thing?  Bad bad advice. Here's another myth people with diabetes. Should never give in to food cravings. Okay, they're calling that a myth. All right, this is right here. If you crave. If a craving does occur, let yourself have a small taste of whatever it is, you want in doing. So, you'll enjoy the flavor and avoid overeating later on. Bad advice. This is, this is as bad as eating everything in moderation because as soon as you start eating something, you are going to want it more in craving a  Is going to spike the sugar and drop it. The point is that the definition of fat is something to protect you against the starvation of sugar. This doesn't starve you sugar. It gives you a little bit through the day. I just enough to block any chance of losing weight. You have to be able to lose weight. You have to literally drop sugars way way, way, way down there, especially if it slowed metabolism because just the nature, you're not going to make the switch to fat burning. If you do that, if you don't do that, so  Bad advice number three, people with diabetes shouldn't eat too many starchy Foods, even if they contain fiber because starch raises your blood glucose and makes you gain weight. They're calling that a myth.  Starchy foods such as bread, pasta rice, cereal, provide carbohydrate the body's energy source, that's not true. The body can run on ketones, which is a different fuel source from fat fruit milk. Yogurt, in deserts contain carbohydrates as well. Everyone needs some carbohydrates in their diet. No, they don't even people with diabetes, people die by diabetics, have too much sugar in their blood. Okay.  So they don't need to add more sugar in their diet, to stimulate the insulin weight weight gain occurs. When you take in more calories than you burn off here. This is one of the oldest crappiest lies. They keep pushing this, this is not true. It's been proven to be an utter failure. Number four, people, diabetes do not have to worry about eating fats because it doesn't have much effect on the blood. Glucose are calling that a myth.  Fat found in margarine oil salad dressings, have a little intermediate effect on blood glucose levels. However, eating a fatty meal can slow down digestion and make it harder for your insulin to work causing a possible high. Glucose level levels hours after a meal. Again, this that's not the reason. The reason is fats are neutral fats, are neutral and he's going to show you that in the next part. So you don't have to worry about  Eating fat fat doesn't increase glucose sugar does if you combine them, that's really deadly. Okay, so  Yeah, that's all. That's all I'm saying. Now. I'm going to zip a.com over to you. Well, thank you. Appreciate that. There are gurus out there that will tell you, that Sugar doesn't cause insulin resistance, or even diabetes. So, check out this clip right here. It's a myth that Sugar causes diabetes. Many people think that the consumption of high carbohydrate Foods or foods high in sugar are the cause of diabetes. It's easy to think that high blood sugar is caused by sugar. This is so not true. Sure.  It does cause diabetes. Check out this clip. What causes insulin resistance? It's intra Mi celular lipid. It's fat that's inside the muscle fibers. It interferes with insulin signaling such that your body has to keep pumping in some, to try to force it into your muscles, which use about 85% of the, your blood sugar, your blood sugar's rise because they can't enter into the cells and not just any fat, but particularly sad.  Serrated fat is toxic. So it actually, this is called lipo toxicity. Interesting. I will check out one more clip. All fats don't affect muscles. The same, the type of fat saturated versus unsaturated is critical saturated fats, like palmitate found, mostly meat Dairy eggs, cause insulin resistance, but all the gate from oh, saying that solves, avocados. May actually improve insulin sensitivity. You see, this is why it's so frustrating because you're getting conflicting information. One doctor says eat.  The other doctor said avoid fat. It's confirm, massive confusion. This is why I drink on the weekends now, I don't drink on the weekends. It's going to increase my sugar basically. So here's the point. The point is you need to be able to understand what the actual research really says. And for that, I'm going to bring on my buddy over here, that's going to go over the research, just so you can see yourself what the truth is over to you. I'll help you out.  Okay, so we got here, some some research articles that show the relationship of a low-carbohydrate diet compared to a low-fat diet. This is from the New England Journal of Medicine. This is what it says right here. It says, severely obese subjects with a high prevalence of diabetes or the metabolic syndrome lost more weight during 6 months on a carbohydrate restricted diet, then on a calorie or a fad restrictive.  Diet, okay, with relative Improvement in insulin sensitivity. So in this study there showing that having some fat and low carbs is a good thing for your blood sugar's. Okay. That's what it's saying. But of course, people ignore that. Okay, here's another one Beyond weight loss. A review of the therapeutic uses of a very low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet. See, ketogenic is more of a diet where you involving adding a lot more.  Fat to the diet, but you have to keep the sugar is really low. It says right here, very low carbohydrate. Diets are ketogenic diets have been used since the 1920s recent work over, the last decade has provided evidence of the therapeutic potential of ketogenic diets. In many conditions, such as diabetes, and even other two, other ones to polycystic ovarian syndrome, acne neurological disease, cancer, respiratory cardiovascular.  I mean, come on. These are research articles that show that saturated fats are not that bad. Okay, that are actually therapeutic in nature. Here's one, the American journal of clinical nutrition, long-term effects of a very low carbohydrate loss diet, compared with an ISO calorie low fat diet. Yeah, and here's another one, the effects of a low carbohydrate versus conventional weight loss diet. In severe obesity, dolts a one-year follow-up of randomized, trial. It's basically showing us that fad diets are not  The culprit. Okay. So this is research that just proves that and what we want to do is we don't want to be afraid of fat. Okay, so over to you, my friend. Wow, that's amazing. Do you realize they were really only seven studies that were done on this topic and out of the seven, only one one study showed a weak relationship. It was called Almost statistically significant.  That mean almost is not always almost is sort of, but not really. So all Six studies showed that there was no no influence, or no effect on your blood sugars by eating saturated fats, but they ignored those. Okay. So, really these theories are based on one, very weak study that they're using. As the reason to get the mass, the population off of the fats, and this makes sugar.  Okay, to eat. So you keep eating the sugar, you keep eating the sugar and you never get better, but you still take your medication. There's something else called the insulin indexer, certain research, that was done to. Look at the relationship between non carbohydrate, things that stimulate insulin. And the thing that I want to bring up on the insulin index is that fats are low on the list, which means they're almost neutral. They don't affect insulin unless you had trigger, but if you're just having a pure fat,  they buffer insulin. Because if you were to take a low fat, High concentrated, whey protein, mix. That is a high insulin Spike, by the way, and you took an egg, which has yolk and egg white. The yolk buffers, the egg white, it makes it smaller in the reaction to insulin. So fats this whole time have been totally okay to consume. In fact necessary, if you have a pre-diabetic state,  Why? Because allows you to go longer without eating. So if you're not eating, you drop insulin down and you can actually\",\n",

This is why it is called a silent disease. People often ignore the warning signs of pancreatic cancer until the problem becomes severe. It is important to be aware of these signs as addressing. The problem. Early can save you from future complications. If you  Multiple signs and symptoms of this problem, ask your doctor to check your health levels. Here are the early warning signs of pancreatic cancer that you must know.  One jaundice. It is common for people with pancreatic cancer to experience jaundice, characterized by yellowing of the eyes or skin. Jaundice can also cause itchiness on the hands and feet, especially the palms and Soles any size of tumor located in the head of the pancreas can lead to irregular bowel a yellowish Brown. Fluid released by your liver to Aid digestion. Flowing from the gallbladder into the small intestine. This causes excess buildup of bilirubin in the blood.  One of the main causes of jaundice, if you have signs of jaundice consult your doctor as it is, a common symptom of many liver and gallbladder diseases, as well as a sign of pancreatic cancer. If other causes are rolled out, ask your doctor about testing for pancreatic cancer, before we continue this video. Do not forget to subscribe my channel to see other useful health videos to abdominal and lower back, pain abdominal as well as back. Pain are also common.  Eames in patients with pancreatic cancer. Usually the sharp pain is felt in the upper abdomen, which gradually radiates toward the back. Many patients also report. The pain is more severe at night and that they get slight relief from the Pain by bending forward. A 2001 study published in a pancreas Journal found that abdominal pain and pancreatic cancer patients can be due to the increasing size of the tumor invasion of the intra pancreatic nerves invasion of the anterior, pancreatic capsule and limb.  Node metastasis. If you are experiencing persistent mild to moderate abdominal pain. Consult a doctor, most cases of pancreatic cancer are diagnosed in patients, visiting the emergency room complaining of severe abdominal pain. In fact, the location of the pain is helpful in determining where tumor is located.  Three, nausea and vomiting. Nausea followed by vomiting is another sign of pancreatic cancer as the tumor goes. It can block some portions of the digestive tract which a the overall digestion process along with nausea. And vomiting. You may also experience heartburn and acid reflux as any kind of interference with normal, digestion, and excretion processes can cause vomiting all nausea. And vomiting episodes are not necessarily linked with  Sir, try peppermint or ginger tea, as well as limiting your water intake with meals, but drink water between meals to reduce nausea. If these symptoms tend to worsen after eating, and it is becoming difficult for you to eat anything without throwing up.

Unexplained weight loss is another  Noticeable warning, sign of different types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer weight loss often occurs when a tumor Sprint's to nearby organs and impairs their functioning. This affects proper digestion of nutrients and also leads to poor appetite. Also, due to lack of pancreatic enzymes aiding digestion. Dietary fat start passing through the body undigested, which in turn causes weight loss. Furthermore, the cancer cells compete with healthy cells for nutrients.  If you have started losing weight suddenly without making, any changes to your diet or physical activity, consult your doctor, 5 greasy or light-colored stool, stools of people suffering from pancreatic cancer, have some distinct characteristics. The stools may become large pale, oily floating, and smelly, as the growing tumor prevents the pancreas from releasing its digestive enzymes. These enzymes are needed to digest food, especially  Fatty food, the undigested fat ultimately ends up in your stool, making it float or look Rishi. These fatty stools are difficult to flush away.

       " 'ItE86GxFwWk': \"A study published in the Lancet, a leading international medical journal. In August 2014 found that the risk of developing diabetes is increasingly rapidly among Americans. The study also found that this risk depends on your race, your education, and where you live, and that diabetics are living longer. This study is the first in more than a decade to calculate the risk Americans face of developing diabetes. During their lifetime, it was conducted by epidemiologists at the US Centers for Disease Control and prevention in Atlanta, Georgia who have been tracking and analyzing the prevalence of diabetes. And the rate at which news cases are diagnosed for many years, these researchers use mortality data for almost six hundred thousand persons from 1985 to 2011, 25 years to assess the risk of  Whipping type 1 or type 2 diabetes, excluding gestational diabetes though, the study only examined diabetes in the context of American people. It is likely that similar results would have been obtained. Had the study been conducted using European data or data from other countries where Western type diet and lifestyle is the norm the ever increasing risk of diabetes. The study revealed that there was a dramatic rise between 1985  Five and Twenty eleven in the overall risk. That an American will develop diabetes in 1985, American boys, had a 21 percent chance of developing diabetes, and girls 27% by 2011. However, that risk had jumped to 40% for both boys and girls. In other words, the risk for boys had almost doubled while the risk for girls had gone.  Up. 50% the Lancet study did not analyze white. This is so, but part of the reason could be the fact that people are living longer so that they have more years during which they can develop, diabetes diabetics are living longer. The good news, is that America children diagnosed with diabetes? Can't now expect to live more than 70 years with the disease, indeed between 1985 and 2011. The number  Number of years for which meant diagnosed with diabetes, can expect to survive the increased by one hundred. Fifty six percent for women. The figure was 70% though. No explanation was given by the researchers. This is probably due to advances in medical knowledge and treatments over the last 25 years. Being diabetic shortens your life span over the 25 year period examined by the  Searchers the average number of years lost due to diabetes for the population, as a whole increased by forty six percent, in men and 44 percent in women. This is obviously due to the increasing prevalence of diabetes. It may also be partly due to the fact that there are probably fewer undiagnosed cases. Nowadays, while the picture for the population as a whole, seems to be getting Bleaker things are improving for the individual diabetic.  The number of years of his life. A man diagnosed with diabetes can expect to lose on average decreased by almost two years from 7.7. 25.8 Lost Years between the 1990s and the end of the 2000s. Women also gained an average of two years, their losses decreasing from eight point seven to six point. Eight years silver. The same time. Span. These improvements are probably due to better.  Regimes race, gender, and diabetes. While Americans overall have a gloomy, 40 percent chance of developing diabetes. The outlook for blacks and Hispanics is much Grimmer. White boys, have a 37% and white girls of 34 percent risk of developing Diabetes, by contrast. The chances for black men are 44.7% while for their sisters. The risk is a whopping 55 points.  3%, the chances of developing diabetes for Hispanic boys and girls are 51.8% and 51.5% respectively. These figures which refer to the risks of developing diabetes. Reinforce. The idea that diabetes has a genetic origin. At least to the extent that your genes can predispose you to diabeetus most medical researchers. Agree that it's yours.  Lifestyle that kicks it into action. According to the researchers. They act analyzed race because that was the data they had available, but they did state. That socioeconomic status is probably as important as if not more important than Grace. Nevertheless, the risk of developing diabetes for whites is much less than it is for blacks and Hispanics. Indeed. The risk for white girls is a third less than the  Ask for Black and Hispanic Ladies. As you can see, Hispanics of both sexes, as well as black women, have a risk that exceeds 50%. But why black men have a risk that is almost 10 percentage points less than black. Women cannot be explained Away by genetic differences, education and diabetes. The less educated. You are, the greater your risk of developing diabetes. According to the Lancet.  It in 1990. The number of new diagnoses among High School dropouts was 6.5% thousand while among high school graduates. It was 3.6. And for those who studied Beyond High School, 3.2 per thousand, this figure for the number of new diagnosis of diabetes among High School dropouts, high school graduates, and those who continued to study After High School has been increasing steadily.  In 2008, it peaked at fifteen point six, nine point four and six point five per thousand respectively. Since then the rate at which new diagnoses are being discovered has dropped off a bit. This may be due to improving Lifestyles at the same time. According to the latest statistics, High School dropouts are likely on average to develop diabetes at about twice. The rate of persons. Who  Continued their education after graduating from high school. It seems likely that the more educated you are, the more likely you are to live a healthy lifestyle and to take the threat of diabetes. Seriously where you live and diabetus, the risk of developing diabetes, also seems to vary from state to state in the USA. In Mississippi. For example, eleven point seven percent of the population have diabetes.  In Louisiana, the figure is 11.5% in South Dakota and Hawaii by contrast. Only 7% of the population aren't diabetic. The percentage of people with diabetes in the other states of the Union is between these two extremes of 72 11.7%. What accounts for these differences is not known though. It's probably a mixture of Education food cultures.  Sir, sighs habits and genetics. Climate might also play a part though. This has not been investigated. As far as I am. Aware the takeaway continuing increases in the numbers of new cases of diabetes diagnosed each year combined with longer. Lifespans have led to increases in the risk of developing diabetes. And in the number of years spent cooking, when the disease at the same time, the average individual is losing fewer years.  Ears from his lifespan due to the disease, these findings of the Lancet study mean, that there will be a continued need for health services and extensive funding to manage the disease. They also emphasized the need for Effective interventions to reduce the incidence of diabetes, such as education, and Healthy Lifestyles and regular testing of the entire population to detect.

       " '2ZO0n8': \"Hey, dr. Burke here. I'm going to talk about insulin resistance. I'm going to make it really, really simple. So just track with me. Here is what happens your pancreas, which is located on the left lower quadrant, right by your rib cage makes  A hormone called insulin and Insulin responds to sugar. In other words, it triggered by sugar or anything that turns into sugar. So anything sweet anything that might even refined grains can trigger insulin and it kicks in there and it goes into your cells. And then what it does, is it removes the sugar from your blood? Okay. So that's the purpose is to lower the sugar. All right? Normally in our blood, we need about.  100 milligrams per deciliter. And basically it means is you just think focus on the 100. So when you get your sugar test in your blood should be like a 100, the goal is to make it 100. Anything higher is bad. Anything lowers bad. We need a 100, what it's at 100. You're at your mental best. You're feeling the best but when it goes High you get, what's called diabetes. So diabetes is a high sugar situation. When the blood sugar is go low. That's hypo sugar or hypoglycemia.  I see Mia. Okay, that's kind of a pre-diabetes state. So when I was 12, I had hypoglycemia. I remember skipping a meal and feeling really dizzy and irritable and cranky playing outside and like, I don't know what it was. But of course, I was living on pure sugar. I would raid the cupboards and eat pure sugar all the time. So that's really what causes hypoglycemia is because what happens is you, you eat all this sugar and we get this hyper reactive.  High insulin state, which is going to, it's going to like, take a sledgehammer and push that sugar right down. So we're going to upload sugar, irritable cranky, craving, dizzy, all those things. Okay. So now what happens over a period of time when your hypoglycemic over a period of time? Your body doesn't like that. So it's going to say stop. So it's going to try to protect itself and it's going to turn off the receptor, receive the thing that receives. So it's going to ignore that.  That insulin response. So it's not going to receive it anymore. Someone's talking, but no one's listening, and that's called a downgrade or a blocked receptor. So, it doesn't receive as much as it did before, and that's what insulin resistance is, because it's your body, your cells are resistant. It's inhibiting this absorption because it's saying, dude, why you keep eating sugar. Would you please stop? And what happens when this happens? Is it forces insulin to go?  Higher, because it's compensating. It's not a feedback loop here. So insulin resistance forces your body to make more insulin to create the same effect because without this insulin, the sugar stays high and your body does not like that. So it has to lower it somehow so it's just going to it's going to wear the pink rias out. All right. So diabetes is really a situation where you have high sugar and it won't come down to 100. All right, we already  He passed the hypoglycemia thing. We're done type 2, diabetes, is insulin resistance. And because the because of the, you've been eating too much sugar and when this becomes like that, your body protects you and several things happen, as a consequence, in addition to jacking up more insulin. Number two, you're going to be hungry. Why? Because insulin has a few other purposes. It not only lowers the sugar in your blood.  But it also helps you absorb the nutrition in your cells. So the nutrients of fatty acids, proteins vitamins, so without insulin, you can't get the nutrition in your cells. So guess what? You're going to, you're going to be hungry all the time. You're not going to be satisfied, you eat, but it doesn't really go in. So, you have this fat person that starving to death. You can't get healthy like that. And then also, you're going to crave carbs, like crazy, and just so, you know,  If you're craving carbs or sweets, it is literally impossible to burn fat. So every time that you're craving, you're not burning any fat. Don't worry. I'll show you how to fix that. So we got Cravings, hunger and decrease nutrition. And that's why over a period of time, diabetics end up with all sorts of health problems. They go blind, they get their feet start getting they destructive nerves. So it's called peripheral neuropathy. They get tingling in the feet and the hands, and they just kind of go downhill and then also,  Also, this condition is going to prevent the storage of sugars called glycogen which basically is the stored sugar in your liver and your muscles. So we need that to live off of when we're sleeping between meals. And so if we can't store the sugar as much anymore, what happens is we end up having all sorts of problems of storing more fat for not storing sugar. We have to store more fat. So you're going to keep  And fatter and fatter and fatter and also in between the males because you can't have a storage of sugar, you're going to have too many highs and too many low. So it's going to come up and down too much. It's the storage of that sugar, that maintains a nice level sugar. So an especially noted when you get up in the morning, after not eating 48 Hours. Okay, so there's a couple things I want to cover.  Let's go back to this sugar. We need 100 milligrams per deciliter that would equal about five grams of sugar. That's like a heaping teaspoon of sugar in your in your entire body on an average person. They only need a teaspoon of sugar but not consuming sugar. But from the food that converts to the sugar even protein and fat can convert to sugar. So we need about 1 teaspoon of sugar. We don't need more than that. But check this out, an 8 ounce.  Typical can of soda and 8 oz. Typical glass of orange juice, is about thirty nine teaspoons of sugar. Okay. So now we want from five to thirty nine. That's a tremendous stress on the pancreas. Oh my gosh, what you're doing is you're just wearing the thing out. It's creating Whiplash of your pancreas. And because the pancreas has two parts, one is a hormone part.  And the other is an enzyme part called the exocrine gland. You're going to start having all sorts of digestive problems, including possible, pancreatitis, inflammation of the pancreas tension in your upper digestive system bloating for sure, maybe even pain that goes around your back. Undigested proteins. You can't digest protein anymore.  All sorts of bowel problems. I mean, you name it, you're going to its creates a lot of problems now, so the body is trying to protect itself from too much insulin. So it's going to block the resistance that the receptor create more resistance in there. And then the sugar is going to go high. So apparently the body is going to protect the cell and not necessarily the blood. So that's why the Blood starts filling up with sugar and that's where you get  All this extra fat and triglycerides and cholesterol. In other words, triglycerides are blood fats. And because the cell can't absorb nutrition anymore or protein or fat. It's going to dump around the rest of the body. As in the blood is blood fats, adipose tissue and cholesterol. Those are the effects of this situation. So we got this hypoglycemia thing, right? Which is high sugar and then  The receptor becomes resistant, so it doesn't absorb it anymore. That's type 2 diabetes. That creates all sorts of problems, and then down the road, you end up with diabetes type 1 and type 1. The pancreas is already asleep. Okay, it can't produce this anymore. So now you have to be injected because the sugars are going higher, and higher, and higher and higher, and your insulin can't keep up to lower them. And yes, there are other causes of Diabetes Type 1.  Autoimmune. But the question is, what causes autoimmune that's in another video. The point is that type 1 diabetes is the worst situation because now you've completely ran out of this whole situation and now you have to be injected or take insulin. So what do we do about this? What can be done? Well, there's a couple things you can do. And number one. We need to lower. Insulin. Okay. We need to lower in some.  Has to be a primary goal, doctors, do not emphasize this enough. What they do is they give you insulin, they don't put enough attention on the diet. They don't realize that in a diabetic situation in a hypoglycemic situation. If the person is craving, they should not be consuming any sugars zero.  Don't give the person recommendations like everything in moderation. That would be very bad. We zero sugars. They can do substitute sugars like Xylitol Stevia, but they can't afford to continue to eat more sugar or juice. So number one. We avoid things that trigger insulin and then we also can increase other things to primarily potassium. Why? Because potassium will help lower insulin help you store.  Trigger and you want to get it from the food. So you would need to consume at least 7 to 10 cups of vegetable or the Cal Shake I recommend because it has all the potassium in it. You can make it. I show you how to my website and make that seven to 10 cups of vegetable to get your potassium. That will also really help Cravings because it's going to lower insulin. Number two, you want to increase vitamin B1, but really the other B complex vitamins, too, but I recommend getting this.  This not from a pill, but from nutritional yeast. Why? Because nutritional yeast is a great form of natural B vitamins. That will greatly assist in lowering insulin. Why? Because when you, when you consume all the sugar, you're actually dumping all your B vitamins in your potassium, out through the urine up to 15 times more than if you didn't have this problem. So you're losing all this and don't worry consuming.  Nutritional yeast, won't give you a yeast infection. All right, then. The last thing I want to recommend would be protein because protein is a nutrient in its block from the cell. You're probably going to be deficient in protein. So you need to have protein especially for breakfast. Okay, that's very important because if you don't then at the end of the day your blood sugars are going to be so far off that you're going to need the need for insulin or end medications going to be much much greater. Okay, so  I hope I helped you understand this and one last point.  Insulin stops fat burning in the presence of insulin. You will not burn fat. So what is the goal is to lower insulin and to a normal level. Hope this helped see you in the next video.\",\n",

       " 'J0Y1MlanzCk': \"If it's humoral immunity, we will always be working with B lymphocytes.  Cell mediated immunity. On the other hand, you will always be dealing with t lymphocytes. So these two different types of immunity involve lymphocytes. However, however, they involve different types of lymphocytes. So what we're going to be doing first, is looking at characteristics for these lymphocytes before we get into the process of how they actually function as part of the immune system.  So first off, let's look at the origin for the B and the T cells. And so in chapter 15, which was on the blood, we talked about how various blood cells are produced through precursor stem cell or a him hemopoietic precursor cell. And we talked about how those can give rise to red blood cells platelets. Monocytes, granulocytes and so on. But now what our focus is going to be on is how those hematopoietic stem cells are precursor cells.  Become lymphoid, stem cells. And then those lymphoid stem cells become lymphocytes, and that occurs in the bone marrow. So, once we have these lymphocytes, then they can start differentiating. And this is where they can differentiate into B into T lymphocytes. So, first, let's focus on the B lymphocytes. The B lymphocytes. They're pretty straightforward in the sense that they're going to differentiate and mature in the  Arrow. Once they mature into these B cells, then the B cells are going to move into the peripheral lymphoid tissues. And when they move into the peripheral lymphoid tissues, we're talking about them moving into the spleen peyer's, patches lymph nodes and tousle tonsils. Just to give you an example of some of your peripheral lymphoid, tissues. Once. The B cells, invade these lymphoid tissues. They're going to hang out. They're going to  Stay in that area and they're just going to veg there. Okay, so once they're there, they're waiting and what they're waiting for is an invasion by some foreign.  Component. So, once there's an invasion, let's say it could be a bacterial Invasion. For example, the B cells, then leave the peripheral lymphoid, tissues. Not all of them at once are going to leave. You'll always have some left behind, but once those some of those B cells have left, what they're going to do then is they're going to mount.  What's called an antibody mediated immune response? So right away, you need to link B cells and the fact that they're going to mount or cause in other words, an antibody mediated immune response. Now, the T cells work, a little differently. So what T cells are going to do T-cells, you actually have the immature. T cells that are going to leave the bone marrow and when the immature T cells, leave the bone marrow they're going.  Go to the thymus.  And if you recall, we briefly mentioned the thymus when we talked about hormones and we talked about one hormone in particular that suppresses the thymus. And if you recall that hormone was what,  The hormone that suppresses the thymus is cortisol. Okay. So what's going on in the thymus then when these immature T cells arrive in the thymus, they get trained and tested before they're able to leave. So what I mean by training and testing them, I'm going to come off over here to the left a little bit and here's the thymus. So what we're going to do is we're going to take some T cells. So we've got a t lymphocyte which is the same thing as just saying.  T Cell T lymphocyte and tea seller, the same thing. We're going to present this T Cell on this side with what's called a non self. Sell another words. It's a cell that's not part of the body. So the T cells should recognize that non-self cells as foreign. And if the T-cell rep recognizes that non-self cells as foreign, then it should kill the  Self sell. It should attack it.  If it attacks and kills that non-self cell, then the T-cell graduates.  It's pants. It's test. Alright, so if it graduates then it gets to move on to the peripheral lymphoid tissues. All right, and if it gets to go to into the peripheral lymphoid tissues, it's going to do with the B cells. Do it's going to hang out there and it's gonna wait for a foreign Invasion. Once that occurs T cells will move out of the lymphoid tissues.  And they're going to mount What's called the cell mediated. Immune response will talk, more in more detail about that cell. Mediated immune response. And as well as the antibody mediated responses later. Now, let's go back to the thymus again because the T-cell like I said earlier, is presented with a non self, sell the T cell.  Can also be presented with a self cell. So what I mean by a self salads, this has to be is cell. That is normally found within the body. So should the T-cell kill it.  The answer is no, you do not want a T-cell killing self cells because then you would have an autoimmune disease. So when the T-cell is presented, the self sell, it should not kill the self cell.  And if it does not kill the self cell, guess what? It gets to graduate and it moves on to the peripheral lymphoid, tissues. Okay, but here's the issue.  Let's say when the T-cell is presented with the self, sell it kills the self cell. Is that a good thing or a bad thing?  Okay, that's a bad thing. Right? Because now you would have an autoimmune disease. So should the T-cell graduate, should it be able to leave the thymus and enter into the peripheral lymphoid tissues? Would that be a good idea? The answer is, no. You don't want to T-cell now circulating throughout your body that's killing self cells. You would be in real trouble if that would happen. So what should happen now to that T-cell, the T cell is going to commit suicide. So, the T Cell, undergoes, a  Pop ptosis. So this is programmed, cell death, and you should have learned about program cell death in your introductory, biology course. Now, if you haven't, that's not a problem. Just remember, that apoptosis is programmed, cell death. So that T cell dies, it commits suicide, and it should because if it doesn't, you will have an autoimmune disease. Okay. So what we have then is the thymus training and testing the T cells.  The thymus trains and tests T cells if the T-cells passed the test. So they graduate, then they get to move on to the peripheral lymphoid tissues peripheral lymphoid tissues, and then they get to leave those whenever there's a foreign Invasion, and then they will mount a cell mediated immune response. All right. So those are the origins for your being your T cells.  Now what this table does here for you guys is it's going to compare your B and t-lymphocytes in the in the left-hand column you have characteristics for each of the B and the T lymphocytes. So we're going to actually be going through each one of these. So you may want to expand on this table and use it as a study guide. I think it'd be a nice comparison for you.  All right. So before we go any further, we need to talk about antibodies and antigens. So the first question is well, what is an antigen? An antigen is a foreign molecule or an abnormal cell. So let's expand on that before we go any further. So if we say an antigen is a foreign molecule, that could be a protein, could be a polysaccharide.  And these are protein or polysaccharide components of a foreign cell. Okay. So these are foreign molecules proteins, polysaccharides that are components of some sort of foreign.  Sell.  All right. Now, what we mean by of some foreign cell, you can think about the foreign cell as being a virus. You could think about it as being a bacteria. You could think about this as being a let's see fungus approach East a parasitic worm.  Those are just to give you a few examples of foreign cells and what we're talking about here. Now, abnormal cells, on the other hand. We may be referring to a tumor cell because a tumor cell would be considered an abnormal cell or it could even be a transplanted cell.  So, if you've had a organ transplant.  It comes with cells, right? So transplanted cells, would be considered abnormal because they're not normally found in your body. Now, regardless of whether, or not your antigen, is this foreign molecule or it's an abnormal cell, they all contain, what's called an epitope.  So epitopes are recognition sites, which are called antigenic determinants. So if you look at the diagram on the right, here's the antigen that's the cell, the epitopes here are on the cell surface. So the epitope is what binds to the antibody. So you can see the epitope here and then you can see it binding to the antibody. And when it binds to the antibody, that's going to trigger an immune response. So let's take a look at  Properties of an antibody. So antibodies are all y-shaped and you can see the image here at the, on the right hand, side of your screen for the y-shaped antibody and you have four interlinked polypeptide chains. So when you look at these, there's too heavy and long chains. There's two short and light chains. They have variable and constant regions, which really important is that when you look at where the antigen binding site is located, that's on the end.  End with the variable.\",\n",

I want to talk to you about whether or not you need diabetes medication after you watch the video. Today. I invite you to check out the description box for my new ebook. This is one of the most comprehensive diabetes meal planning books. You'll find anywhere it contains. Diabetes friendly meals and recipes recipes for different goals, such as 800 to. 1,800 calories per day meal plan, diabetes meal, planning tips and tricks. And there are also tons of diabetes, friendly recipes for everyone. Now, the answer, this question, really depends on several factors. The first of which is what type of Diabetes do you have? So, let's first breakdown, type 1 and type 2 type 1, diabetes. Well, if you have that then you are insulin-dependent. If you have type 1 then approximately 90% of  your insulin producing cells have been destroyed and sadly the process that destroyed the 90% of insulin producing cells will destroy the remaining. 10%, Ultimately, you will be totally dependent on insulin type 1. Diabetes cannot be managed without medication, and this is not my opinion. It's the opinion of the foremost diabetes center in the world. The Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. Here's what they have to say on the matter. If you have type 1 diabetes, you must take  Daily insulin injections to keep your blood glucose in normal range, your body produces little or no insulin. Insulin is a vital hormone that helps your body convert food into energy, without insulin, you would die. So the answer is far as type 1. Diabetes goes. Well, it's yes, you do need your diabetes medication. But what about type 2. Well, here's what Joseline has to say about that. If you have type 2 diabetes, the answer. This question is much.  It's clear. Many people can keep their blood glucose in a healthy range without medications either oral or insulin if they lose weight and keep their weight down, our regular physically active and follow a meal plan that helps them keep their portion sizes under control. So yes, it is possible for people with diabetes to maintain their blood sugar without medication. So, do you need it? Well, sometimes know, you see the key to managing your diabetes.  Beatty's is to lose weight and regularly exercise and this isn't something you try for a month. This is a lifelong commitment and it can be done. But many fail, eventually many people with type 2, diabetes, find the despite, their best efforts weight control, exercise and diet aren't enough to keep their blood glucose in a healthy range. And this is not unusual and it's not your fault. One theory. Is that some people's insulin-producing cells. Just get tired out from having  To produce more and more insulin because their cells are resistant to the effects of insulin. If your healthcare provider tells you, you need to take oral diabetes medications or insulin injections to manage your blood glucose. It's very important. You follow their instructions, keeping your blood glucose in a healthy range is key to preventing long-term complications such as eye disease, kidney disease, heart attacks and other problems that poorly controlled blood glucose can cause over a period of years including  Amputation. If you want to try and manage your diabetes without medication, then you must let your healthcare provider know your intentions and you need to monitor everything. Very closely. Don't just wake up one day and say I'll Eat Right today. Walk two miles. So I don't need my meds. That would not be a good move.

       " 'J97G6BeYW0I': \"So recently I went into my doctor's office and I was told that my blood pressure was 115 over 75.  So I thought we would talk about exactly what this means and try to figure out how to add a think about blood pressure in general using these numbers in this experience as kind of a launching point. So the way I think about blood pressure is I always imagined kind of a tube and I imagine blood going through that tube and this tube is like a blood vessel. So there's blood trying to get its way from one side to the other and on its way the kind of neat thing that it's doing  Is as it flows, it's pushing out. So it's forcing against these walls.  And specifically what I mean by that in their cells and there's plasma and all that stuff is pushing out against the walls of the blood vessels. So you've got a force.  And that force is being exerted on the surface area of the blood vessel. So it's force over a surface area. And anytime you see force over an area, you know that equals pressure. And in this case, it's a blood pressure because it's the blood that's doing that work.  So this is how I think of blood pressure specifically is those little blue arrows and the two questions that kind of pop into my mind anytime. I'm thinking about blood pressure are where  Is the blood pressure being taken and when are you taking it? So let's start with the first question where and by that. I mean, we're in the circulatory system. So you've got the heart and it's my Valentine's Day heart and you've got the aorta coming off of the heart and it's got lots of branches, but I'm going to just draw one branch, which is the artery leading off to my arms. This is called the brachial artery.  Going off to my arm and usually I'd say 90% of the time maybe even more the blood pressure that you're getting recorded or the number that's being told to you is being checked at this point. I marked it with a little X because that's kind of the upper arm, right? So that's usually where they're checking the blood pressure. And again, they're checking the force that the blood is putting on the vessel wall. So these little blue arrows  so that answer is the where question and certainly you can imagine if I check blood pressure to let's say at some other spot, you know, let's say over here or over here, you know, you might get a different blood pressure reading then if I check it out the yellow X so really we're just talking about that one spot.  Now the other question is, you know, when are you checking out? So for this? Let me show you a little table or a figure other. So imagine that over time time is this way you have different recordings for blood pressure. So this will be blood pressure.  And blood pressure is usually measured in millimeters of mercury. So I'll write millimeters of mercury here and let's go from 200 all the way down to zero and I'll use my numbers that I got from the doctor the other day to illustrate what I'm trying to say. So right at that X that yellow X at the bottom, let's say of my reading I've got 75, so let's start at 75 which is about here.  As the heart is pumping.  The pressure starts building up and gets up to about 115. So really what is happening is blood is making its way from the heart as it squeezes towards that X and as it gets there the force that it's putting on the walls is going up up up and as it goes up and it goes from 75 all the way to 115 so that all happens during this squeezing part of the heart cycle and we call that systole.  This is all happening during systole, which is when the heart is squeezing down and we know the heart is a pump.  Now from that point forward the heart begins to relax. So at this point at 115 the heart is now relaxing slowly and as a relaxes the pressure begins to fall and it continues to fall all the way out here and the pressure gets down to about 75 again, and this is diastole. So this is when the heart is actually taking a break from squeezing and is now refilling and we call that vastly. So I'll call that refilling.  And so during systole you spend about a third of the time.  And in diocese spent about two thirds of the time and I'm talking about one heartbeat here. So this would be one heartbeat.  So it's not 5050 and the easy way to remember this is in a given day a 24-hour day. I spent about eight hours working in about 16 hours relaxing or or not working. And so I think of the heart doing is squeezing its work for eight out of 24 be about a third kind of the same as me about a third of the time the heart is relaxing or I'm sorry squeezing. So that's how the heart is spending its time in systole and diastole and the pressures ranging between 115.  We five so really it's never just 115 or just 75. It's somewhere between the two and you know, for example, if I checked right here in time, you know, it might be lets say 85 or here might be a hundred and two or here might be you know, let's say 87. So it's somewhere between 15 and 115 and 75. So this number then this number I wrote up here becomes a range. This is the range of blood pressure.  So what I talk about when it really depends on when in the cycle you're at and you're somewhere in that range and when I talk about the where we know that we're talking about a reading that's taken in the upper arm. So those are the two thoughts. That should cross your mind. Every time you hear a blood pressure recording. And of course the top number 115 again is the systolic blood pressure and 75 is the diastolic blood pressure.\",\n",
       " 'Jd8QFD5Ht18': \"Cancer cardiovascular disease and chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Like Alzheimer's what we know about. All this chronic disease is that it's driven by sedimentation and malnutrition. This is poor diet and lack of exercise and underpinning, all of this stuff is insulin resistance. And that is why this is such a huge big topic. I mean, I will never stop talking about this because it's really that important. I just want to say at the top of my talk here that I use home. I are a lot in my patients these days. This is homeostatic model assessment.  Of insulin resistance. This is my favorite way to non-invasively measure insulin resistance in my patients. This is something you'll see most commonly in the medical literature. When people are looking at insulin resistance. It's really just your fasting glucose times your fasting insulin / 405, and it's answering the question. And how much insulin does it take when I'm fasting to hold my blood sugar and my fat stores, where they're at right now average in this country is 1.75. That's really a little too high. You want to be a 1.0 or lower anything over about.  Half is clearly insulin resistance. You could just search the medical literature for Homa, ir and any chronic disease, you can think of and it's just a huge linear Association home, ir and cardiovascular disease, huge linear Association, dying of heart attacks, huge Association, cancer, huge Association, all forms of cancer, huge Association. I mean, it's just ridiculous Alzheimer's, pathology massive association with insulin resistance, and finally, just dying.  All-cause mortality and home. I are big Association there too. So this is a really important topic. Okay. So now what causes insulin resistance? Well, we've known forever that the more abdominal fat, you have the more insulin resistant. You are this graph on the right shows insulin levels. You've got normal in green obese, and yellow, and abdominal obesity in Red. So we've known that for a long time, right? But what about this? Here's a graph of insulin sensitivity versus body mass index. And how do you explain these people way down here. They've got  BMI lesson 20 but their insulin sensitivity is terrible. I mean, what's going on here? Right. Well, we've known for over 50 years that the larger your out of a sites, the more insulin resistant, you are right. And in fact, it's a perfectly linear Association. You're out of besides can expand in diameter about 20 times. So if you look at a cross-section of adipocytes under a microscope, they can go from maybe 10, 20 microns to 200 microns. That means their volume can expand by  Thousand times. And as they get bigger, they get more insulin resistant. And it's very, very linear. It turns out that a large out of sites are resistant to the antibiotic effects of insulin and it's harder to shove more fat in there, right? You can graph out fasting insulin Houma. I are any marker, metabolic syndrome. It's perfectly linear without a precise size. Triglycerides. Go up HDL goes down home. IR goes up, insulin goes up any metabolic syndrome, where insulin resistance marker. You measure will completely  Correlate up or down linearly with the size of your adipocytes. If you have gastric bypass surgery and you managed to shrink the size of your out of sites, you'll reverse insulin resistance and diabetes. If you lose weight with any mechanism, it's more important. How much you shrink your out of a sites rather than how much weight you actually lose in terms of reversing insulin resistance. And that's why people can reverse insulin resistance really rapidly. Even before they lose a whole lot of weight. It turns out that as you get, fatter your fat.  Cells can do. One of two things you can have added beside hypertrophy, and that's where your fat cell gets overstuffed with fat, and it's inflamed and it's insulin resistant, and it doesn't want any more fat or glucose or you can have out of a site hyperplasia. If you have the right genetics, you can Sprout. Cute new little baby fat cells that are very insulin sensitive and they're happy to suck up, more fat and they're not inflamed and they're not insulin resistant. So not all your fat cells are like great, your ginormous huge overstuffed. Fat cells are super inflamed there.  Victor dying, they're spewing out fat constantly. It takes a crap ton of insulin to shove that in there. The fat doesn't want to stay in there. But your cute little baby fat cells are very insulin sensitive in there, more than happy to suck up, more fat flux, right? So, you can have two people of identical obesity and the person who's over stuff, their fat cells and had out of sight. Hypertrophy is going to be inflamed and Insulin resistant and it takes a ton of insulin to shove any more fat in there and the fat is constantly spewing.  Back out, but somebody who can Sprout new little baby fat cells is going to stay insulin sensitive forever. If you have the right genetics and you can just Sprout, new fat cells as hyperplasia. You could be 600 pounds. And as long as you have some small fat cells around, it still suck up more fat. You're going to be totally insulin sensitive. This is about 10 percent of obese people. So there's this concept of limit of adipose tissue expansion. Basically, there's a limit to how easily you can get fatter either by sprouting new baby fat cells or expanding the  You've got and once you hit this limit your insulin resistant, so fat is typically stored in the subcutaneous first, and then it spills over into visceral and then it spills over into liver and muscle and pancreas and blood vessels. And you've got ectopic fat and you have fat everywhere and then you're horribly insulin-resistant. Here's a sort of a schematic of how it works. You fill up your subterraneous adipose first. It spills over into visceral that spills over into liver and muscle and now you've got ectopic fat and none of your tissues want any fat or glucose and now your insulin  Distant.  My favorite term when it comes to this concept is personal fat threshold. Pfft. This is a genetic limit to how fat you can get before. You just can't get fatter and your insulin resistant. This explains people who are Toph I thin on the outside but in the inside, I think dr. Berger mentioned that and these are people who look thin, but they've completely maxed out their fat sort of subcutaneous and visceral and they're horribly in some resistors are may be completely diabetic. This is why China and India have  Stop Diabetes prevalence. Compared to the u.s. At a much lower body mass. Index right personal that threshold. This slide is just here to remind me that your giant overstuffed hypertrophy. Fat cells are literally dying these great things on the right are dead out of a sites. And that's why you have so many macrophages are these cells are not happy. They're sick. They're dying. They're inflamed. The little baby fat, cells are happy as clams.  I love this graph right here. It takes a ton of insulin to shove that much fat and to an adipocyte and hold it. There and dependent there, tonically and that fat is constantly trying to spew back out. And that's why people who've Max other fat cells just have high insulin 24/7. This is a beautiful illustration. Okay, the best example, we have of adipose tissue controlling, insulin resistance is lipodystrophy, lipodystrophy is a series of disorders where you don't have any  Is fat or hardly any. I have a bunch of patients with lipodystrophy. They're, they're very unique. They have. They almost look ripped, like, like a bodybuilder. They have very defined arms and legs. They have very little subcutaneous fat, but they have a lot more visceral fat than you would expect. If you do cross-sectional Imaging on these people. The Sub-Q fat in red here is very, very small, but the visceral fat is completely maxed out and almost everyone with Leba dystrophy. Has horrible insulin resistance in  Horrible brittle, diabetic diabetes, all my life, but dystrophy patients, really bad diabetes. It's the worst insulin resistance. Now, you can buy a mouse that has lipodystrophy, right? We found mice that lack subcutaneous fat for whatever reason and we've read them and you can actually buy and sell lipodystrophy mice and it's a great model for insulin resistance and diabetes, because no matter what you feed them. They just completely Max outside butane. He's fat, it all goes to visceral fat, they have fatty liver.  Have visceral fat, their insulin resistant diabetic, just like the humans. And we did this amazing study on these lipodystrophy mice, where we literally surgically implanted, little pouches of fat subcutaneous fat under their skin, and connect it to blood supply, and you instantly magically cure insulin resistance in these mice. Look at this black line on top here. That's the Sham surgery and you're looking at insulin levels versus fat transplant, surgery on the bottom and white, you literally instantly.  We magically cure insulin resistance in these mice, by just in planting set up, you fat on your skin. This is kind of the final nail in the coffin of anyone who doesn't buy into the theory, that adipose controls insulin resistance, right? We haven't done this exact study in humans. I don't think people would really like that. But we do have glitter zones glued his own in his class of diabetes, drug that enables you to get a little bit fatter and it, they don't work that great. That you get a little fatter and your insulin resistance and diabetes gets a little bit better. I  Don't like that. If patients knew how it worked. They probably wouldn't want to take it. Okay, so here's how it works so far, right? You fill up your subcutaneous fat, then it spills over into visceral that spills over into liver and muscle. Now, you've got a topic value, gotta fight everywhere. None of your cells want fed not even tissues want to fail your insulin resistant. What's really going on here is your body is at war with itself. Right? None of your cells want fat. None of your tissues want that, none of them want glucose either, none of them want any of this energy. And it's like this, horrible.  Game of musical chairs where insulin just gets louder and louder and louder until you finally shove some fat or glucose into whatever cell or tissue is the least insulin resistant. And next time, it'll probably be even more insulin resistant. And once your body is at war with itself, like this, the wheels just fall off Your Wagon. And this is why all of these chronic diseases are driven by insulin resistance. Okay? Bottom line so far, your insulin resistant because you filled up all your adipocytes, right? You have no more room for  Watch every time you get a meal, it has nowhere to go the fat or the glucose. So you're just completely filled and that's why your insulin resistant and that's why your hyperinsulinemic and you have high insulin all the time. But that's just, this is just the beginning. I mean, the big question is, why did you fill up your out of a sites? Right? Why are they all full? Is it? Cuz you humans? Shouldn't eat fat because we should be low fat vegan. Is it? Because you're just a glutton and you eat too much, right? No, you filled up your fat cells with fat because you suck. It burning fat.  That because you eat too much glucose. And for contributing factor for obesity is reduced, fat oxidation, increase metabolism of carbohydrates. This has been brought about by shift towards the bodies preference towards oxidizing carbohydrate rather than fat resulting in increased deposition of body fat, you're eating carbs and glucose. You're not burning fat, it accumulates. You fill up your adipose.  Turns out, everybody with obesity insulin resistance act opposite. Fat has defects in mitochondrial metabolism a fat. Everyone in this situation has trouble metabolizing fat in the body.\",\n",
       " 'Ym0i5zT68': \"Hey guys, dr. Axe here, founder of draxe.com and doctor of functional medicine. Today. I'm going to be sharing with you, my Top Foods and supplements for overcoming high blood pressure and believe it or not. Blood pressure is something that can be easily balanced out. If you follow the steps here that I'm going to talk about in this video. So first, let's talk about what causes high blood pressure. And most of the time when you're reading online or in the media today, you're going to see things like excess sodium consumption. Emotional stress and poor diet and lack of exercise. So those are kind of four of the big ones that people say maybe causing high blood pressure. And so let's start off talking about diet. What is the best diet for blood pressure? Whether there are three specific nutrients. You want to make sure that you're getting in your diet. If you have high blood pressure and those include potassium antioxidants, as well as omega-3 fatty acids. In fact, if I had to throw a fourth one in there, I would say magnesium if Can add those four nutrients into your diet and eat foods that are high in those substances? You're going to see your blood pressure, really balance out there very quickly. And so that's going to be a diet that's high in fruits, vegetables, sprouted nuts, and seeds in an organic wild, cop meets and one of the things you may do after watching this video is go to my site. Dr. Axe.com, do a search for potassium, rich foods, magnesium, rich foods, and omega-3, rich foods, and if you  Go and look at those food list. You'll see things like avocados are packed with magnesium and potassium. So actually doing guacamole would be great for you or consuming chia seeds or wild caught salmon or you know, other foods like that figs or super high in potassium as well. And so again, I would go online and look up foods that are really high in potassium, magnesium, omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants as well and we have actually all of those top 10 list there on.  Draxe.com. So that should be diet. Some things you want to avoid diet-wise. When you're following a healthy blood pressure diet as avoid excess sodium intake. So you don't want to overdo the salt. A little bit of sea salt is fine, but definitely staying away from the processed. I had I saw really eliminating processed sugar, you know, processed sugar will definitely cause your blood pressure to spike. And then of course, processed and fast foods that contain hydrogenated oils. We know those are inflammatory to the body.  The that inflammation in the arteries will cause blood pressure to rise, an actual cause high cholesterol as well. And so, again, you get those Foods out, add in those mineral, and vitamin rich foods in, you're going to see immediate results in your blood pressure and then in terms of the best supplements to naturally treat blood pressure. I want to go over the top ones here. First one would be fish oil. Fish oil is high in omega-3 fatty acids. Those omega-3 fatty acids, called EPA and DHA.  Our highly anti-inflammatory and we know that high blood pressure is in part caused by inflammation. So if you can start adding in wild-caught fish into your diet and taking a good quality fish oil supplement at about 1000 milligrams a day. You will see results very quickly in your blood pressure. The second most important supplement to take for blood pressure is magnesium, you know, magnesium helps, relax your blood vessel walls, and improve circulation. And  And reduces stress in your body. And so all of those things are benefits of taking magnesium, which will naturally lower blood pressure. Typically, you want to take 250 mg of magnesium 2 times a day and I recommend a magnesium chelate supplement. When you take that the third supplement, you may want to consider taking if you have high blood pressure is Coenzyme, Q10, and this is absolutely absolutely essential as well. If you've ever taken a cholesterol-lowering medication, coenzyme Q10 is an antioxidant.  That that supports heart health and circulation, and also acts as an antioxidant. And so again coenzyme Q10 about 200 milligrams. A day is a great supplement for helping blood pressure issues. The for supplement would be garlic, you know, you can actually eat garlic or take garlic extract but garlic contains allicin, as well as other phytonutrients that kill off bad bacteria in your body and act as antioxidants that help lower blood pressure. You can also use lavender essential.  Chalo loyal. Lavender oil has been shown to reduce stress, which was what is one of the major causes of high blood pressure. Typically, take about two to four drops of lavender oil. Rub it on your neck and you will see that start to improve your overall blood pressure as well. And then, last but not least, in lowering blood pressure. I would recommend daily exercise. You don't have to exercise every day, but just 20 to 30 minutes three times a week of exercise can make a huge difference. I recommend checking out interval.  Like, my burst fit program is one of the best ways to get fit fast, but also just in general, any form of exercise whether it be weight, training, walking, Pilates bar classes, or even group classes, all of those are effective forms of exercise at happen, helping naturally lower your blood pressure. Hey guys, I hope you've enjoyed these top tips to naturally lower blood pressure. If you want to learn more. Hey, you can check out dr. Axe.com simply search high blood pressure. I've got more.  More articles and tips on there as well. Hey guys has been dr. Axe with my top healthy, blood pressure tips.\",\n",

       " 'JjWDCldrYGY': \"In fatty acid oxidation and Storage by cellular energy status and by insulin.  Now, let's look at what would happen when we eat fat or carbohydrate to see whether insulin is actually going to lead to net fat storage because of its signaling in response to carbohydrate or whether the true determinant of fat storage is the energy balance of our cells and our whole system. When looked at together shown  Screen is the normal transport route of glucose.  Glucose comes from the small intestine goes through the portal, vein to the liver, goes from the liver, through the hepatic veins, to the inferior, vena cava where it goes into the heart, and then comes out of the heart through the aorta, and through multiple arteries, goes too many organs. Every single one of these organs expresses glute one and glute 3, which are glucose Transporters that, do not respond to insulin that allows.  The glucose going through at normal fasting levels to give every cell of every tissue, whatever glucose it needs.  When glucose Rises after a high carbohydrate meal, the extra carbohydrate load first goes from the small intestine to the liver, through the portal vein.  The liver expresses glue to which also doesn't respond to insulin, but is distinguished from glute one. And three by being relatively low affinity for glucose. What that means is that you need a lot of glucose to make it active. So the liver has glute one and glute three, but it has a lot of glue to that is they're ready to kick in at High.  And some glucose.  And the fact that glute to needs a lot of glucose to become active means that the high expression of glue to in the liver is not going to make you hypoglycemic. When you don't have a big glucose load in, but it will be very effective at skimming the extra glucose. Off the top. When you do have a big glucose load coming in, in addition, the liver also expresses a specific form of hexokinase known as glucokinase oral.  Turn it of Leah's hexokinase 4, which is not inhibited by glucose-6-phosphate.  Ordinarily in other tissues, if you had an accumulation of glucose 6-phosphate you would inhibit glucose uptake. But in this case you have glute to skimming the extra glucose off the top of the additional glucose load. And then all that extra glucose is going to go through to glucose-6-phosphate without hexokinase being inhibited because of the expression.  Into this specific form of hexokinase hexokinase for or glucokinase. And what that does is it allows glucose-6-phosphate to reach high levels that turn on glycogen synthase and lead to the repletion of hepatic glycogen. So because of the unique expression of glue to and glucokinase in the liver relative to most other tissues with the exception of the pancreas and because the liver lies first along the  circulatory route from the small intestine to the liver. The first thing you do with an extra hepatic with an extra glucose load is you replete your livers glycogen stores before you do anything else.  After you've repeated, your hepatic glycogen stores, the extra glucose, that's left over goes through the hepatic veins through the inferior. Vena, cava into the heart from the heart. It goes through the aorta. And then through multiple arteries to reach many, different tissues among. These are skeletal muscle pancreas and adipose tissue.  That glucose load can get taken up by glute 1 and glute 3 in any of these other tissues, but the extra glucose load, that's well beyond the normal circulating. Fasting levels of glucose. That hasn't been taken up by the liver. For glycogen storage is going to be first taken up by the pancreas because the pancreas also expresses glute to and glucokinase.  That expression of glue to and glucokinase allows the pancreas to take the second scoop off. The top of the extra glucose load and that's the primary driver of insulin. When the pancreas makes insulin, the insulin then acts on tissues, that Express glued for and hexokinase to  these include adipose tissue and they include skeletal muscle. And although not shown in this diagram. They also include the heart.  The expression of insulin sensitive glute for and hexokinase, to allows the insulin produced by that extra glucose load. That reached the pancreas first to stimulate skimming the rest of the top of that extra glucose load into skeletal muscle and adipose tissue.  In skeletal muscle, the glucose can primarily have three Fates If energy status in the skeletal muscle is low. The glucose primarily gets converted to acetyl co a the acetyl co a can enter the citric acid cycle and be burned for energy. If energy status in the muscle cell is low and the glycogen content is also low. Then the glucose is used to replete the muscular glycogen stores.  If the energy status is high and the glycogen content is also High, the glucose is rejected from the cell because there's nothing to do with it, that leaves the glucose in the blood before we can talk about the relative fates of glucose. In adipose tissue. We need to first talk about glycerol.  Imagine that adipose tissue has expressed lipoprotein lipase or LPL so that it can take up triglycerides, LPL, releases glycerol and fatty acids inside the capillary that then go into the adipose tissue and they need to be reassembled into a triglyceride.  The glycerol is a three carbon backbone. That's attached to Three fatty acids. 18 each carbon.  Not glycerol. Cannot go directly into triglyceride synthesis instead because triglyceride synthesis is energy intensive. You need to phosphorylate it to glycerol. Phosphate in this diagram, that's called L, glycerol 3-phosphate because the phosphate is on carbon 3, and it's called L. Because you'll notice that, the central carbon is chiral, meaning, there's one, two, three, four different things attached to it.  So, it can form isomers, where the relative orientation of those four things in the order around, the carbon can become important.  But we're not dealing with a d glycerol, phosphate. So we can just call this glycerol phosphate.  In order to get glycerol, phosphate you need the enzyme glycerol. Kinase, the glycerol. Kinase is mainly expressed in the liver and not in adipose tissue. So some low carbohydrate Advocates have suggested that carbohydrate is needed to store fat in adipose tissue precisely for this reason because you can't reuse the glycerol backbone that came directly from fat and you need a way to get glycerol phosphate in order to  Synthesize the triglyceride in the adipose tissue to keep it there. And in fact, there's some truth to the biochemistry here in that you can get glycerol phosphate from glycolysis. If glucose were in the adipose tissue glycolysis would generate the triose phosphate to dihydroxyacetone, phosphate and glyceraldehyde phosphate, which are interconverted. With triose phosphate isomerase. Dihydroxyacetone, phosphate can be reduced to glycerol.  3-phosphate notice it already has the phosphate on the third carbon. It differs from glycerol phosphate because the middle carbon has a carbonyl instead of a hydroxyl group. So nadh reduces that carbonyl to the hydroxyl group converting dihydroxyacetone, phosphate from glycolysis to the glycerol 3-phosphate that can be used for triglyceride synthesis, but notice here that this is a reversible reaction.  It's catalyzed by glycerol, 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and it can be used. Both to allow glycerol to enter glycolysis going from left to right in the liver because the liver expresses glycerol, kinase, or it can allow glucose to yield the glycerol, phosphate needed for triglyceride synthesis.  But notice also that if this is a reversible reaction, the direction is going to depend on the relative concentration of the reactants.  And to go from dihydroxyacetone. Phosphate to glycerol. Phosphate requires. Nadh as a reactant in nadh occurs in the presence of high energy. Status to go the other way requires nad+, as a reactant NAD, plus is abundant in conditions of low energy status.  so what that means is that high energy status favors using glucose for triglyceride synthesis, but low energy, status favors using glycerol as a source of  Energy for glycolysis to use for energy metabolism. So the principal fates of glucose in adipose tissue are. If energy status is low, glucose will be turned into acetyl Co a for all of the reasons that apply to skeletal muscle.  If energy status is high and you have a lot of nadh\",\n",

Dr. Richard Lee with the cancer center for y e is here to talk about how patients can Access, state-of-the-art Medical Treatments and help Advance Medical Science by participating in these trials. Hello. Dr. Thanks for joining us. Thank you. So lung cancer. I hear that. That's one of the most common cancers.  Jurors in the world, but very difficult to treat. Is that true? Yes, it can, it's definitely one of the most common cancers in the world because of smoking is very difficult to treat if it's caught because it's caught a lot of the tons in the late stages, but more recently in the past few years. We've been catching them early with, CT based, screening and catching them at an earlier stage, which is more manageable and you can get higher rates of cure. Unfortunately. You got that other half a population where they're caught.  Leg stage where they started in the middle of the lung and they go to the middle part of the chest, making, it very challenging to treat the best way to treat them for these locally. Advanced cancers is with a combined mode bet modality. But sometimes if surgery isn't possible, then you have to treat it with just chemotherapy and radiation alone. Okay. We are talking about clinical trials, today, and last month. We do, you explain what that is and how it benefits, right?  The medical field and also individuals, what are some trials that can treat lung cancer? So, the one that's currently open by the University of Hawaii, cancer center, and our Cancer Center is, we look at the current trial called SWOG 1206 which takes locally Advanced, lung, cancer, patients, and randomize them between the standard arm of chemotherapy and radiation or chemotherapy radiation, followed, by what we call the agent called, the leper, pelipper AB  So that's the main one. Is this swag 1206 that you're treating now, right? Okay, but there are others, others, like the metformin trial that was recently closed. And the one that's about to be open is the PDL 1 inhibitor called Novella bab. It stimulate the immune cells to attack the cancer cells. Okay, if someone wants to be a part of the clinical trial for lung cancer, how long does it take to get the results and that varies by how common the cancer is?  The number of pages to enter the trial, the patient's willingness, and of course, the healthcare provider trying to get the patients into the trial. All these factors play a role in trying to get results from the trial. So it can take like five years for a role, a patient in a big phase 3 trial, which is a randomized, trial and fortunately, there's something called interim analysis, that looks at halfway points to say, is this drug Morgan? Is it not working? And so we can give  Like in a feedback mechanism whether we what we should do in the middle of the trial, but ultimately, it takes a long time. Okay, if you are watching and you want more information, they can talk to their doctor, right? To see how they can get involved with the clinical trial. Yeah, and that's definitely a key thing. It's because every patients different to we have to look at their eligibility enrollment. Do they have a history of heart, heart issues, diabetes, kidney problems, these all play an important role.  Role in whether they're eligible for a trial because these drugs can have an effect on their on their other body organs and that they have to make sure it's safe. Doctor Lee. Thank you very much. I know that this is a lot of information and it me go over your head, but we're going to post the information on our website. And again the main thing is to know that we have a place here in Hawaii where people can be a part of a clinical trial and for more information. Everyone can speak with their doctor. So thank you very much. We are going to have much more.  Or on, living 808. When we come back, stay with us.\",\n",
       " 'LscoVyV4zA': \"One of the most serious, chronic complications of diabetes. Mellitus is a condition known as diabetic nephropathy, which if you break down the term into Neff row. And pathy, literally means kidney disease. That occurs secondary to diabetes and it's actually pretty common as it eventually affects about 20 to 40 percent of all individuals with diabetes, including both type 1 and type 2 in this tutorial. Let's talk about the mechanism. Underlying, the cause of diabetic nephropathy.  Why and how individuals with diabetes develop the condition. So, diabetic nephropathy is a chronic complication of diabetes mellitus meaning. It usually has a slow progression over decades after the initial diagnosis of diabetes. And to give you an overview of what happens, an insulin deficiency, due to the diabetes results in hyperglycemia, which then causes hypertension and kidney, dysfunction. This kidney function, is actually them further worsened by the hypertension and ultimately, all of this.  It's in kidney failure, which can have very severe and potentially even life-threatening complications such as anemia, electrolyte imbalances, such as metabolic acidosis and heart arrhythmias. Now, before we dive into the mechanism of diabetic nephropathy, let's briefly review the structure of the glomerulus in the kidney by bringing in a diagram here. So the glomerulus is the portion of the kidney where blood is initially filtered. So blood enters the glomerulus over here through this,  This efferent arteriole and then leaves the glomerulus through the efferent arteriole and you can remember this that it leaves through the efferent arteriole for E4 exit or efferent. And while the blood is within the glomerulus. There's this Advanced filtration system, which we'll talk about more in a minute and the filtered fluid that exits. The blood is known as the filtrate and it collects in Bowman's space before it enters into the tubules of the Nephron where further reabsorption and secretion.  Occurs before it exits, the kidney into the ureters as urine. Now, one last structure to point out in this diagram, is this vessel coming off the efferent who you'll hear. Now, this vasculature actually wraps around the tubules of the Nephron and contributes to the reabsorption and secretion of solutes. Now to add to this diagram. Let's imagine, we took a cross section of this culinary list and look at it on its end and it would look a little bit, something like this. Now, we can use this diagram here to better.  Picked some of the important structures within the glomerulus. So here you can see the capillary vessels and each of them. I've drawn in here a little red blood cell to help remind you that it's a blood cell. And as you can see, these vessels are surrounded by a few additional structures that we couldn't really appreciate in that first diagram. So these are the structures that contribute to the three layered filtration system of the glomerulus. The first layer is that of the vascular endothelium. So the endothelial cover the inside of the blood vessels,  Capillary wall there and then the second layer is the glomerular basement membrane or GBM for short, which is a specialized basement membrane that surrounds the vascular endothelium.  And then the last filtration layer is the visceral epithelium, which is also known as the podocytes now in between all of these capillaries here is the museum which is comprised of cells known conveniently as mesangial cells and they produce a collagen Network that structurally supports all of these capillaries and it's across this space that filtration occurs within the glomerulus of the kidney. So how exactly does diabetes a problem with in.  In division, see result in kidney damage. Well the answer includes multiple compounding factors. Now, the first component is an increased pressure state within the nephron and this is due to two mechanisms. And the first is hypertension, which is a common comorbidity associated with diabetes mellitus. So hypertension or high blood pressure results in an increased pressure throughout the entire arterial, vascular system, and this includes the afferent arteriole of the glomerulus.  And so to think about how this increases the pressure within the glomerulus, let's think about a simple garden hose. So in the middle of the garden hose, there's a whole and as water flows through the hose, a small amount of water will leak out through this hole. But if we open up this bigot all the way, this is going to increase the pressure of the water traveling through the hose and intuitively. This change is going to result in more water leaking from the hole here in the center. And that's because there's  Increased pressure forcing it out of the hole. Now. This is similar to what occurs in the glomerulus. The hypertension increases the pressure just like turning on that spigot which in return increases, the filtration rate of the glomerulus, which can be thought of that. Leakiness from the hole in the garden. Hose. Now the other mechanism contributing to this high pressure state is something known as vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole, which is just a fancy way of saying that this blood vessel constructs or get smaller in diameter.  So to understand why this occurs, we need to briefly review, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system or Ras for short. So renin is a hormone that's secreted by the kidneys in response to decrease renal perfusion or low blood flow to the kidney. And this is a sign of low fluid volume throughout the body. So in response to a low fluid volume, renin has a Cascade of effects in order to maintain blood pressure as well as volume status.  And one of these effects is constriction of the efferent arteriole which then maintains this pressure within the glomerulus in the presence of a decreased renal perfusion. So once again, let's go back to this. Garden hose to understand this a little bit better. Now, instead of turning turning up the spigot, as we did before. What do you think would happen? If you were to Kink the hose on the other side of the hole? Once again intuitively. This is going to increase the pressure behind the Kink and subsequently.  Increase the rate at which water leaks out of the hole. So once again, this is similar to what occurs in the glomerulus in response to activation of this renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. There's a constriction of the efferent arteriole to build up pressure within the glomerulus to maintain the necessary filtration. And therefore it will increase the filtration rate even further, but why exactly is this happening? If I just said that individuals with diabetes often have increased renal perfusion due to the hypertension, then  Why is a low pressure system such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activated and it's a good question and the answer is not exactly intuitive. For some reason, the underlying physiology of diabetes, specifically the hyperglycemia results in a direct intra renal or within the kidney, activation of this renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and subsequently efferent vasoconstriction, independent of the volume status of the individual and therefore increases the  Either filtration rate. So how does this increase pressure relate to diabetic nephropathy. Well, as a pressure within the glomerulus, increases this results in a process known as mesangial expansion. The increased pressure results in trauma and damage to the Museum of the glomerulus and in responses to damage the museum jail cells respond by secreting, cytokines that produce inflammation as well as oxygen free radicals, that result in endothelial dysfunction.  And all of this kind of combines into hypertrophy and Matrix accumulation within the Byzantium, which is known as mesangial expansion. And as you can see over here on the right as the museum expands the spaces, or what are known as the fenestrations between the podocytes foot processes. Expand. Now this has two effects first, it decreases the surface area available within the glomerulus for filtration and second the dilation of the fenestrations.  Causes the filtration system to be leaky and larger molecules such as proteins are filtered out of the blood in the kidney. Then the last Factor contributing to diabetic nephropathy is a combination of the previously mentioned factors. And this is ischemia. As I mentioned earlier, the blood vessels supplying, the tubules of the Nephron come off of the efferent arteriole and vasoconstriction of this arterial from the intra-regional activation of the renin-angiotensin.  Angiotensin aldosterone system decreases, this blood flow and in addition the cytokines and free radicals produced from the barrel trauma to the museum further damage, the nephron vasculature and over time these processes result in ischemia or cell death and atrophy of the vasculature that supports the glomerulus as well as the two bills. So this will decrease the kidneys ability to filter blood and is ultimately what will lead to  Kidney, failure and diabetic nephropathy. So, as you can see, there are many different mechanisms that are going to contribute to the progression of kidney failure, in individuals with diabetes mellitus. However, it's important to note that they are all directly associated with the underlying hyperglycemia. And therefore the progression towards kidney failure can be slow or potentially even prevented if the underlying diabetes is well controlled.\",\n",

       " 'fH_Napq9c': \"David Invokana, a blockbuster Diabetes Type 2 drug, we're finding out now. It has a lot of negative side effects as often happens with some of these Blockbuster drugs, before we get into those real quick. Just kind of give us an overview of what Invokana is specifically used for, you know, as far as the diagnosis and things of that nature. Well, this is another Johnson & Johnson product, which has become incredibly popular. They put a lot of  A lot of money behind it. It is a drug to deal with the control of diabetes, which of course is a condition that millions of people have and diabetes has a lot to do with the acid levels in the particular patient. And this is an inhibitor of some of those issues and has helped to control the diabetes issues. But what we're seeing is again, with real safety concerns with Johnson and Johnson, being raised, and real, very serious concerns.  A lot of very serious adverse side effects for these patients where, you know, it appears that Johnson & Johnson is not properly tested. This Blockbuster Mark Drug before bringing it to Market and putting millions and millions of dollars behind their advertising instead of more clinical trials, prior to pushing it out Nationwide. And what's really interesting is it, you know, Invokana commercials are very common on television, obviously, because, you know, type 2. Diabetes is becoming more and more common. These  He's Dazed. And so in these commercials, as we've often seen, they show the happy people. Once they're on the medication. They're living their lives are out there having fun, their barbecue in there. They're exercising. And then in the the real, you know, professional speak, they start giving all these Invokana, make calls yada yada, yada yada, and that's what they do. I mean there is a difference. The, the side effects are spoken at a high school grade level. The benefits of the drugs are always spoken at a grade.  Cool level. This, you know, study after study has shown that, this is the way that these drugs are marketed. And when we're talking about a drug like Invokana, we're looking at something that is causing kidney failure. Heart attacks ketoacidosis. And this is a drug that is meant to, you know, help excrete blood sugar from the bloodstream through the kidneys. And now, those were just the first side effects. We know of now we're starting to see things where people  are losing limbs as a result of taking this medication. Yeah, that's right. I mean, that's the latest FDA advisory that's come out. Is that there are a number of cases of amputation. Of course, you know, diabetes patients are can be prone to risk for amputation and loss of limb loss of toes. A lot of times, that's where it starts. If you have a serious diabetes condition, you have to always be cognizant of that. But the information that's coming out as in this recent clinical trial.  It's the FDA has issued an advisory about it and said that they're going to be checking into further. Is that the Invokana drug is greatly increasing the propensity for these types of amputation. So first this is this is how the kind of the pattern for a lot of these drugs unfortunately is played out is it just information keeps on seeping out about some of the concerns here first, starting with heart attack, stroke bone fracture and things like that. As last year. Those were the advisories that are coming out and now more recently.  Recently, the amputation wrist. So the issue is that with a lot of these drugs, there are side-effects, of course, but the issue is, whether the manufacturer in this case, Johnson & Johnson has proper, have properly warned about the potential side effects, so that the physician and the patient can make an educated decision about whether or not the drug is Pros, outweigh the potential cons and the risk and Johnson and Johnson has not properly warned of these risks, which are now are only coming out after the fact. And that is really the  Thing, you know, Johnson Johnson, we think of it as such a household product in the baby to baby shower and and talcum powder which were we're learning a lot about cervical cancer. They are unfortunately, but it's a household name, but obviously with the systemic problems at Johnson & Johnson, it certainly appears at advertising and profit is a primary motive here. Perhaps over patient, safety. We know you pointed out something very interesting there and I want to expand on that just a little bit. And that's the fact that it's not  that the drug or any drugs, cause side effects. So, you know, even Ibuprofen and Tylenol can cause side effects. A lot of it has to do with the risk-benefit analysis, you know, the side effect of it, versus what it does. But the most important thing in this is where lawsuits come from is, what did the company? No, did they hide it? Did they properly deliver this information to Physicians and patients? And it's when there is a cover-up or when they did not,  Disclose that they face liability. It's not just because their product, you know, isn't doing everything it says. It's because they knew it wouldn't and they hid the dangers. And I think that's something that the public needs to understand. People don't just get sued, you know, for no reason that's because there was a cover-up because there was no warning. That's correct. That's correct in. You know, the warnings and we see the fine print and so forth. But and you wonder how much consumers really understand. As you say with the TV commercials are you  Look in the, you know, the weekly periodicals and things. And you've got all this fun print, which of course goes goes over, everyone's head. But a lot of it is education to the Physicians as well. Instead, Johnson & Johnson is paying tens of millions of dollars in marketing, the products for medical Consultants, why literally wining and dining. A lot of Physicians to the tune of a couple million dollars in food and beverage expenditures for this particular drug, and so their glossing over a lot of these issues and either they knew the problems and they  And given proper warnings or they didn't do sufficient, you know, medical and clinical trials to determine what the side effects were. And so if a black box warning goes on in particular, drug Studies have shown that the prescriptions of that drug may go down by about 40%. And that's what these manufacturers don't want. And so they're making an oftentimes. Unfortunately, they're making calculated decisions about whether it's better to avoid the Black Box warning and take their chances on the liability side and deal with the  Lawsuits that come, as a result of the various injuries, amputations stroke heart attack or deaf versus having a there, you know, drug, which they're talking about on their quarterly Wall Street conference calls. That this is a great deal. We're getting great market share in this huge patient population for diabetes. So that is the issue is the Black Box. Warnings appropriate warnings to the patients. The patients need to Johnson Johnson, a very sophisticated company. They need to be putting out all of the information that they have about these drugs have  Can make informed decisions. As we've seen too many times. That always comes down to profits over patients. And that's why your people like you the trial lawyers, Mike papantonio and Howard and Michael Berg all the part of the show. That's why you guys are out there doing what you do every day to help protect American consumers, and we appreciate your work both in the courtroom and on this show, so David.

Correct ended up in the diabetes prevention program through my health insurance. My doctor recommended me to the program.  In the classes, we go over many things, how much food we eat and what type of foods that we can eat and better Foods Forest than we normally would eat.  I do eat a lot of fresh vegetables and fresh food.  Anything that's processed. We do look at the labels, very closely to make sure how much fat is in. Mm. You know, how much sodium is in them?

       " 'JqJaVvLO748': \"Hi, I'm Ansley from diabetes what to know and I'm here today to talk about the signs and symptoms of diabetes many people wonder if they have diabetes and you may be wondering what are the warning signs of diabetes. What's the first clue unfortunately diabetes itself doesn't have any symptoms I say unfortunately because of diabetes, whereas easy to recognize as the common cold people would go to their doctor at the first sign of trouble instead. We can only look at the signs and symptoms of high blood. Her which often don't occur until diabetes is already in place some of those symptoms include frequent urination. If you're going to the bathroom a lot even during the night that could be a sign of diabetes as blood glucose goes up the body tries to get rid of that excess sugar through urine and the excess sugar drawers water with it so that you end up going to the bathroom more often this can occur slowly over a long period of time which makes it easy for people to ignore it or get used to it excessive thirst.  When you go to the bathroom more frequently Your Body compensates by increasing your thirst so that you can replace the Lost water. Now you may have thought that you were going to the bathroom all the time because you've been drinking so much water or soda or juice. But actually it's the other way around high blood sugar causes you to go to the bathroom a lot which makes you thirsty and if you drink sugary drinks like Kohler sweet tea, it only makes things worse blurry vision is another symptom of high blood sugar large changes in the glucose in your blood can temporarily  Change the shape of the lens in your eye causing your vision to be poorly focused or blurry. This is only temporary. There's no permanent change in the lens. Once you get your blood sugar levels within your target range your vision will improve another sign of diabetes is urinary infections and yeast infections particularly in women, if any of these symptoms persist you should visit your doctor a quick and easy blood test can tell you whether or not you have diabetes if you find that you do have diabetes.  He's know that you can do very well by paying just a little attention to it. Having diabetes isn't so bad unless you ignore it and then it can be very bad and remember all the signs and symptoms are caused by the high blood sugar not the diabetes itself. And these symptoms are temporary. Once your blood glucose levels are in range and stable you're going to feel a million times better.

       " 'JSFiOF7xGfE': \"D and our units are going to be mg per deciliter. And actually, let me just do it this way. Let me just say that. Everything is in milligrams per deciliter a liter and we'll talk in the future videos about well, what kind of how we can relate these units to Everyday terms, but let's say that, this right here, is 50, this right here is 100, this right here is 150, and let's  a kit right here at 200. So let's think about what would happen for a normal person? Let me Mark some hours over here. So our 12345678. That's probably good enough. So the normal person, when they haven't eaten anything for a long time, let's say greater than eight hours. So their fasting blood sugar will be right around 80 milligrams per deciliter give or take.  A little bit. There's a range around that but I just want to show you what would happen to a normal person. So an 80 80 milligrams per deciliter. Their blood sugar will kind of be should hopefully be right around there and sometimes this fasting blood sugar and maybe we're assuming that this is in the morning. So maybe this our one is seven in the morning so they haven't eaten for a while and that's why it's fasting blood sugar. This is all so you'll hear and kind of you'll sometimes hear doctor's wife heard. My wife say, this word, without knowing what it meant. They'll sometimes say, pre-printed.  And eel free prandial, which is a very fancy word, which just means before a meal, prandial is literally, before eating after the meal, you're talking postprandial. So it's a very fancy word for a very simple idea eating. So let's say it our to this individual eats breakfast. So this is right. This is where the individual is going to eat breakfast. Now in a normal person when that person eats breakfast will be  Carbohydrates, some carbohydrates in that breakfast and it will be broken down into glucose and glucose will enter the bloodstream and so their blood glucose will go up. Their blood glucose will go up. It will slowly go up and I was reading some studies. They say it kind of It kind of spikes at about 45 minutes into a meal. So let's see. 45 minutes is over there. So maybe it'll go up to about there and in a normal individual the blood glucose really shouldn't go up above.  120 milligrams per deciliter and all who, you know, there's obviously exceptions to all of these were just kind of saying a normal breakfast, a normal person. They're not, you know, they're not eating a pint of honey. You're not doing something crazy. So let's say 120 would be right around right around there. A normal person. You wouldn't someone who does not have diabetes. It would be unlikely that it would go above that. And then actually, after about two hours. They're getting pretty close to normal to get back under. 100 milligrams per deciliter.  And then you go beyond two hours. They just kind of get close back to their Baseline to that 80 milligrams per deciliter. So once again, this is this is normal and of course, you know, don't freak out if you were to take a blood test one morning and you're at like 80 5 milligrams per deciliter. You're still not far off from normal. So obviously there's some variation from person to person. Now if someone has diabetes, if either they don't have time,  Type one there. They don't have enough insulin to actually process the glucose or if they have enough insulin, but their body is a desensitized to it. The insulin isn't being processed properly. So they can't process the, the glucose we've seen that the glucose concentrations will go up. And so in general, if you were to wake up one morning after not having eaten for more than eight hours and you were to pick your prick, your finger, with one of those little glucose monitors, you can get at the drugstore and in your  Your finger, the blood sugar levels. If you were to find them to be, let's say you were to find them to be at 100. Let's say 140 140, that's 140 milligrams per deciliter. It's a good indication. I mean, you shouldn't freak out. You should do multiple tests and make sure that that, you know, it wasn't a false reading or any of that. And you should definitely see a doctor once again, don't view this as any type of medical advice. That is not the purpose of this. The purpose of this is just to  And a little bit of what's going on. Don't don't ya. Don't change your lifestyle based on anything. I tell you. All right. So if you but if you do experience that, it looks like at least just from that one data point that your body isn't processing sugar properly because you've had over eight hours to process the sugar for insulin to go in your bloodstream and and a lot of glucose to be taken up and get back down to a normal level, but it still hasn't gone there. So if you were to, if you were to test a value like that you should you should be concerned about  General, the threshold. And I've seen multiple thresholds here are between 100 and I've seen High kind of mid 120 to 130 milligrams per deciliter. So that's kind of, let me do it in this range. It's kind of. If you are above, if your fasting blood sugar is above this line right here. Remember the fasting blood sugar, not after you've eaten a meal, your pre prandial before a meal. If it is above that threshold right over there. Then you should, at least you should definitely see a doctor and make sure that they can, they can  and, you know, see if you, if you have diabetes, but this would be cause for concern. The other thing is, if after a meal, it spikes. Well, beyond that, if we're talking, if it gets above 180 and, you know, once again, these are all just thresholds that people, you know, doctors have come up with and researchers have come up with it. Say hey, this is a good indication that somehow you are not processing glucose properly. So 180 180 is up here and I'm drawing it as a squiggly line because it's kind of a range. It's not like, you know, it's not like a hundred you if your blood glucose is.  24, you're safe and all of a sudden at 125, you have diabetes, you know, they're, you know, they're not that different than each other, but they have to set up some threshold so that just to kind of have a threshold, I guess. So if your blood sugar, after eating a meal were to spike up to let's say, 200 once again, that would be cause for concern. So in general if someone has diabetes because they're not processing, the glucose properly after their blood glucose might look something like this, so maybe  Be there fasting, blood glucose is right around 125 130. It can move around, then they have a meal then it might Spike up and they might have obviously they can process some of the glucose. Otherwise they would they would die, but it's not being processed properly. So the glucose levels, don't go down to where they should and maybe you get some, some glucose gets taken up from the blood. Obviously, they're living so their cells are metabolizing something, but it never gets down to  Do the normal eighty milligrams per deciliter? It might go. It might settle down back to Something in the 120 range or something like that, which would be, cause for concern. And in general. If you're someplace in jail. I've seen the threshold. If you're above 100 and it kind of fasting basis. That's cause for concern you should, maybe adjust your lifestyle. And if you're above if you if you're above 120 130 after a meal, once again, this you should also be slightly worried that  you might maybe are pre-diabetic or you have some risk of that developing it diabetes. So this is what this is a high. If someone has blood sugar like this, they're probably diabetic and if someone has blood sugar like this, they should be, they should be worried. But once again, I am not a doctor don't take any of this as an advice. This is really just our attempt to to understand things a little bit better.\",\n",
       " 'FbDIvQRw': \"I only get to do this YouTube video in one take, so I hope you'll bear with me. So as a diabetic when I eat, my blood sugar goes up. When I take insulin, my blood sugar goes down. It's kind of like flying a plane and adjusting the altitude. Eat it goes up. Insulin it goes down. So I try to fly nice and steady so I don't crash into the ground. I don't float away. Typically I use a needle to give myself that insulin. My body doesn't produce any insulin.  My pancreas doesn't work and give myself a shot here and there. But some point, I'm going to be giving myself eight ten shots. So I use what's called an insulin pump. My insulin pump sits right here. It's on my belt. It's got a little bunch of insulin in their big long tube. That's plugged into me. It's plugged in to me all the time. See these bruises. That's because I'm putting holes in myself faster than I can heal them. When the insulin pump runs out like it did tonight. I have to fill it.  So here's what I do. When I change my insulin pump, take this off. This is a little port.  Pull this off me. Now. I've got a hole in me. That's the little needle. It's called a cannula that was sticking at me. That's where the insolent came out. Throw that away.  Then I'm going to take the insulin pump to pull out the tubing. This is disposable. This goes away. Now. I've got an empty insulin pump going to tell this pump to rewind, get ready for a new bunch of insulin.  Just screw the crime. That's moving backwards right there. That's the plunger that's rewinding you can hear it. Well that's rewinding. Take a fresh.  Reservoir.  A bunch of insulin, push air into it now. I'm pulling it out. Filling up the reservoir with insulin. I do this every three days. Insulin is measured in units.  I give myself about 30 units a day. Disconnect. It insulin goes way. I've got a reservoir full of insulin and I take this. This is also disposable. I have to buy these pretty expensive.  This is that tubing. It's a fresh one. Plug the reservoir into the tubing.  I'll take this want to put it inside the pump. So take that and put it inside the pump and I'm going to tell the pump, but I've got some.  It's going to start to push.  That's filling up the tube, you see.  See, the insulin dropping out. Put the pump down. Temporarily. Take this thing here. I'm going to put it inside this.  This is a little plunger.  I want to put this.  On top of it. There's a little sticker. Pull the sticker off.  You see that? Blue thing on top is a needle under their push it down into the plunger. Pull that off.  Needles in there.  I use my arm.  That's plugged in me. Pull out the needle, that's the needle.  That one that we threw away earlier.  Just a little plastic tube is in there. So now the pump is plugged into the tube, which is plugged into me. I wear it 24 hours a day. I wear it, when I sleep, I put it underneath my pillow clip, it onto my belt 24 hours a day. The only time I take it off is for a few minutes when I shower. So this is easier than shots and now I can do little tiny adjustments to my plane. That's flying.  Unfortunately, though pumps are expensive. A lot of people who don't live in Western countries can't get ahold of pumps. It's a lot of money in here. There's a couple thousand bucks and they usually paid for by insurance, but you usually have to fight your insurance company to get them. So that's thing. Number one. Every three days. I do this maneuver that we just did every three days, take the pump, put in my pocket. I think number two. I'm going to put in a continuous glucose meter. Sometimes you hear about diabetics that prick their finger. They look at the blood in their finger and they measure it and that  Tells you what your blood sugar is. It's like looking at your altimeter on an airplane, seeing what the altitude is, but there are things called continuous glucose meters, that allow you to get that information more often. I'd prick, my finger between eight and ten times a day. I've got black marks and calluses on my finger from being from doing this for 15 years. This is a sensor. These are expensive again fighting the insurance to get these things. This is going to allow me to check my blood sugar. Every five minutes. This sensor looks kind of like a mosquito has a sticker.  I needle, you'll notice that one of the things about diabetes is that there's a lot of needles and it sucks.  This is another one of those inserter deals.  Okay, take that.  Put this inside it. The little mosquito deal.  You'll find yourself as a diabetic, finding new and creative ways. Just take yourself in the irony, is you have to hurt yourself all the time while you're diabetic, so that you can avoid hurting yourself. Later. When you're old and things are going bad, put a little sticker off. See that right there. Pull the plastic off this needle.  Okay, so that needle is not going to go in me.  And this is where some of the more, the fat belly stuff's going to happen. Forgive me. I'm working out, but you're going to do and again this may look bruised and like those holes and stuff, because there is I'm putting holes in myself faster than I can.  Heal them. I'm going to take this needle.  Looking for a place where I can sets.  You hear me breathing because it hurts.  Okay. Well, the sticker.  No, that's sickening me. Pull that out.  Here's your needle.  Okay. Now that left the sensor in me.  Now, I take a battery.  This battery sitting on a charger. This is from a company called mini Majesty. It's blinking.  Put that sensor right here.  Just plugged it in.  I'll take some Second Skin. This is a kind of clear sticker. I'll take this printer sticker.  Let's take it over here.  I do this about every 36 hours.  They're waterproof, so I can leave that on now.  For a while.  So that guy sitting there, this senses, my blood sugar. Okay, that's sips sips. The interstitial fluids now at the blood with the interstitial fluids and then sends the results to this pump. Then I have to use my brain sometimes, Microsoft Excel to figure out how much insulin I want to give myself. Then I tell the pump.  But I want to give myself some insulin like to units.  It says are you sure two units? I said, yep, I'm sure.  And now it's delivering. It's a very, very slowly that little plunger that we saw before is turning and it's delivering insulin. It's going all the way through this tube and to hear this gives me information that I use to drive this. Now the fun part every three days. This is all the medical waste. Now needles got to put this in a sharp container or garbage.  Change the pump. We change the tubing. We change the reservoir. We change the needles for the continuous M. I used a hundred-and-something units of insulin got to pay for this. So, here's the part that freaks me out. And here's why I'm doing this video in the first place. I'm 36 years old, and I can handle this. I didn't say that. It's fun, but I can handle it.  But imagine, if you were 7 or 9 months old or 3.  And you had to do something like this, whether it's pricking your finger 10 times a day and taking shots or whether it's a whole bunch of tubing and wires 24 hours a day.  We do it because we want to live, we do it because we want to live for kids and to be around for a long time, but it's no fun. And I would encourage you to if you can, if, you know someone who has diabetes, if you have someone you love, who has diabetes, please give money. I'm personally, raising money for the American Diabetes Association Hanselman.com, / fight, diabetes. I'm going to put a link at the bottom of this video here. That'll explain where things where you should go, if you want to give money and that money will go to  Medical research. You can read my story and hopefully start learning a little bit more about diabetes and I hope that this is a as YouTube videos is helped you out as it hurt me a little bit. Thanks a lot.\",\n",
       " 'vg8EmtWF78': \"Well, if you're among the ten percent of Americans with diabetes, you likely use a glucose meter to track the amount of sugar in your blood, but keeping track of your blood sugar level can keep you out of the doctor's office. Maybe even out of a hospital Lisa's joining us now with some of the best meters that are out there. That's right. Good morning, exercise, food medications and stress, all affect blood sugar levels. So using a home, glucose meter can help better manage diabetes, Consumer Reports just tested 29 of them and here are the best M on the market. As Abetik David di Pietro checks. His blood glucose levels several times a day to ensure that he gets the proper amount of insulin. It's check, check check. Its that's what I do. Precision is important, Consumer Reports tested 29, blood glucose meters for accuracy by comparing their results to those from a glucose. Analyzer used in medical labs. Another important consideration is the cost of the test. Strips those little strips that you put the drops of blood on to run the test. They're a big on  going expense and the cost of them can vary. Wildly. For example, this top rated glucose meter. The freestyle light is easy to use very accurate and costs just under $20, but the strips are very expensive testing four times a day. The strip's cost about twenty four hundred dollars a year. Compare that with this 15 Dollar up and up, glucose meter from Target. The same number of strips cost, far less $525. That's about two thousand dollars per year less and Consumer Reports found.  The up-and-up m is easy to use and very accurate. Another good choice. Is this 15 Dollar rely on micro from Walmart. It takes a few seconds longer to get a reading but it is also very accurate and the annual cost of the strip's is the same $525. A reminder that good health doesn't have to come at a high price Consumer Reports. Health experts say that anyone taking insulin should monitor their glucose levels frequently at home as should pregnant diabetics Consumer Reports says that you should talk to your doctor.  After about how often you should test your blood.\",\n",
       " 'vQzIzzL_lA': \"This video is a guide to using your insulin pen. This video will show you how to one use the different types of insulin pens. To choose a good injection site, three prepare for an injection and choose the right pen needle. And for do the injection. There are several different types of insulin pens. Some insulin pens are disposable with the insulin already in the pen. There is a plunger in the pen. Once it is at the end of the pen. You will need to use a new pen.  Once the pain is empty. You can throw the whole pain in your recycle bin, non-disposable, insulin pens. Some insulin pens are non-disposable. They have a reusable pain, which holds an insulin cartridge that is inserted into the pen to open and replace the insulin cartridge. Some of the non-disposable pens twist with the two parts of the pain, moving in opposite directions.  Other pens. Unscrew  the insulin cartridge is put into the pen with a smaller n going in first.  Non-disposable pens also have a plunger. Once the plunger is, at the end of the insulin cartridge. You must replace the cartridge in the pen.  Caring for your insulin pen and cartridge. Once you start using a disposable insulin pen, or a pen with the insulin cartridge. Keep them at room. Temperature, insulin is only good for 28 days at room temperature. If you have not used all the insulin, at the end of the 28 days, throw the remainder away and use a new pen or cartridge.  Insulin pens or cartridges that you are not using should be kept in the refrigerator until you need them or until they expire. Check the box. They come in for the expiry date.  All insulin pen or cartridges hold a minimum that of 300 units of insulin allowing for multiple doses. The pain dials up units of insulin. The way to dial up. The dose is by twisting the knob at the end of the pen for the novo. Non-disposable pens. You need to pull out the end before dialing.  Choosing a good injection site for adults. The abdomen is the best place to do the injection because the insulin is absorbed the same each time. Other possible sites are the thighs and buttocks. The arm is not recommended because it is very easy to inject in the muscle.  To inject in the abdomen, do not inject with into centimeters or one inch of your belly button.  There are a lot of blood vessels in this area. Do not inject with into centimeters or one inch of any bones like your hip or ribs.  Do not inject into scar tissue from injuries or surgeries.  Do not inject where there are bumps or lumps from lipo hypertrophy. Lipo, hypertrophy is damaged tissue that happens when insulin has been injected into the same area. Many times Scar Tissue occurs, Under the Skin with decreased blood flow to the area. Decreased blood flow means that if you inject in this area, the insulin will not be absorbed and will not work as good as it should.  Avoid these areas for at least three months to prevent lipo hypertrophy. Do not inject in the same area. Keep moving your injection sites. Over by one finger width, keep rotating to different areas. If you move to a new injection area, be careful of low blood sugars as your insulin may now absorb faster and work better preparing for injection.  To prepare for an injection, you will need your insulin pen and a pen needle.  Choose the right needle. The pen needle should be four to six millimeter needle. You will find the size of the needle on the tear off tab on the pen needle.  Use a new needle each time you inject next. Wash your hands before preparing for are doing the injection to reduce your chance of getting an infection.  Pull the cap off the pen and check to make sure there is enough insulin.  Check the insulin in the pen, the insulin in the pen or cartridge may be cloudy or clear. If it is a cloudy insulin. There are two types of insulin in the pen.  The insulin must be mixed so that you get the right amount of insulin to mix insulin roll, the pain between your palms, 10 times, then tip the pin 10 times. This should be done before every injection.  Pull the tab off the Pin Needle and attach it to the Pain by twisting the needle clockwise until it is tight.  Remove the two caps from the needle.  Dial up 2 units.  Push the bottom of the pen to release the air from the needle. Look for a drop of the insulin. On the end of the needle. If there is no insulin dial up another two units, and push the bottom again. Repeat these steps until you see insulin at the end of the needle.  Dial up the dose of insulin. You will inject.  Doing the injection first. Put the Needle in your skin straight in, not at an angle. If you're very thin you might need to pinch your skin and lift it up to prevent the injection from going into the muscle.  Inject the insulin by pushing the button, at the bottom of the pen, all the way in, check to make sure the dial goes to zero.  Count to 10 while leaving the needle in place. So that you will get all of the insulin. You will know if you didn't leave the needle in long enough. If your skin is wet or you smell insulin.  Remove the needle from your skin.  Recap the needle using the larger outer cap. Turn it to the left to remove the needle.  Throw the needle in a Sharps container or glass container with a lid. Never put the needle into your regular garbage.  Do not store the pain with the needle attached, as are can be pulled into the pain. If the room temperature changes, this video has shown you the different types of insulin pens, how to choose a good injection site, how to prepare for an injection and choose the right pen needle, how to give yourself an injection. If you have any questions on how to use your insulin pen, talk to your healthcare provider.  Go to the company website or look at the instruction manual for your insulin pen.\",\n",
       " 'Jvtb0a2RXaY': \"Technically, I'll just meet. Yeah, you could say that. What Makes Us human is our emotions or thoughts or memories, but physically, we're not all that different from this. We're used to thinking, of meat is the muscle tissue that people cook and eat, but the fact is, you can eat that stuff. Raw a chicken breast or steak or a pork chop is tender enough that it doesn't need cooking. What does need cooking is all the connective tissue that's in and around the muscle and gets in the way of our meal. So one of the main reasons humans began to roast and boil and bake meet in the first place was to break down those.  Active tissues that we can't do so we can get the meat now. You might have noticed that connective tissues kind of seem like a grab bag of materials that don't really fit in other groups are muscle nervous and epithelial tissue types are more uniform. More obviously grouped together sometimes our connective tissues, just seemed like the leftovers. You throw in the stew pot but appearances are deceiving and our inability. As a species. To tolerate these tissues in our food, is just one reminder that no matter how different tendon bone, or a hunk of fat may appear, they are indeed very  Closely related, they all spring from the same embryonic cells and their structures are dominated, not by cells, but by an extracellular Matrix, full of fibers, if those fibers that have given human is the most trouble and our meeting history. It wasn't until we figured out how to cook the stuff that we were able to denature or change the natural structure of those protein fibers so that they became soft and pliable. Take a chicken. For example, you couldn't just pull the skin off a living bird. Like ethically, you couldn't do that. But also you probably could. It's living skin is anchored by  Connective tissue that's full of collagen fibers. But if you roast that chicken and break apart that college, and suddenly the skin just peels right off with no effort at all. So, connective tissues as evidenced by this mess. Here are good reminders of how sometimes things are more similar than they appear. They're also delicious if you're into that.  So we know what our connective tissues have in common and we know that we've got four different types. But what do they look like? What do they do? And where are they found both in your butcher shop and on your body, perhaps, your most diverse type is your classic connective tissue proper. It comes in both loose and dense subclasses, based on how many fibers it has in its ground substance. On the back of your hand that fleshy tent. There. That's one example of loose connective tissue. There's a lot of ground substance in here and the last, and fibers help it snap back into place while the college.  It helps anchor it so you can't like snag your skin on a zipper and watch it. Just fly off the try. Pulling on your Achilles tendons. Are these winged tendons here and there isn't a lot of give that's because the tendon is an example of dense. Connective tissue with a lot more collagen, you could chew and chew and chew on a collagen dense, tendon and never get anywhere. That's why butchers trim off most dense connective tissue before selling cuts of meat. So loose, connective tissues, have fewer fibers and more cells. And more ground substance areolar tissue is the most commonly  loose connective tissue. You have found all over your body just under your epithelial tissue and wrapped around your organs. It's got a loose random arrangement to fibers with just a few fibroblast cells that make those fibers. If you look at it under a microscope, you'll see that it's most obvious feature is that it looks like it has a lot of open space in it. This makes areolar tissue great at holding a watery. Salty ground substance that surrounding tissues. Draw from your adipose tissue. Meanwhile is your fat tissue the loose connective tissue, that's in here, rather than being mostly ground substance. This one is,  Cells adipocytes which store lipids for later. Use insulate, the body against heat loss and grow pot bellies. And love handles. The average person's weight is about 18% out of us tissue. And it's those fat stories that Keep Us Alive when food is scarce with no fat stores. You die within a few days of your last sandwich reticular tissue is like areolar tissue, but with a woven massive reticular fibers rather than collagen and elastin fibers. And the name, this tissue provides the soft internal framework or stroma of the spleen. Lymph nodes and bone marrow, and it supports lots of  Developing blood cells. Just as your areolar tissue is a kind of sponge for watery ground substance. Your reticular tissue is what holds your blood in place in many of your organs. Really all of these loose connective tissue, proper types, share an Airy dispersal of fibers, which is why they're easier to eat after cooking and why you can pull cooked chicken skin. Apart, on the other hand. You can't easily rip a tendon or a ligament into or even chew it because it's made of that dense regular tissue full of tight, bundles of collagen fibers. All running parallel. You can see how neat and  Move, the slide sample looks under a scope, the fibers being, those white flexible structures. They provide great resistance to attention when that tension is exerted in One Direction. That's why you find this tissue and your tendons, which connect muscle to Bone or other muscle and your ligaments, which bind bones together anywhere. You got a joint one of those. Collagen fibers aren't all stacked regularly in rows. Then it forms dense irregular tissue whose fibers are thicker and arranged erratically, it's found wherever tension might be exerted in lots of different.  Directions, like the leathery dermis, underlying your skin. And finally, your body has places that require more elasticity than rigidity, like, say around your joints. That's where you'll find dense. Elastic tissue, for example, connecting your vertebra. So that your spine can curve and twist. Some of our largest artery. Walls are made of this stretchy elastic tissue to which provides both support and flexibility from fad to tendons. Connective tissue. Proper is the most diverse group in this tissue family, but for the last few minutes, you've also been watching a different type of connective tissue.  You bob up and down as I talk cartilage. Cartilage doesn't have any blood her nerves, and it stands up against both tension and compression pretty well. It's that whitish gristle. You see, at the end of pork, ribs or chicken wings in your Grocers freezer. And another thing that you're not going to have much luck toing, hyaline cartilage is the most common type, its kind of glassy looking and provides pliable. Support it connects to your ribs to your sternum and keeps the tip of your nose. All perky, its ground substance is Rich with those sticky starchy proteoglycans and all.  Although it has collagen fibers. When you look at it under a scope. You can't really see them. Instead the tissue looks glassy. Hence the name Heil meaning glassy or transparent. Elastic cartilage is very similar to hyaline. But with more elastic fibers that are easier to see and it's found in places where strength and stretch ability are needed like, it's why I can pull on my ear without it ripping off and just as your body needs firm parts and stretchy Parts. It also needs shock absorbers. That's where your fibrocartilage comes in. It's dominated by thick. Fibers of collagen and is good.  Standing lots of pressure. So it makes up the discs between your vertebrae and your knee joints where it keeps your bones from grinding together. And speaking of Bones. Although you might not think of something so hard and durable. As living tissue bones. Definitely are weird. Bone can refer to an entire organ, like your femur or scapula or just bone tissue and that bone or osseous tissue was just calcified connective tissue. Perfect for supporting and protecting your body's various structures. Spongy, bone tissue is typically found in the heads of long bones and in the  Inner layer of flat bones. Like the sternum, this spongy tissue is strong, but porous even to the naked eye and it uses this extra room to make and store bone marrow. Compact bone tissue, on the other hand, is quite dense with no visible spaces. It forms the external layer of your bones and stores. Calcium for bone cells. To use to make more tissue of bone doesn't conjure up. Your traditional image of the tissue. Blood probably doesn't either. I mean, it doesn't seem to connect things or lend support and yet blood is our fourth type of connective tissue. When you think about it.  Clearly does connect distant parts of your body and provide some rigidity to other parts, just like other connective tissues, blood develops from mesenchyme and is made up of cells surrounded by an extracellular non-living Matrix. In this case. The ground substance is your blood plasma, which has protein fibers floating around in it. Your Bloods mean, job, of course is delivering Goods. It transports cells and nutrients and hormones and wastes and all kinds of other stuff. Keeping all the parts of your body connected in the process. Most of your blood cells are erythrocytes or your famous.  Red blood cells that Zoom around carrying oxygen and carbon dioxide through your body. You've also got larger infection-fighting white blood cells or leukocytes in the mix and your platelets, the small cell fragments needed for blood clotting. So that a paper cut doesn't bleed you dry. Unlike other connective tissues. It doesn't really have what you would call fibers, but instead has a bunch of protein, dissolved in the plasma, and those protein molecules will form fiber-like structures when your blood needs to clot. So, you take your four primary types of tissues.  And all of the subtypes of each that's taken us weeks to explore. And you can probably see how they can come together in many, many combinations to form. All of your body's organs and just like that chaotic cafeteria pack with middle schoolers would be a hopeless messes without our hierarchy, of organization, our inner and outer boundaries and the ability of our systems to communicate with each other. That is what our tissues do for us, and we wouldn't exist without them today. We wrapped up our four episode series on tissues with a survey of the subgroups of loose and  Connective tissue, including areolar, adipose reticular tendons, ligaments, dense, irregular and dense elastic tissue. We also talked about the three cartilage types of spongy and compact bone, connective tissue, and how and why? Our blood is also a connective tissue type.

       " 'wD7bJrYH6U': \"If you've had a urinary tract infection before, you know, they're annoying you have to start running to the bathroom or it hurts to pee and somehow you have to get antibiotics. Now UTIs are usually caused by bacteria. And so antibiotic should solve the problem. If you have symptoms do not go away with antibiotics. You may actually have something called painful bladder syndrome and it's worthwhile seeing your urologist to clarify this now UTIs are most And with it because women have a short urethra, which is the to VP through and it's only about two to three centimeters in length. And it's just not that hard for bacteria to travel across a urethra and set up shop in the bladder common risk factors for UTIs includes the medical problems diabetes and kidney stones are two examples and good management of these medical problems will reduce your ability to have a UTI postmenopausal women are also more likely to get them and we'll cover that later in the video. Some of you are going to have the great Fortune of having  two or three or more UTS in a year and that can really impact your quality of life. So my question for these patients tends to be do you notice a pattern of when you get UT is flights long car rides dehydration tend to be very common because they reduce the number of times you're going to the bathroom, but the most common cause tends to be related to sex and that's just because we have a lot of bacteria between our legs there's bacteria around the anus and it's just not that hard for the mechanics of sex to push bacteria into the vagina and urethra.  Now what's really important after sex for a woman is to make sure that you urinate within 5 to 10 minutes afterwards because that'll wash the bacteria out. I know that there are some of those magazines out there that will support all sorts of rituals. But really all you need to do is urinate after sex. There's really no data to support one thing or another in terms of those rituals sex can also cause small tears in the vagina and urethra and this can reduce some of your natural defenses to fight off infection that may be because of certain positions. It might be because of lubrication.  but if you running into this problem, you'll know it because it'll burn to urinate right after you have sex like that really tells you that there are some tears in the urethra and vagina General prevention strategies for urinary tract infection include things like staying well hydrated so that you urinate every two to three hours when you urinate make sure that you wipe from vagina back towards the anus after sex do try and urinate that'll wash that bacteria out and I've had women who are really supportive of cotton underwear actually, and I think that's probably because it's  Breathable than other types of satin and the thongs or other things but I have found that one to be anecdotally helpful for my patients though. There's no research behind it. So you may do all of those things and you still may be getting UTS and that's where something like cranberry can come into play cranberry has an active ingredient that reduces the ability of bacteria to stick to your bladder wall. Now there are mixed studies on how effective cranberry is, but the studies that showed support used Ocean Spray cranberry juice cocktail  It used about 10 to 12 ounces of it daily for patients. There are a lot of cranberry pills and kremers supplements on the market and I don't tend to recommend those because you can't really check on the purity of it and what's in the ingredients and they're also very expensive and that's just because it's an unregulated market now if you don't want to use cranberry, there's another thing that's similar to it called d-mannose and d-mannose works in the same way. It reduces the ability of bacteria to stick to the bladder wall and the  Buddies that were successful with this showed about using two grams in about 200 milliliters of water daily. So that's about 8 ounces. Now if that doesn't work, you can also talk with your doctor about using something like an antibiotic either in a low-dose daily or taken just around the time when you usually get a UTI, whether it be that flight or sex or long car ride and that can reduce your ability to get infections as well for women who are postmenopausal again, the loss of estrogen reduces the strength of some of that tissue.  Shoe around the vagina and urethra, and so a vaginal estrogen cream can be really helpful in giving you some of that tissue back. Excuse me for giving you some of that tissue bulk back so that you have better natural defenses against an infection. These are a handful of the options. Please see your doctor to talk with them about what might be the best thing for you to do going forward. Thanks so much for your time.\",\n",

And if, you know, the signs to look for, then you can avoid having to deal with long hospital, visits and stays and all of that. And you can go straight to just learning to manage your blood sugar. So we are going to go through the warning signs with you guys and kind of talk through them. So that you know what? They are. Excessive thirst check. You definitely got that. Didn't you frequent urination? Yeah. What  Yeah, we were on a road trip at one point when we were like wow Aspen has to pee a lot bedwetting or heavy diaper. Nope. You don't wear diapers anymore and you weren't bedwetting. But that does happen to a lot of people Vision change in headaches. I think you had some blurred vision. Occasionally. You said that you did. Yeah. Rapid weight loss. Yes. She lost about ten pounds in about a week when it came closer to when she was diagnosed and you know, when you're as little as she  Is losing 10 pounds is a lot of weight increased appetite. Yeah, she was eating all the time and I was like, where is it going? Because it's not going to her just she's getting skinnier and eating more irritability and mood changes. I wouldn't so much say she was irritable but mood changes. Holy cow. Yes. I told John something is really wrong with Aspen. She is her moods. I can't keep up with them.  Fatigue and weakness. Shea came to me a little bit. She was like, Mom. I think Aspen's really sick. I don't know what's going on, but I asked her to play dolls with me, which Aspen would have jumped at the chance to play dolls with Shay anytime. And she told me she didn't want to play because she just wanted to take a nap. She basically was just on the couch all day, every day. Pretty much. And we thought, maybe she had like mono or something is with the doctor when we talked to him on the phone thought she might have, because she just was so lethargic.  She would walk down the stairs, get on the couch and just kind of lay there all day, stomach, pain, nausea and vomiting. She did not have nausea and vomiting but definite stomach pain. In fact, we thought she had a major gluten issue. So, we had taken her off gluten completely, which is that actually helped. It seems weird, but it's because gluten has so many carbs. So I made me go higher. Uh-huh. Fruity breath odor. What? I don't know. I didn't I didn't ever notice that what I think it means your breath smells like  Fruit fruity. Breath odor. What? It's so weird. I'm nervous that one. Yeah, apparently people who are in dka have like really sweet breath smell rapid, heavy breathing. Like she would be sitting on the couch doing nothing and just having the like  Like you could tell it was like something was not right at all. It's often mistaken for so type one, diabetes. All the signs for dka are sometimes mistaken for a stomach flu or virus. Strep throat, grow it growth spurt urinary tract infection or in our case mono. So any kind of flu like thing, you know, a lot of people think oh, well, she must just have some sort of bug. So our heart is really to help other kids, not have to go through it.  We went through, I would love to be able to get more awareness around this, so that kids are diagnosed so early that they don't ever have to go through the dka and the sickness part because they really don't have to. We had actually, when we were being educated at Barbara Davis, there was a little girl in there who had never gotten sick at all. They went in thinking, she had a urinary tract infection, I think, and she was diagnosed type one diabetic. Here. We were with like poor emaciated Aspen, who is so skinny and it  I've been in the hospital for three days. She had needle, pokes, you know, all over her and she looked awful and then this little girl just look perfectly healthy and she hadn't been sick at all. But they had found it quick enough that she didn't have to go through all that if you or someone, you know is experiencing these symptoms right now. Please go to a doctor and ask them if it could be type 1 diabetes. They can easily test and find out. If it is with either a finger prick or a urine test. We would love to be able to prevent other kids.  From having to suffer through this. And so, that's our real heart here. And we are joining with Beyond type one, who's doing a big dka awareness project and they want other people to spread the word. So that more and more people can know about this. If people just know the signs and know what to look for, this can so easily be prevented. So beyond type, one wants to send all of you guys a packet that will help spread awareness for dka. This is full of all these little  Posters for you, and actually, they're in Spanish or English, which is pretty great. We would love for you guys to get a packet like this. Take these posters. Don't just let it sit in your house because that is pointless. Take these posters and hang them up at your school. Go and ask your school. If you can hang it in the nurse's office or hang it in the hallway or take it to your doctor's office. Take it to your church, wherever you can find that you can raise awareness for. This is a really fantastic thing.  NG that we would love to partner with you guys in. So, we'll put a link below to the page on Beyond type one.org that you need to go to to get your own packet so that you can get started. The other thing you can do to spread awareness is to share this video. So if you're on Facebook, share this video on Facebook, share this video on Twitter, on Instagram, or wherever you can put a link that way. Other people can know the signs and know what to look for. And you never know who's going to be watching.  Who's going to be like? That's what's going on with my kid right now. So please share this. So that more people can know what to look for.

       " 'zeYIytL3wo': \"Sorry World IMA literature review. There have been three major studies in the literature of the past several years, fairly large studies, but retrospective totaling about 11,000 patients and, and together, they seem to demonstrate that there's about a one percent incidence of significant cerebral edema among patients, who present with dka among those who get significant cerebral edema about, 40% will die, or have a severe neurologic outcome.  If you do the math, that's a net population. Mortality of about 2.4 percent, a more recent study by a colleague of mine here at Children's, dr. De courcey looked at a Fizz database review. Fizz is an administrative database. We have access to in the US was able to look at a total of just over 37,000 DK patients in a single study. And to our surprise. We found a significant increase incidence of  Cerebral edema defined as edema that prompted therapy of either Mount or hypertonic saline by a practicing, clinician.  Four-fold increase in the incidence but a 10% mortality. So a significantly reduced mortality. And on the face, that looks like good news for treating more patients and they're doing better. But again, when one does the math, basically we haven't changed the ultimate mortality at all. We're treating four times as many patients there. One quart is 1/4 as likely to have a bad outcome and ultimately point four percent population mortality. So despite our  It is over the decades. It's not clear that we've made a Major Impact in overall mortality, but these numbers are low and it's easy to have had even a 30 or 40 percent effect on mortality. And have that really be difficult to detect with these studies risk factors for cerebral edema.  What are the known risk factors for cerebral edema? Well, again, back to a doctor. Glazer's paper from 2001 as she identified. Four major risk factors in children with significant cerebral, edema. Three of them are shown here. Hi, be un low, pco2 and treatment with bicarbonate. Now. We know that a high B 0 n is associated with someone who's dehydrated. How about a low PCO?  To that someone who has a very low ph and they're hyperventilating and dropping their pco2 so that they can blow off some of that additional acid and who gets treated with bicarbonate, those who had the lowest pH. So, although these were independent risk factors. The reality is that all three of them car, late? Really quite directly with severity of illness. And while they may be independent risk factors as clinicians. We look at patients and our message is  Is the more dehydrated, the more acidotic. They are the more at risk they are.  The fourth risk factor was the one that really kind of threw us for a loop. Fourth risk factor. If you notice demonstrates a lower relative risk, when the serum sodium Rises by more than five point, eight per hour.  The prior three risk factors. I showed you if they were true. The relative risk is increased in this case, when it's true, the relative risk decreases. What that suggests is that a serum sodium? Rise of 5.8% Our is a good thing. Now, we measure serum sodium every two hours and that would mean that we would have a change of  12, almost 12 millimoles per liter over two hour. Period. That means, patient comes in with serum. Sodium of 125. You check it again a couple hours later. It's 137. That is an extraordinary change. And as a clinician, I would posit that this is not in my experience, a degree of change in serum sodium that we see very commonly at all. So, what do we do with this risk factor, but we just does it only apply when the serum sodium Rises. So  Play that to an extent that we almost never see.  Instead, we can look at it from a little bit of a different point of view.  You come over here and look at this graph. I'll show you what I mean.  So if we look at the evolution of sodium and glucose concentrations over time, and the setting of dka, we can think about it from the point of view, of being above and below normal. So, we consider this to be the normal range.  And we start with a glucose concentration. That's quite High.  We know from our discussion, that the serum sodium will be relatively low.  And the idea in resolution of dka is that as the glucose comes down into the normal range?  The serum sodium on to rise. The reason the serum sodium is low to begin with you'll recall. Is that glucose is an osmotic Asian, the pulls water into the bloodstream, the Looting everything that's in the bloodstream. So it's going to dilute sodium. It's going to Loop potassium and chloride as well. But sodium is the most obvious, the most prominent.  And as glucose comes out of the extremely, high range into the normal range, the exact same thing ought to happen with sodium.  The risk factor that we were discussing earlier.  Is when glucose begins to come down but sodium does not come up at the same rate. The if sodium comes up a little bit and kind of flattens out that is considered the invocation of the risk factor. That sodium has not risen fast enough. And this is considered a risk factor for developing significant cerebral edema.  One way to follow the relationship between the hyperglycemia and the hyponatremia over time is to look at the corrected. Serum sodium.  One way to think about the sodium changes that we talked about are to look at a value that we referred to as the corrected, sodium corrected, sodium answers, the question. What would the serum sodium be? If glucose was normal, we use a formula to calculate this and we say we take the serum sodium and look at the serum glucose and we say how many hundreds over 100 is the serum glucose and multiply that times two.  And added to the serum sodium and we get our corrected sodium for example, serum sodium is 125 and the blood sugar is 900. Well, that's 800 over 100. So 8 times 2 is 16. We add 16 to the 125. We get 141. The so the corrected sodium in this example is 141. While the measured sodium is 125.  Question that's often asked in this situation is, which is real, which is the real serum sodium.  The answer is very definitively that the serum sodium is 125. The sodium that the brain is seeing its 125.  What would the sodium be if the glucose was normal 141? But the glucose is a normal, the glucose is 900. And so right now, the serum sodium is quite low.  The way we use the measured, the way we use the corrected sodium to think about this risk factor is to say the corrected. Sodium should be normal and stay normal. If as we saw in the graph the glucose comes down and the serum sodium does not rise adequately that should be reflected in a corrected sodium. That is low. So if there were corrected sodium drops below,  In 138, we really need to get ourselves to the bedside. Do a thorough neurological exam and determine whether or not. This patient has symptoms of significant cerebral edema and think about treating it that point, but this risk factor is really only present when the serum sodium does not rise sufficiently. Now, you may ask, why would why would I not just give sodium?  Well, there's nothing, I don't have any data to suggest that one should not treat this scenario with sodium, but I will tell you that every study has ever looked at rate of Civility and Administration has not found it to be predictor of significant cerebral edema. We are Physicians and when something is low and it's a bad sign, then our inclination is to treat it to bring it up.  The best example, the best analogy I could think of is a patient with meningitis. Let's just say that eight-year-old has meningitis. And as a CSF, white count of ten thousand now, you know that a high CSF white count is very as a very poor prognosticator and a significant risk factor. I will give you the choice. You can either treat this patient with Ceftriaxone or you can plasma for plasmapheresis the CSF, which are you going to choose?  You're going to choose this after an axon because you understand that. The problem here is that there are bacteria that are eating part of the brain and causing a massive amount of inflammation that is putting the patient at risk for severe outcome. The white cells are only a symptom of the underlying. Pathology. I would posit to you. That, that is really the exact same thing that's going on here. When the sodium fails to rise. Normally it is not the problem. It is a symptom of the problem and it is very  likely connected to inappropriate ADH. Secretion that is triggered by an injured, brain and a brain that is becoming\",\n",
       " 'k1qtkFqQDBs': \"Bum hematopoietic stem cells. These develop into Pro B cells. Those imagine products themselves that instead of becoming a mast cell or in stead of becoming a dendritic cell, those that are going to become B cells, initially become throw B cells. The next stage in their development is to become a 3, B cell, then they develop into immature b-cells. And of course, eventually  Ali into mature b cells.  There are two stages in this development process where these B cells undergo very very extensive cell division. In other words proliferation. That's a very early stage in their maturation at the stem cell, probie cell stage, and then later on at the pre, be immature, b-cells stage. They undergo further massive rounds of proliferation. They dividing all the time, but these two stages in their development are characterized by  By particularly extensive cell proliferation.  There are two genes that are called rag1 and rag2 stands. For recombination activating genes already mentioned that the immunoglobulin genes in the b-cell, undergo recombination to create diversity. These recombination activating genes obviously play a role in that as their name suggests, and these genes are also expressed at two different points in the development.  And maturation of B cells at the pro b3b stage and then they can become re-expressed later on in immature b-cells to fine-tune the antigen receptor on the be. So there's another molecule which will hear about shortly called tdt. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl. Transferase bit of a mouthful that isn't it. We normally just refer to it as T DT because terminal deoxynucleotidyl.  Title transfer case. It's quite long word to say. So T DT and that's expressed again at the stage between Pro B cells and T B cells.  If we look at the immunoglobulin gene DNA in the B cell and the RNA that's produced from that DNA in the stem cell stage and the probe East else cell stage. These immunoglobulin genes are what we call in the germline configuration. That means how these genes are inherited through the sperm and the Egg the germline, and every single cell in the body wall.  I have this DNA just like you have genes for all the different genes you have in all the different cells and in all the cells in the body. They will be in the germline orientation or configuration and it's only once cells develop to become B cells that these immunoglobulin genes recombine.  And this recombination initially starts off at the pre B cell stage and some segments within the heavy chain genes for the immunoglobulins because immunoglobulins consists of a heavy chain. And unlike chain, the first event that says, hmmm that cell, that sells going to become a b-cell is when the b-cell recombines. It's heavy chain genes and it recombines, three Gene segments as we will see shortly.  They that called the D and J, variable diversity, and joining. Once that recombination process has occurred in the pre b-cell. Messenger RNA is produced for the heavy chain and that includes a segment that is from the constant region called Mew. So, you get mu mRNA in the PB cell.  As that cell, then develops to the final stage before full maturity. In other words, the immature B, Sol the recombined, heavy chain, Gene Associates, the product of that Gene Associates with the product of a recombined, light chain, Gene, didn't the light chains. The V Gene segments and J. Gene segments that recombine produced a lie.  Chain protein. So now we have IG for the DNA that's recombined in the heavy chain and the light chain. We have a mu heavy chain protein and either a cap up or Lambda light chain protein produced from the capital Lambda messenger RNA, and then finally, we end up via alternative. Splicing of the VD + J with the constant region of  The IGM antibody, which is encoded by a seam Eugene OR the igd antibody encoded by a c. Delta G.  so, the stage of maturation,  Early on the immunoglobulin genes are not the combined to there's no expression. In order to express these jeans. They need to be recombined. They only recombining B cells and they only recombine at the PB cell stage. So you start off at the PB cell stage with the first indication that this cell is going to become a b-cell. It has cytoplasmic Mew heavy chain and on the surface it has what is called the pre b-cell receptor.  She's a surrogate light chain. It's not the top of the light chain, but it's a sort of intermediate light chain. That's produced to put together with them you heavy chain. And then once the light chain genes have been recombined, you get the full mature antibody molecule on the surface of this immature B cell. So it's amateur antibody, but it's on the surface of an immature B cell and this is membrane IGM.  And then, as well as IGN, another class of antibody the igd class is put on the surface of the mature b cells as well as having antibodies on their cell surface. B cells have thousands of other molecules on the cell surface, just like every every cell does and we can use certain molecules on the surface of B cells to identify which stage in maturation. They are. So, for example, the molecule CD 43,  Is present on the surface of the stem cells? It's also present on the surface of the probe ezel. But additional molecules become expressed such as cd19 and CD 10.  And then, as those pre B cells, develop into pre B cells, there is low expression of a molecule called be 220. CD 43 is still there. But as that TB cell develops into an immature B cell, the expression of CD4 T 3 is lost. So if a cell has a molecule on its surface, we described it as a CD, whatever, positive cell. If it doesn't have expression. We describe it as a  D whatever - cell. So in other words the stem cells, the probie cells and the T B cells are CD, 43 positive. Whereas the immature B cell is CD 43 - because it is lost expression of CD 43 at that stage of the immature B cell. There is a low level expression of IGM antibodies, on the surface of the B cell. And then as the b-cell, further matures to become a fully mature b-cell, the  level of expression of our GM increases.  So where are these different types of b-cell? These different stages of maturation found? Well the stem cells, the probie cells, the p b cells are all within the bone marrow and then as the cells, develop into immature b-cells, they can leave the bone marrow and enter what immunologists refer to as the periphery rather strange term. That the proof lie simply means anywhere outside of the primary lymphoid tissues. So anywhere in the body that isn't the  Own marrow or the thymus immunologists refer to as the periphery and the mature. B cells are found in the peripheral move to the periphery.  The response to antigen clearly, if the B cell doesn't have an antigen receptor on the surface. It can't respond. It has no way of responding to antigen. So because there is no surface antibody on stem cells, probie cells, or pre B cells. There's no response to antigen at the immature b-cells stage when there is low level expression of IGM. The B cells can undergo what is called negative selection, or deletion. And this refers to the fact that if  Those B cells encounter molecules form our own body. What we call Self antigen, then they become deleted because we don't want B cells and can attack our own body components. We want these cells that can fight infection coming from outside the body. So they'll be deletion of B cells that recognize self antigen and there can be receptor editing. And this is why rag1 and rag2 get re-expressed at this stage, so that the receptor can be changed. If it reacts with self, it can be.  Changed to a different receptor that reacts with a foreign pathogen rather than reacting with self. And then once they're mature, of course, the b-cells are fully able to respond to engine. I mean, that's how it should be. Obviously, you need the B cells to be able to respond and they can become activated. They completely 48 divided up in number and they can differentiate and become specialized, particularly become specialized to produce, a progeny of the B cell that is called a plasma cell and what plasma cells  Is they secrete very large amounts of antibody of the same specificity that acts as the b-cell receptor on the surface of the b-cell. So, in the bone marrow, we have these pre B cells, this early stage of development and they have on their cell surface, not a mature form of the antibody molecule, but a preliminary version. If you like the antibody molecule, where you have the normal version of the  GM heavy chain, which is called New heavy chain, but it's not a mature version of the light chain. They have what we refer to as a surrogate light chain and this is made up of two components. One is called V3 be\",\n",

       " 'k_wNE4erBLU': \"This new finding comes from a research article, published by the achiely lab at Columbia University in cell journal, in September 2012. It is titled pancreatic beta cell dedifferentiation is a mechanism of diabetic beta cell failure.  These scientists study type 2 diabetes or insulin resistant. Diabetes Type 2, diabetes makes up about 90 percent of all cases of diabetes.  One of the main causes of type 2 diabetes is obesity because rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes have increased substantially over the past 50 years. It is important to understand the underlying biology at the level of the cell in order to engineer the next generation of Therapeutics.  In order to understand type 2 diabetes, let's focus on the pancreas. The important molecule. We are going to talk about is insulin when a glucose in the form of sugar or starch is consumed by an individual. Insulin is produced by the pancreas by cells called beta cells.  Insulin causes the cells to take up and store glucose to reduce glucose levels in the blood.  So what happens in type 2 diabetic patients? Well these patients experience something called insulin resistance. This happens when the body cannot properly, use the insulin to store away glucose as a result glucose accumulates and the beta cells in the pancreas. Keep secreting more and more insulin to try and lower the blood glucose level.  This causes a lot of stress on the beta cell and eventually the patient experiences beta cell failure, where the pancreas is no longer able to produce insulin, and blood glucose remains High.  This paper, addresses, the issue of beta cell failure and tries to understand why beta cells become unable to produce insulin.  To start talking about this finding. Let's understand where beta cells. Come from.  Beta cells. Come from stem cells that we call progenitor cells. That are specialized in producing a variety of cells for the pancreas.  What happens is it? Progenitor cell will divide and those cells had produced will undergo a process called differentiation where they become beta cells, that produce insulin or other cell types in the pancreas. What's important to know is that this is a one-way street, so beta cells cannot make stem cells.  Before this finding came out there was much controversy in the field. Trying to understand why beta cells can no longer produce insulin in type 2 diabetic patients.  Some scientists thought that the beta cells died more quickly than they were replenished, which caused net reduction in the number of cells that produce insulin.  But what this paper is showing is something a little different.  In this paper, the author's are using a mouse model of type 2 diabetes, the develops beta cell failure.  What the authors did is looked at? What happens to the beta cells over time when a mouse experiences beta cell failure?  To do this, they engineered the mouse so that all beta cells that made insulin Wear Yellow. If a beta cell loses its ability to make insulin, it turns green. So now they are able to answer their question. What causes beta cell failure, and what happens to the beta cells?  If beta cells were dying more quickly than you cells were being made, as was previously, thought the number of yellow cells would go down and there would be no green cells.  But that is not what they saw in contrast. The authors saw that the number of green cells was actually going up with beta cell failure.  This means that beta cells were losing their ability to make insulin.  The beta cells weren't dying at all, but they were changing into cells that don't produce insulin.  So what are these new green cells? Well, it turns out that these new green cells are actually, progenitor cells, the same progenitor cells that normally produce beta cells.  The beta cells undergoing beta cell failure, have gone back in time to become the progenitor cells. That produce them.  This process is called dedifferentiation, but it had never before shown to occur in response to beta cell failure. So this is very exciting. What's even more exciting is that these green D differentiated cells are then able to make a variety of different cells for the pancreas?  So, this finding is very interesting for a number of reasons. Number one. It provides a new understanding of the causes of type 2 diabetes. That was not previously known. Number two. It suggests that there is no loss of cells, in type 2 diabetes. So these new progenitor cells may still have the ability to turn back into beta cells and reverse beta cell failure to maybe cure type 2 diabetes.  So what did this study show this study showed that during beta cell failure which causes type 2 diabetes beta cells that normally make insulin. Do you differentiate to become the progenitor cells that created them?  These new progenitor cells. Now have the ability to produce other cells for the pancreas. This finding is very exciting. But when thinking about therapies for type 2 diabetes, it is still very preliminary. The author's use a mouse model for type 2 diabetes. So it's not clear. If this is also, what happens in humans during type 2, diabetes, development, or even in a different Mouse model of type 2 diabetes, as you can see, scientists are always trying to rethink the status quo.  Bow to gain knowledge and learn the truth about the causes of diseases to develop more efficient and targeted Therapies.\",\n",
       " 'kaoRrzakjGE': \"In this video, we're going to learn about enzyme-linked receptors. Like also May mean receptors enzyme-linked receptors receive signals from the environment and they instruct the cell to do certain things like most, enzyme-linked receptors are transmembrane proteins, but they are unique. Because in addition to receiving signals from chemical Messengers. They also function as enzymes binding of a signaling molecule activates the receptors enzymatic, activity enzyme.  Times are a substance in our body that act as a catalyst, which can speed up particular, biochemical reactions. Enzyme-linked receptors are also called catalytic receptors. So over here, I've pre-drawn a picture of our cell membrane. Is there a phospholipid bilayer up top? I'm going to say, this is our extracellular environment.  And below is our intracellular environment. This is inside our cell or cytosol, and all of our organelles are located.  Let's talk a little bit about the structure of enzyme-linked receptors. So the general structure of enzyme-linked receptors are shaped like this up top here. You can see there is a shape which can bind a ligand. This over here is our ligand binding. Domain start extrasolar portion down here, this half of the protein on the intracellular side is our enzymatic. Domain. It's our functional domain. This is the part of the enzyme-linked receptors that can  Act as an enzyme. So when we have a ligand up here and when it binds in, so the extracellular side, combine, the Ligon which will cause the intracellular side to act as an enzyme.  Though, there are many different types of enzyme-linked receptors the most widely recognized, and most common. Enzyme-linked receptors are called receptor tyrosine, kinases. They're particularly important because they regulate cell growth, differentiation and survival. They can bind and respond to ligands such as growth factors. These are also called rtks for short. The structure and function of r TK is aren't really a mystery. It really is right in the name. Part of the reason why,  Scepter tyrosine kinases are unique is because they have tyrosine. So if we go ahead and draw out a receptor like this.  Their unique because tyrosine is on the intracellular enzymatic section. So we can entire scene like this. So now that we've addressed to tyrosine portion of the name. What do you suppose a kinase maintenance? Well, a kindness is a general term for something that has the ability to transfer phosphorus molecules. Usually from a high-energy substance, like ATP. So receptor tyrosine kinases have the ability to transfer phosphorus.  ATP to intracellular proteins, which activates them, that's the enzymatic function of receptor tyrosine. Kinase has to transfer these phosphorus molecules these proteins, which are now. Phosphorylated can carry out a message through signal transduction. Now, let's talk a little bit in more detail about this particular process. We'll talk about why in a second but receptor tyrosine kinases occur in pairs.  So if you can find one receptor tyrosine, kinase, you'll find another one. That's fairly nearby. Okay? And down here, we have our tires scene.  So out here, we have our extracellular signal. Now. Let's say that this signal is now binding into that, leg and binding site. What's unique about receptor. Tyrosine, kinases is that these two pairs are going to come together and act together. So let's go ahead and draw these two pairs close together like this. Okay. So at this point, our ligand is bound. We have our tyrosine on the bottom here, so when it's signaling,  Binds to an RT K. They cause neighboring RT case to associate with each other forming what we call a cross-linked dimer. So this new thing that's formed. When these two come together is a cross-linked dimer.  R TK is need to act in pairs. Now. The reason why is because cross-linking activates to tyrosine kinase activity in these rtks through. Phosphorylation. So now these tyrosine are active and they can start getting phosphorus, has each rtk in the dimer, phosphorylates. The tire scenes on the other rtk. There aren't always two tires, seems there usually are multiple ones for the sake of clarity. I've only drawn into the  This process of one phosphorylating, the other is called cross phosphorylation. So if we have a teepee inside the cell, these Tire scenes will cause it to become a DP with a phosphate group, this tyrosine molecule. Now that we have our cross link, dimer is going to go ahead and pick up this free-floating, phosphate group. So now at a certain point, each one of these each, one of the tire scenes are going to get a phosphate group.  Group from ATP. Again. The reason why they need to act in pairs as because one receptor tyrosine, kinase will phosphorylate the other one. Once cross phosphorylated the intracellular, cytoplasmic section. So the enzymatic section of these rtks, serve as docking platforms for different intracellular, proteins involved in signal transduction. So once we have these phosphorus has on the tyrosine different, proteins can come by.  And attach themselves to them. So for example, we can have one type of protein and we could also have another type of protein. They don't have to be the same one.  Now, the only thing that these proteins really need to have to dock with the phosphorus is a special domain, specifically called sh2. This can bind to these phosphorylated tyrosines again, multiple different sh2. Containing proteins can bind at the same time to any of these phosphorus. So we've only drawn proteins on this one side, but the same or different proteins can also bind. On the other side, this allows activation of multiple different in  Or cellular signaling Pathways at the same time. Now, after that, the signaling process can be really complex and often. It can even end at the nucleus, which affects Gene transcription. And so here, now that we have our proteins bound. We're going to have our signal transduction. So the signal is going to be passed on into them into the cytosol. And ultimately, this often ends in regulating Gene transcription, which ultimately affects the production of proteins.  What are TK's actually, do in our body enzyme-linked receptors in general, have a variety of functions? But receptor tyrosine. Kinase is again, are one of the most famous and most well-known enzyme-linked receptors. And these are primarily known for their role in growth factors, such as in regulating surface, proteins called efrain's, which can help guide developmental processes involved in tissue architecture placement of nerve endings and and blood vessel maturation.  Other growth factors including things like nerve, growth factors and platelet, derived growth factors. Also use our TK's. Another thing that are TK's are famous for is they can also bind hormones, most famously insulin. Now what happens, when rtks fail to function properly. Well since rtk is primarily regulate cell growth, they can cause issues in the growth and differentiation of cells, if they're not working, in fact, because of this many cancers involved, mutations,  TK's for this reason, our decays are actually a target of many drugs that are used in chemotherapy. For example, the breast cancer drugs herceptin is an antibody that binds and inhibits a particular rtk. That is overexpressed in many different breast cancers. So in summary enzyme-linked receptors essentially turn and extracellular. Chemical signal into enzyme activity inside the cell. Specifically, the most well, known of  Those are receptor tyrosine kinases and these are the largest and most well-known group, The Binding of a signaling molecule in rtk activates tyrosine kinase in the cytoplasmic section of the receptor. This activity then can launch a series of many different enzymatic. Reactions. It can bind different proteins which ultimately undergo complicated signal transduction. Generally carrying the signal to the nucleus, which can then alter gene expression.\",\n",
       " 'kb146Y1igTQ': \"Here's a couple of words, you might find useful in the study of human metabolism. They also happen to be two words that I enjoy in general, runch buffet. I'd throw in all-you-can-eat, but that's kind of implied. And then it would be six words unless you hyphenate them, but still brunch buffet. You got eggs and bacon and french toast and biscuits, and fruit. And some kind of weird sorted, Jello thing in there. And once you've paid your 1299, you know, there's a pretty good chance that it's all gonna get eaten, but here's the thing, not everything that you fit into your face. During brunch time is going to be handled the same way.  Way by your body after you're done digesting, some nutrients will go straight to your body's pile of stuff to burn right away, but others will have to be converted into something else. For example, the carbs and fats in your buttered toast can be directly oxidized into usable energy, but the amino acids in the bacon have to be converted into molecules that get broken down like carbs if you want to get energy out of them and well excess carbs and fats can be stored in larger polymer versions of their original forms, and the extra amino acids can't be. They have to be converted and then stored as fat or glycogen. So as I've been  Before the molecules in your body, are constantly changing shape, and renewing, and rearranging themselves to either build things or to use energy and eating food replenishes. These nutrients, especially glucose, then depending on what your body needs, and when you last ate certain hormones, like, insulin will help decide what to burn and what to store for later. This, of course, is unimportant function, which is why things can go badly. If this process doesn't work properly because of a metabolic disorder like diabetes, in that case, your body can't properly use and store nutritional energy, which makes  The very Act of eating and metabolizing more difficult and possibly dangerous. Exactly. How glucose levels can Spike or plummet how we convert nutrients into energy, and how all that relates to eating, and hunger and weight metabolism, and your health in? General is guess what complicated? But as you are a living thing that must eat in order to stay alive. I'd say, it's worth Learning How It Works. Brunch is as good, a place to start as any  Waiting in line. For the all-you-can-eat brunch, buffet is a good time to recall, the law of conservation of energy law, simply states, that energy can never be created or destroyed. It can only change forms in the process of metabolism involves conversions of energy, either through catabolize in reactions that release the energy stored in your food or anatta lysing, ones that use or store that energy. So  You can enjoy your short stack of Flapjacks and biscuits and gravy. But remember that energy has to either get released or stored somewhere inside you. Now, the conversion of food energy is part of the Great balancing act that is maintaining homeostasis. And one of its greatest tricks is cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is how we derive energy from the food. We eat specifically glucose, which is where most of our food ends up in order for glucose to become energy, we can use, we have to give it some oxygen, and convert each sugar molecule into six molecules of CO2 and six molecules of water.  Which usually produces about 32 molecules of ATP, cellular respiration occurs in three, simultaneous phases? Where glucose is broken down by glycolysis and other catabolic reactions. And then turned into pyruvic acid and acetyl Co a and finally ushered into the Krebs cycle. It's all pretty complicated, but we covered it extensively in Crash Course biology. So rather than getting into the blow-by-blow here, I recommend you check out that video for a refresher for now. Just remember that cellular respiration breaks down, nutrient molecules to generate ATP and in doing so it captures  Some of the chemical energy that was in those bonds for use in your body. Now when it comes to how that energy is converted and where that depends largely on. When you ate your last meal, we all switch back and forth between two nutritional States, the absorptive or fed state, which is during, or after eating and the post absorptive or fasting State. When the GI tract is empty in the body is running off of stored supplies. So say you're just post brunch buffet and you're still in the absorptive state done. Buckling, your belt is your digestive system, breaks up the eggs and bacon and French.  And syrup into a bunch of mostly glucose molecules that pass into your bloodstream. The first bit of glucose gets delivered throughout the body and is tapped to generate ATP on the spot through cellular respiration. But since the meal was Big and Rich, there's more glucose floating around than your cells need at the moment. And remember, ATP is too unstable to be used for storage, which means all the extra glucose is going to get stored as fat or glycogen and that storage is part of how you can end up gaining weight to guys how much energy gets stored. Depends partly on your basal metabolic rate. That's the number of daily calories.  Raise your body needs to do business as usual. And that rate can be influenced by your age or sex and body size or composition. A young bodybuilder is going to burn way more calories than that. Tiny Grandma. But generally, if you're absorbing more nutrients than you're burning, you will gain weight. So you have for that, you can blame the law of conservation of energy. Now, of course, all nutrients are important. I mean, your body is basically made of protein. So that's kind of the key, but in terms of immediate fuel, glucose is the easiest source of food for cells, like your neurons, and it is always a good policy to keep your brain. Well,  I fed so it doesn't get hangry or dead. So your body likes to maintain a blood glucose level of 70 to 100 milligrams per deciliter. Let's say that thanks to the buffet. You've now, got 140 milligrams per deciliter. This means too much sugar is swimming around in your blood and your body isn't happy about it. If your blood sugar levels, get too high, it can damage, blood vessels, especially those in the nervous, system, heart kidneys, eyes and extremities. That's why diabetes is often associated with a higher risk of heart and kidney disease, loss of vision and foot amputation, but typically,  Rising blood sugar levels sets off a series of events that trim them back down pacifically. They trigger special beta cells in the pancreas to start secreting more of the hormone that regulates everything that happens when you're in the absorptive state. And this hormone is the all-powerful insulin, insulins job in this instance, is to move glucose out of the blood and into storage and to do that, it triggers a shift from catabolic reactions to anabolic one. For example, it puts a stop to glycogenolysis or breaking down glycogen in your liver and muscles to release glucose for energy. And instead.  Ed ramps up the process of glycogenolysis where extra glucose is linked together to form. Glycogen. It also activates lipogenesis were very cool chemical reactions in the liver converts glucose to triglycerides and then ship them off to your adipose tissue for storage similar thing. Happens with the extra fatty acids that you got from the eggs. And bacon, that aren't immediately needed for energy. They get processed through lipogenesis to, and are rebuilt back into triglycerides and then tucked away for a rainy day. The thing is, if you thinking about this all these lipids hate water, right? Fat and water don't mix. So you should be asking  Yourself, how can they be transported in the blood when they're so hydrophobic? The answer is lipoproteins for specialized proteins made by the liver that surround fats and allow them to move in the bloodstream as an Emulsion. You've probably heard of some of these one is low density lipoprotein. Also known as LDL cholesterol. It's what delivers some of the glucose and fat that you just ate to your body's fat deposits. Another is high density lipoprotein or HDL cholesterol, which is the good cholesterol. It starts out as an empty protein packet sent out by the liver to  I gather up other cholesterol from the blood and artery walls and other cells HDL. Then delivers the cholesterol back to the liver or two places like the ovaries testes and adrenal glands, which use it to make steroid hormones. All right. So now your body is put all the glucose and lipids and proteins where they need to go. And you can just Coast into the post absorptive State took several hours later, even though your small intestine is still working on what's left of the buffet. Your cells have been helping themselves to the remaining glucose in the blood and eventually, your blood sugar level will start to drop the number. Your neurons are.  On an exclusive glucose meal plan, so they need sugar at the ready. And if your body senses, an imbalance in blood sugar levels, it sounds the alarm a decrease in glucose stimulates alpha cells in the pancreas to release. Insulin is Nemesis the hormone glucagon. It starts, raising the blood sugar level by triggering, the liver and adipose tissues to metabolize. They're fat and glycogen stores. Thereby releasing fatty acids, glycerol and glucose back into the blood. But if it's been a day or two since you've eaten for some reason, and you've burned through both your blood  goes and your glycogen stores and you don't have any sugars left to feed your brain and not case your body will launch into gluconeogenesis and convert fats and amino acids into glucose. So ATP synthesis can continue in your brain cells. This process is a sort of last-ditch effort by the body to protect the nervous system from the damaging effects of low blood sugar. Now, of course this whole system has its flaws and one of them is that the whole setup is almost entirely dependent on the proper release and reception of insulin people with diabetes either, don't produce enough insulin or have abnormal receptors for  Which is why they often have to inject a pharmaceutical version of the chemical after eating otherwise, their blood sugar levels will remain too high and they'll start peeing out, large amounts of glucose to try and balance the levels in the blood problem is because glucose is being excreted and not stored. It's not available when the blood sugar starts to drop. So the body has to draw on fat and protein tissues for energy, which is one reason why sudden weight loss can be an early sign of diabetes whether you're diabetic or not. I think we can all agree that it is important. To respect your blood sugar levels and remember to continue feeding the  The Beast. Let at brunch just, you know, use small plates and try to keep the trips to the buffet line under under five or. So today. You learned how your body uses energy from food, including through cellular respiration, which converts glucose into ATP glycogenolysis, which converts it to glycogen and lipogenesis, which converts it to triglycerides. And you also learned how insulin regulates your sugar levels. Thank you to our Headmaster of learning Linnea boyev.

My first visit to Children's was actually the day. I was born, which was Christmas Day and I spent my very first 30 days and nights your children's in the NICU. How come you were here so long.

       " 'KiouveG278Y': \"sometimes in medicine you'll see that words get used a lot and sometimes their meaning is pretty simple or straightforward and you know can be understood but the words themselves and it being kind of tricky and confusing and I think some of that has to do with the fact that these words and Medicine often come from Latin and so we haven't really changed the word and so because Latin is not a language that any of us are really familiar with ends up being that the Become confusing. So what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to lay out four words for you going to put out for words start with Chrono Tropi and we're going to go through them one by one basically kind of describing what they mean. So Crona Tropi refers to the heart rate now actually put in kind of in parentheses a simpler way to maybe think about these terms. So Crona trophy has to do with heart rate a second term is drom otro p drom. Oh trope.  P and drum otro P has to do with conduction velocity conduction velocity how fast a signal is going from one cell to the next conduction velocity and then we have inotropy inotropy.  And I know trophy has to do with contractility contractility how hard the muscle is Contracting the force of contraction you can think of it as the force of contraction and Lucid Trope be Lucid Tropi. There we go, and looser trophy has to do with the relaxation how fast it's relaxing.  So let's go through these one at a time and talked about the effects of the sympathetic and the parasympathetic Saint this so actually the other thing I'm going to do maybe even white I'm going to write out where  Where these things are primarily being affected right where and then we'll talk about sympathetics and parasympathetics. Okay. So where is the first one happening? So we talked about Chrono Tropi and of course, it's not just one cell that's going to be affected. But in general what cluster of cells are we thinking of your you're right if you think about the SA node, right the SA node?  And this is where the heart rate is usually set and submit the sympathetics. We're going to basically make the SA node go and fire faster because they're going to allow more sodium into those cells. So it's going to get up to the threshold for an action potential more quickly and parasympathetics basically do the opposite right? They're going to allow less sodium to kind of flow in and it's going to take longer to get to the threshold potential. So what about drama Trophy? This is a word that's maybe less.  Commonly used and that's all I wanted to throw it up. Just so you're at least familiar with the fact that it exists. But drama Tropi has to do with conduction velocity. So how fast is the signal being conducted through the heart and remember for this the major delay ends up being the AV node, right the huge delay. Sometimes we say it's a tenth of a second is in the AV node. So what happens in the AV node if with sympathetic stimulation well,  You remember when you have sympathetic surround they allow the calcium to come into the cell more quickly. So you actually have a faster conduction velocity.  So actually there's less of a delay with sympathetics and with parasympathetics. There's a longer delay right? Again, it's slower the AV node because you have less calcium coming in during the action potential of the AV node. So the slope of the action potential is is slower is lower in parasympathetics.  Now what about these last two inotropy and Lusa Tropi? Well both have to do with the ventricles right contractility in the force of contraction and then relaxation is how quickly are the ventricles relaxing. So I'm going to write for both of them ventricles and I'm putting both ventricles left and right because it's not just one or the other same rules apply in both sides so ventricles  And already I can tell you that parasympathetics are going to have very little effect here. Right? Because we said that really sympathetics affect your ventricles in in the parasympathetic simply don't have a similar effect to counterbalance it. So I'm just going to put a little white wine there to imply. There's no major parasympathetic effect on either inotropy or looser Tropi from a ventricle standpoint.  All right, so sympathetics, what do they do for inotropy or in terms of inotropy? Well, you remember contractility is related to the amount of calcium that's going to come in during the action potential. So what's going to happen if you have sympathetic stimulation, we're going to get more calcium in there. So you're going to have a harder contraction or a stronger Force. I'll just put harder contraction meaning the muscles are going to squeeze down more forcefully than they would otherwise and what about relaxation?  Well, this is the interesting thing we talked about with the sarcoplasmic reticulum, right? That's what's going to mop up all the calcium and allow our heart to get back into a state of relaxing and it's going to happen much quicker with sympathetics because they stimulate those ATP channels or ATP pumps to get calcium pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and away or sequestered from the cell itself. So they basically create a fast  Relaxation. So these are kind of the quick and dirty. This is kind of a quick and dirty overview of these four words and again you may or may not hear these words, but at least you're familiar with them Chrono drum. Oh, I know and Lucy these four words describe the major functions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves on the heart.\",\n",

The glucose level will often be less than 70. Although, some will feel similar symptoms at numbers that are slightly higher after confirming. A low sugar level. The individual should immediately eat or drink something that has approximately 15 grams of simple sugar or carbohydrates. Our slow snail could have taken a plunge into 1/2 of a cup of juice or one cup of low-fat milk. Lastly.  Finger stick check should always be repeated 15 minutes later to ensure that the value has increased to above 70. If not another 15 grams of sugar should be consumed until the level improves.  Now back to the race, the other Runner, the hyped up snail represents high blood sugar levels or hyperglycemia, while this snail won the race easily.

Yes, so that my  And that's gastroparesis. I have been told that the pain is worse than giving birth. I myself can't confirm or deny that as I haven't given birth. But if that is worse than giving birth. I am so prepared to give birth. I will be sitting there with my legs up. Cilic. I'm on holiday. Basically, I'm ready for childbirth. Well, I'm planning on having a child anytime soon.  There are few different ways in order to diagnose gastro pieces and you could have one of the tests, you could have all of the tests. But the first thing that you'll probably have is an endoscopy, which is a little camera, going up, your nose, down the back of your throat and into your stomach. And I just kind of examined your stomach lining and ruled out other causes or conditions that could be going on. Another thing that they can do is 8  barium X-ray basically where you swallow a liquid, which is containing a chemical and it kind of has a chalky kind of texture. From what I can feel not that I swallow choke on a regular basis, but I should what you would imagine chalk to be like and you swallow it and you basically watch it on an X-ray and you can watch it, right? It going through your digestive tract. Another one, which they can do. And one is I had is a soup.  Test. So it is basically an ultrasound and you have to stop eating at a certain time. Then they do an ultrasound on your stomach. See if there's any food left in there. How much is in there that kind of thing then they make you have some soup or some form of liquid that they have. And then after so long, they will check your stomach again through the ultrasound and see what food is in there. How much is left in there? If anything's digested, that kind of  Of thing. And it's not that bad of a test and I had it and they actually ended up putting me on a liquid diet because it showed that I had a whole meal in there, even though I hadn't eaten for like,  Today's another test and I think is probably the main test. They used to diagnose gastroparesis. And it's called the gastric emptying test. This is basically a large machine that you lie under and they give you some food. I think I had mashed potato, which has a small amount of radioactive dye in it and they basically what your digestive system for like, four hours or so, and they see.  How long it takes for your body to digest it and how much is in your stomach after, you know, each hour as normal person food would be digested by a four hours or most of it would be digested. So, I think the number that they use is 10%. So if you have ten percent or more of the food left in your stomach, after 4 hours, then your diagnosis is there of gastroparesis and they can tell you how bad is basically a newer version. That I know that.  They're doing is the wireless capsule test. So it's a little capsule which I think has like a camera and tracks the speed that it goes through our digestive system and it's similar to the gastric emptying test, but it's just done with a capsule. I have swallowing difficulties. So I would never be able to have that but I believe this is at the newest thing that they're trying. Like I mentioned before, there is no cure to gastroparesis. There's just ways of managing the symptoms.  So that you can live as normal a life as possible. One of the biggest things. I'm probably the first things that they will do is a dietary change. They will probably get you to do, is have six smaller meals in a day rather than three big meals. And I mean, we're all supposed to do this anyway, but I mean, who's got time for that in reality? It's hard to do when you're living life and you're at school or you're working, it is hard, but it is  Really important with gastroparesis because it gives your body that little helping hand to keep the motility of the stomach and the digestive system going. But also gives it more of a chance to digest food rather than just shoving it all in there, which is totally what I do. Still not a dietary change that they'll make you do is to try softer foods that are easy to digest, rather than the hide of foods that need more work and take longer.  Ray and chew like your food really, really well. I know sometimes we just were in a hurry and we just kind of suck and swallow it. But in reality, we really need to chew our food because that is a form of digesting it. So if it's already broken down, then it's going to be easier to digest something inside and another dietary change that. I personally have found massively helpful is taking out any fizzy drinks. I wasn't a  big fizzy drink person anyway, but I would have the other one here and there but the gas and the bubbles in that will just play havoc on your insides and doesn't help with bloating at all in the slightest and make sure looks like nine nine months pregnant, which a lot of food does that's cash appreciated and fatty foods and sugary foods and basically, all the foods that you love. Yeah, you're going to limit them because your body doesn't love it.  It basically is the the gist of it. Another form of treatment for gastroparesis is the medication route. Obviously, we don't want to be on medication for life. But if it helps then it's giving you a life is my point of view on it. So the first medication that I was ever put on and I think it's the most popular one anyone's ever put on if you're in the UK for in the u.s. I know that it's band there and that is domperidone. Not Tom Perry on the wine.  Or champagne is it? You can tell I'm a drinker and\",\n",

       " 'ktQzM2IA-qU': \"Body on an examination table and the pathologist would come into the room and one day, a person died in the hospital of a massive heart attack. Probably from eating hospital food, but that's another story. So, to examine the heart, you have to remove a section of ribs. And this is not done with great delicacy. You take what looks like a garden Clipper and you go crunch crunch crunch through the ribs on this side and crunch, crunch crunch through the ribs on this side and the pathologist.  Pulled this big high wedge of ribs off the chest, set it on the table. And he knew that I was going to be going to medical school. So he wanted to make sure that I saw everything. It's a Neil. Look at this. These are the coronary arteries. We call them coronary coronary, because they crown the heart. And he sliced One open. He said look inside. And so with my gloved finger, I poked around and it wasn't a wide open artery. It had what was sort of like chewing gum inside except that it was hard.  A rock and he said, that's your bacon and eggs nail. That's atherosclerosis. And we looked at the carotid arteries, going to the brain, the arteries, going to the legs, the arteries, going to the kidneys. They all had this hardening of the arteries. This atherosclerosis. He said, we see the beginnings of this into thirds of people by age 23, which happened to be the exact age that I was at the time. So anyway, he writes up his findings, massive atherosclerosis acute. Myocardial infarction, and he leaves the room.  So I picked up the ribs and put them back in the chest. Tried to make them fit right with the other ribs, and I sewed up the skin and cleaned up and then I went out and went up to the cafeteria where it turned out they were serving ribs for lunch.  Now, let me tell you something. I knew about ribs. I grew up in Fargo, North Dakota. I come from a long line of cattle ranchers. And I remember the smell of the cows in the field. I remember the smell of the cows in my grandpa's barn. And I remember driving a load of cattle with my uncle to East st. Louis to the National Stock Yards, and I remember the National Stock Yards Hotel, two dollars a night and the smell of that room. And I have to say every day of my life. It was roast beef, baked potatoes, and corn.  Except for special occasions. When it was roast beef, baked potatoes, and peas. And that's sort of the way we ate. But my father did not like the cattle business. So he left left the family farm and he went to medical school and he spent his life at the Fargo Clinic treating diabetes. He became the diabetes expert for the whole region and I have to say,  My father really was frustrated because patients were given diets that they did not like what we would say is or what they would say, is diabetes is a condition where there's too much sugar in your blood. So don't eat anything that turns to Sugar. So don't eat bread. Don't eat fruit. Don't eat pasta, don't eat rice. Don't eat sweet potatoes. Don't eat regular potatoes. Don't eat beans, don't eat carrots. All these things had to be limited and while you're at it cut calories and that's what people were supposed to adhere to that get sold by Wednesday patients were also given medicine.  And they were given the needles and instruction on how to stick their fingers and how to inject insulin and despite all of this.  Diabetes never got better. It always progressed and it then became something that we were exporting overseas and when I got out of medical school, we had more medicines and I think we had sharper needles but to tell you the truth, it was the same sort of result. We had unhappy patients and we never ever cured this disease. It never turned around. It was always considered a progressive disease.  But there were two scientific discoveries.  That really turned all of this around. And the first one was taking the widest possible lens. If you look around the world at those countries, that have the least diabetes like Japan, for example, they weren't following anything like the diet that we were giving to diabetic patients. We they weren't saying gee, I'm not going to eat rice. I want to eat noodles. They eat this kind of food all the time. It's front and center on their plate.  And the second Discovery came from looking inside the cell, especially the muscle cell. And the reason we look at muscle cells in particular, is that's where glucose is going. That's where blood sugar is going. That's the fuel that powers your movement, you know about a person who is running a marathon. What are they doing in the weeks leading up for it? They're carbo-loading. So, they're eating pasta and they're eating bread to try to get that glucose into the cell for energy.  And that is the problem in diabetes because glucose glucose. Is there outside the cell, trying to get inside, in order to get in, it needs a key. And that key is insulin. Now what if I get home? And I'm getting up to my front door and I take my keys out of my pocket. I put it in the front door.  Wait a minute. It's not working.  And there's nothing wrong with Mikey, but I look in the lock. And while I was gone, somebody put chewing gum in my luck. So what am I going to do crawl in and out the window? No, I'm going to clean out the lock. Well, when a person has diabetes, their insulin key is not working. Why would that be? Why could insulin not signal this? What's supposed to happen is the glucose is supposed to enter into the cell. And glucose is the key that makes that happen. But the reason it doesn't happen. It's not that there's chewing gum inside the cell.  What there is is fat, fat little globules of fat. Now? I have to say doctors hate words like fat. It's got one syllable. So we want to call it intra myo cellular lipid.  Intra means inside, myo means muscle, cellular means cellular limit, lipid means fat into a microcellular. The pit is fat inside your muscle cells and that is what interferes with insulins ability to work like a key to Signal glucose coming in. Now in 2003, the National Institutes of Health gave my research team a grant and said, let's test something completely different instead of  Cutting Breads, and all of these kinds of things. What if, if that is the issue? What if we have a diet that has a effectively no fat in it. Well, where does that come from? It comes from two sources animal products, animal fat, and vegetable oils. So we brought in 99 people, and we asked them to do, two things to really eat a bounty of food. Not worrying about quantity. We're not counting calories. Here. We are not counting carbs, grams or anything like that. What we're doing instead is we're setting the Animal product aside.  Keeping the vegetable oils low, very simple. Now. One of our participants was a man named Vance and Vance's, father was dead by age. 30 Vance, was 31 when he was diagnosed with diabetes. He was in his late 30s. When he came to see us and he said, this is not hard. Unlike every other diet. He'd been on, we didn't care how many carbs he ate, or how many calories or how many portions if he was having chili. Not a meat, chili would be a bean chili chunky, vegetable chili. If he  Having spaghetti, instead of a meat topping, it would be topped with artichoke hearts and wild mushrooms and Chunky Tomato Sauce. And that kind of thing. Very, very easy. Over a course of about a year. He lost 60 pounds, his blood sugar came down and down, and down. In one day. His doctor said him down and said vans.  I know you've had family members die of this disease, but as I look at your blood tests.  You don't have it anymore. And can you imagine what that feels like to have family members? Who felt there was absolutely a one-way Street and have this disease. Just turn around and when I asked Vance's permission to tell you about his story. He said, make sure you tell everybody that my erectile dysfunction went away, too.  Write that down. Okay, so we published our findings in peer-reviewed journals, the American Diabetes Association now sites it and accepts that accepts this as an effective approach and people around the world started using this. And I heard from a man in England who wanted to let me know about his experience. He had diabetes tried all kinds of diets without a lot of success and then he heard about our approach, tried it for several weeks, went to the doctor, the doctor drew a number of blood test and he got home, the phone.  Right. It's the doctor's office. Could you come back right now?  So he good Heavens what's in my blood test and he races into his car and he's driving to the doctor's office thinking. What disease did they discover on my blood test to what did they find? And he runs into the doctor's office. They say we need to sit down, explain exactly what you've been doing.  All traces of his diabetes were gone. The doctor said, your blood tests are better than mine. And I don't have diabetes. How is this possible? The doctor explained to him, that we can never say that a person has been cured of diabetes. Could because we all know that's not possible, but technically  It's not there, and the doctor was skeptical. He said, come back in two months. I want to test you again. Never came back now. Wait a minute.  Diabetes is genetic, right? It runs in families, and they're, in fact, our genes for diabetes. But this is an important thing to remember, genes are in two categories, certain genes are dictators. I'm talking about the jeans. That's a blue eyes or brown hair. They are dictators. They give orders, you can't argue, but the genes for diabetes are  Committees, they're making suggestions and you can say, well, wait a minute. I don't really think I want to have diabetes. And, in fact, most diseased genes, whether it's for heart disease or diabetes or hypertension, certain forms of cancer. Even Alzheimer's disease, they're not dictators their committees and they are their activity. Depends on what we put into our bodies. So what I'm saying,  Is that we're putting into our bodies foods that we're really not.  designed for,  Which raises the question. What foods are we really designed for? Well, there are different ways of looking at this and one is called the dental test, you know. The dental test.  What you do is you wait for your cat to yawn and you look in your cat's mouth. And what you notice is in his mouth. Are these very, very long protruding canine teeth and on each side of his mouth. It's just like a pitchfork. It's really good for capturing. Prey, killing small animals, and ripping the hide off the Flesh and eating me. So now, look at your own mouth.  What you discover is that your canine teeth are no longer than your incisors and that change occurred, at least three and a half million years ago. So our molars are really good for crunching on an Apple. They're not so hot for hand.\",\n",

Checking your blood sugar, knowing what the numbers mean is very important in regards to taking blood glucose readings, if you know everything about getting the numbers, but don't know why, or what they mean. You're wasting your time and effort knowing if your blood sugar is too high.  Or too low or just, right? Is vital in treating diabetes. Now you were diagnosed with pre-diabetes because of these numbers you are diagnosed with pre-diabetes because of these numbers. Your fasting blood glucose level was between 100 and 125 on two separate readings. This is the amount of glucose that was present in your blood after a time of not eating normal, blood glucose levels are less than  It now, you are shooting for a fasting blood glucose level between 80 and 120 before each meal, which is called pre prandial, a postprandial reading, should be less than 180. Now, reading of less than 80 is considered hypoglycemic. This means your blood glucose level is getting too low. In this case. You will need to get some carbs in your system. The recommended amount if carbs is  In grams and then check your blood sugar again. Now if your fasting blood glucose level is too high, especially before eating saying that 180 range. You may need to take a fast acting insulin to help bring it down. This all depends on whether your doctor has actually prescribed insulin for you or not. Probably not with prediabetes, but this should be discussed with your doctor and is one of the reasons taking blood sugar.  Things are so important. Now a test that will occur at the doctor's office and not at home is called the A1C. Test A1C is used to diagnose, diabetes and used as an indicator to help manage the disease. The A1C test is a blood test that provides information about a person's average levels of blood glucose called blood sugar over the past three months. Now, you may hear your doctor called the A1c.  It's also sometimes called a hemoglobin A1c, or an hba1c or a glycohemoglobin test. Most people use A1C. Now specifically, the A1C test measures the percentage of your hemoglobin that is coated with sugar. Hemoglobin is a protein in red, blood cells that carries oxygen. If you have a high A1C then you aren't controlling your blood sugar very well.

When in reality, you may not be see the A1C number is a percentage of the average blood glucose level. It is measured in milligrams per deciliter and for someone without diabetes, the A1C should be 5.7 or below. When the A1C test is used to diagnose diabetes and A1C level of 6.5 or highwomen.  Fire on two different tests yields, a diagnosis of diabetes, a result between 5.7 and 6.4. Well, that would give the diagnosis of prediabetes.

It's a very complex thing to measure like, you can't just measure it, traditionally you need equipment to do, you need a cuff that inflates and then you need a stethoscope to hear what's going on inside there. They have equipment to like speed it up, but it's not a OneTouch process. The other reason why I find it interesting is that  Okay, it's actually the more important reason is that blood pressure is one of the leading risk factors when it comes to cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular disease, is the number one leading cause of death globally. It's literally like the, the number one thing that kills people in the world cardiovascular disease. And if you have a device like a phone that you can hold in your hand that can measure blood pressure, like that, that could change the world that could literally save lives. So I wanted to see what this thing could do. I wanted to see if this  Accurate. I wanted to see if the sensor worked like I thought it would work and yeah, there's some good things and some bad things but we're just going to go through real quickly. So to make this whole thing work, you need to get an app. It's specific to the S9, the S9 plastic. It doesn't work on other phones. It's called my BP lab and it's made in conjunction with Samsung. It's through some University and it's the only app that currently uses the blood pressure sensor. Now, this may change in the future. But as of today, the middle of March, that's the only way they can use this blood pressure sensor on the S9 and the S9 +.  Okay. So when you set this thing up, the first thing you'll notice is that this is a research study and the data that this app measures and collects is used to kind of see the relationship between stress and health. It's an interesting study. But I mean, I'm here just for the blood pressure measurement. That's all I really care about. Okay, so you have to sign a whole bunch of consent things, but it's pretty easy to get it up and running. Now, the first time you use this, it asks you to do a base measurement for your blood pressure and that's where things get a little bit weird. The app doesn't tell you an actual number like, you don't know.  Blood pressure value. You just know that that's your base measurement and any subsequent measurement that you do with the app. It just tells you if it's gone up or down as a percentage never actually gives you a number. Now there is a way to get a number into the system. You have to calibrate it using external hardware. So you need a blood pressure cuff or blood pressure machine of some sort or you can go to your physician and get it done. But you can input an actual known measurement for your base blood pressure. So that the app knows what that base value is. So every time you re measure it, if it goes up or down, it'll kind of just calculate what the difference is. And  Give you the new updated value. So, the app doesn't actually measure blood pressure. It just kind of measures the change in blood pressure. So if you have like a base value that the app knows, it can give you a number but if you don't, you don't have an actual measurement, so the sensor uses PPG, to try to measure the blood pressure. It's basically an optical measurement. The sensor has a couple of LEDs and it measures the way that the light reflects off of your finger tip when it's covering the sensor to obtain a value. So I calibrated this thing to my blood pressure, but when I use the app on my family members and Friends,  And some of them who I know have drastically different blood pressures from me the app and the sensor just weren't picking up proper differences. Now, it is possible or even very likely that the app kind of caters to the user like because it's calibrated to me. It wouldn't work on other people. I think that's very likely but I did test this thing out in a different way. So what I did was I just exercise and exercise does elevate blood pressure, a bit and the app does pick up that increase in blood pressure, but it doesn't seem to be as accurate as a blood pressure cuff. Now, it could be a limitation with the  well sensor, like maybe it's not designed to measure elevated blood pressure from exercise because that's like not how you want to measure blood pressure normally, but I mean, that's just that's the only way that I can really test or pretend to test its accuracy. Now, there are other limitations one. I noticed that cold fingers don't work very well, dry fingers as well. Like I have can some dry hands from the winter and just like, it doesn't always work reliably. And the app itself, mentions that certain skin, pigmentations may not work, but I think the big limitation comes from the sensor itself.  Or at least the algorithm that the sensor is using to calculate blood pressure. So I think it's weird that it doesn't measure blood pressure. But I did a little research on just whole technology and that seems to be an issue with the tech. Like there's a feasibility study on this stuff and they're saying that you could measure the relative variation of blood pressure, but they couldn't find the absolute pressure value. Like I'm not even comfortable saying that this thing can measure blood pressure. It can measure the change in blood pressure, but it can't actually measure your blood pressure. At least not with the current iteration of this app. Now, I think this  This app and this Hardware in this whole thing, can get way better. And I think that may be why Samsung is doing this partnership with University, like maybe they're going to be taking the data from, like all the people that I'm using this app and using it to improve the sensor or the algorithm that is used in this sensor and like that could just make it better over time. But right now, the app and the sensor feel kind of mediocre to me. So the idea of a phone that you could use to check your blood pressure intermittently is awesome. And I think for some very, very rare cases, it could  Technically save a life even in its current iteration. Like if you were someone that didn't know anything about your blood pressure and he started using this thing and you notice that it was elevated. You could kind of do something to monitor or manage that that's cool. But for the vast majority of people that are interested in this phone, like I would not consider the blood pressure monitor a substantial feature, at least not enough to Warrant the purchase of this phone because of that feature. Okay. Hope you guys enjoyed this video, thumbs. If you liked it subs, you loved it. See you guys next time.\",\n",
       " 'KxQTLP2KeaE': \"Insulin is the hormone normally made in the pancreas that stimulates the flow of sugar glucose from the blood into the cells of the body glucose provides the cells with the energy they need to function.  There are two main groups of insulins used in the treatment of diabetes human insulins and analog insulins made by recombinant DNA technology.  The concentration of most insulins available in the United States is 100 units per milliliter a milliliter is equal to a cubic centimeter. All insulin syringes are graduated to match this insulin concentration.  There are four categories of insulins depending on how quickly they start to work in the body after injection. Very rapid acting insulin or rapid-acting insulins intermediate acting insulins long-acting insulin.  In addition some insulins are marketed mixed together in different proportions to provide both rapid and long-acting affects certain insulins can also be mixed together in the same syringe immediately prior to injection.  A very rapid acting form of insulin called Liz bro. Insulin is marketed under the trade name of Humalog a second form of very rapid acting insulin is called as part and is marketed under the trade name novolog.  Humalog and novolog are clear liquids. They begin to work ten minutes after injection Peak at 1 hour after injection and last 3 to 4 hours in the body Humalog and novolog are used as bolus insulins to be given 15 minutes before a meal most patients also need a longer-acting insulin to maintain good control of their blood sugar Humalog and novolog.  Can be mixed with mph.  Check your blood sugar level before giving Humalog or novalog your doctor or diabetes educator will instruct you in determining your insulin dose based on your blood sugar reading and anticipated meals and exercise always check the bottle before drawing up the insulin. If the solution is cloudy discard the bottle if you are mixing Humalog or novalog with a longer-acting insulin always drop the Humalog.  NovoLog first to maintain the Purity and Clarity of the Humalog and novolog Solutions  Another solution of insulin that acts rapidly is called regular or our insulin. This insulin does not act as quickly as Humalog or novalog.  Regular insulin is a clear colorless liquid. It begins to work 30 minutes after injection Peaks at three to five hours and last 6 to 10 hours in the body regular insulin is usually given 30 minutes before a meal it can also be mixed in the same syringe with longer acting mph or given separately immediately after each other.  Large and cannot be mixed with it.  Regular insulin is the most stable of all the different types of insulin but unopened regular insulin is best refrigerated always check the bottle before drawing up the insulin. If the solution is cloudy discard the bottle if you are mixing regular with a longer-acting insulin always drop the regular insulin first to maintain the Purity and Clarity of the regular solution.  examples of intermediate acting insulins are NPH  intermediate acting insulins are cloudy suspensions of crystalline insulin. They need to be gently rotated between the hands before being used. They begin to work 1 hour after injection Peak at 6 to 12 hours after injection and last 20 to 24 hours in the body. The intermediate insulins are often given before breakfast. They may also be given at bedtime depending on your  Glucose reading they can be mixed in the same syringe with regular list bro and asked part insulins. Another long-acting insulin is called glargine insulin. It is an insulin analog manufactured by recombinant DNA technology.  Unlike other long-acting insulins glargine insulin is a clear solution of insulin it begins to work about one hour after injection.  There is no pronounced Peak small amounts of glargine insulin are released slowly to provide a relatively constant amount of insulin in the body over 24 hours glargine insulin cannot be mixed with any other insulin a change to glargine from NP age should be done under the close supervision of your medical team.  There are three stable pre mixed formulations of insulin one contains 70% of NPH insulin and 30% of regular insulin another formulation contains 50% of NPH and 30% of regular insulin the third contains 75% of the mph and 25% of Humalog.  These mixtures begin to work around 1/2 hour after injection peek into to eight hours and last up to 24 hours in the body as these pre-mixed insulins contain Rapid or very rapid acting insulin. They should be taken before meals as directed by your medical team.  With your doctor's instructions several combinations of two different types of insulin can be mixed together in the same syringe and given as one injection once mixed the combined injection must be given immediately or the effect of the regular component of the injection will be diminished.  The rapid acting insulin list bro, ask part and regular can be mixed with a longer acting NPH insulin glargine cannot be mixed with any other insulin.\",\n",
       " 'KYQ2dPW5nEU': \"Biology is one way to approach questions in the biological sciences by seeing what we can make, you know, whole organisms, new genomes rewiring circuitry. So I think you'll find it to be a very interesting discussion on Thursday. But first before we talk about synthetic biology, we have the very exciting discussion today on human genetics, which of course, concerns, all of us. And so we're going to have an exploration today and do as I prepared today's lecture. I want to give you the latest and greatest  Research findings or to talk today from fundamental techniques to things that are very controversial that have cost physics cause fist fights in bars. So I'm hopeful that you'll be as engaged that people drinking. Beer are so we'll be turning to that at the end of the lecture. But first I wanted to tell you about the broad narrative Arc. Once again that we're going to be talking about today and we're going to be looking at how to discover human variation, right? We're all different.  One based in every thousand and there are two different broad approaches historically people have used micro arrays for discovering variance and we'll talk about how those were designed and we'll talk about how to actually test for the significance of human variation with respect to a particular disease and a case in control study. And then we'll talk about how to use a whole genome, read data to detect variation between humans and some of the challenges in that.  Because it does not make as many assumptions as the microarray studies and therefore is much much more complicated to process. And so we're going to take a view into the best practices processing human read data. So you can understand what the state of the art is and then we're going to turn to a study showing how we can bring together different threads. We've talked about in this subject.  In particular, we've talked about the idea that we can use other genomic signals such as histone marked, identify things like regulatory elements. So we're going to talk about how we can take that lens and focus it on the genome. Discover particular genomic variants that have been revealed to be very important in a particular disease.  And finally, we'll talk about the idea that what beginning we're going to talk about today is all about correlation.  And as all you go forward in your scientific career, I'm hopeful deal. Always be careful to not confuse Association or correlation with causation.  You're always respected. When you clearly articulate, the difference, when you're giving a talk saying, this is correlated. We don't necessarily know it's causative until we do the right set of experiments. Okay. On that note, we'll turn to the computational approaches. We're going to talk about, we'll talk about contingency tables and various ways of thinking about them when we discuss, how to identify whether or not a particular snip is associated with a disease.  He's using various kinds of tests. And then we talk about read data. We'll talk about likelihood based tests how to do things. Like, take a population of individuals and their read data and estimate. The genotypic frequencies at a particular Locus. Using that data in Toto, using e.m. Based techniques.  Okay, so let us begin then.  Some of the things we're not going to talk about include non-random. Genotyping failure methods to correct for population. Stratification and structural variants and copy number variations .3 will just briefly touch on but fundamentally there just embellishments on the fundamental techniques were talking about and so I I didn't really want to confuse two days. A discussion.  Now.  I'm in Dillion disorder is a disorder defined by a single Gene.  And therefore, they're relatively easy to map.  And they also tend to be in low frequency in the population because they're selected against, especially the more severe mendelian disorders. And therefore, they correspond to very rare mutations in the population.  By point of contrast, if you thought about the genetics, we discussed last time. If you think about a trait that actually perhaps influenced by 200 genes, and maybe that one of those genes is not necessary or sufficient, for a particular disease, as a consequence. It could be a fairly common variant. It's only if you're unlucky enough to get all the other 199 variance. We actually come down with that syndrome.  And therefore, you can see that the effect of variation in the human genome is inversely related to its frequency that fairly rare variants could have very serious effects.  Whereas fairly common variants tend to have.  A fewer effects. And in the first phase of mapping human variation, people thought that common variants were things that had a allelic frequency in the population of five percent or greater.  And then to burrow Down, Deeper the Thousand genomes project surveyed a collection of different populations. And therefore, if you thought that a variant was prevalent in the population at a frequency of 0.5 percent, how many people would have it in 1000 genomes project correctly?  Just think your mom used were phase lock here. Half a percent thousand people. Five. Great. Okay, good. Now, of course, these are three different populations or more and so it might be that in fact that variants only present one of the populations. So just might be one or two people to actually have that particular variant. So the idea, is that the way that you design  Snip chips to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms. Otherwise known as Snips is that you do these population based sequencing studies and you design the array based upon all the common variants that you find, okay?  And therefore their array gives you a direct read out in terms of the variation in terms of all these common variants. That's where we'll start today. And where we'll end today is sequencing based approaches which make no assumptions whatsoever and just you know all hell breaks loose. I mean, it's so you'll see what happens. Okay, but I want to just to reinforce the idea that there are different allelic, frequencies of variance.  And that as we get down to rare and rare, alleles, right? We have larger effects, but these higher frequency alleles could also have effects, even though they're much smaller.  Okay, so let's talk about how these variants arise and what they mean in terms of a small little cartoon. So long, long ago, in a world far, far away a mutation occurred where a base G. Got mutated to a base, a, okay. And  this was in the context of a population of individuals all happy smiling individuals because they all actually do not have a disease.  And then in our story goes, what happens is that we had, yet, another generation of people who are all happy, smiley because they do not have the disease, right?  Yes, I do tell stories at night to and then.  Another mutation occurred.  And that mutation caused some subset of those people to get the mutation and for them to get the disease. So the original mutation was not sufficient for people to get this genetic disease. It required a second mutation for them to get the genetic disease. Okay, so it's at League at least you got two genes involved in it.  Okay, the other thing that we note is that in this particular case, so many people have the disease, the don't have this mutation.  And therefore this mutation is not necessary. It's neither necessary nor sufficient.  Still, it is a marker of a gene that increases risk and that's a fundamental idea, right? That you can increase risk without being necessary or sufficient to cause a particular genetic disorder.  Okay, and so you get this Association, then between genotype and phenotype. And that's what we're going to go looking for right now. Okay. We're on the hunt. We're going to go looking for this for this relationship.  So,  In certain older individuals. Hopefully not myself in the future. What happens is that your macula switch is the center of your eye degenerates as shown here and you get this unfortunate property where you can't actually see this in the center of your field of vision. It's called age-related macular degeneration. So to look for the causes of this, which is Jeanette known to be genetically related.  The authors of the study collected a collection of cohort is it's called of these European descent individuals, all who are at least 60 years old.  To study the genetic foundations for this disorder.  and,  So, they found 934 controls that were unaffected by age-related macular degeneration and 1238 cases, and they genotype them all using arrays.  Now the question is, are any of the identified Snips on the array related to?  This particular disorder.  So I'll give you the answer first and then we'll talk about a couple different ways of thinking about this data. Okay?  So here's the answer. Here's a particular. Snip RS10, 61 170.  There are the individuals with AMD and\",\n",
       " 'L-a-dKhuYj8': \"New ruling allows women who have high levels of testosterone to continue to compete against other women in athletic events to give you some more information about this. It involves a runner by the name of Duty Chand and the court of arbitration for sport ruled today that she a 19-year old Indian Sprinter could continue to race despite her higher than normal levels of testosterone. So this is an India and there are a significant amount of women actually that suffer from a condition.  Russian that makes their testosterone levels higher than the average woman, okay, and according to reports it could have some impact on how you perform. It could give you a little bit of a Competitive Edge. So for a very long time female athletes had to go undergo so called gender testing to make sure that they weren't too masculine to compete in athletics. It still happens. So in this case, they're finally saying hey if  Got naturally occurring testosterone. That's at higher levels. Are we not merciful? We're going to let you going to Pardon you okay? Because you did not cheating its naturally occurring and they're not males. Right but as recently as the 2012 London Olympics for women were forced to have their internal testes removed in order to compete now, they were genetically female but they had male sex organs. Okay, and they were all competing is that also amazing is four of them in one.  X and they had to have the internal testes removed. So look if they genuinely wanted to undergo that procedure great, but it's mind-boggling to me that anyone would go through something so invasive just to compete. I mean, I'm not an athletic person. So of course, I'm not in that world and that's part of the reason why I don't understand but if someone told me while I was playing softball in high school. Hey Anna like your boobs are getting in the way like maybe reduce them a little bit. I wouldn't do it. Yeah, I  And look it has a super interesting question. We give credit to Ronnie a lot of times. It's not go ahead guys because he had a part of his finger removed so he can play in the next game in the playoffs and we're like, that's a man right now. I would argue that having your internal testes removed as a whole different level. Okay, and now most of us don't have internal testing. So it's not much of an issue, but it certainly was for those for women in other case Olympic runner Caster. Semenya was  both had both male and female sex organs and she had take hormones to supplement her Androgen levels. So look part of the problem here is that we know too much like we are so scientifically Advanced now like in the old days for the women that we're talking about in the beginning. She's that with a high level of testosterone. She might have that because of an imbalance in our bodies. We would have known any of that just would have been like, oh she's good at running.  How do we know like I think that's the amazing thing? How do we even know that their testosterone levels are because they're testing them non-stop because you're trying to see if they're taking testosterone. I see right that makes sense because they're be of the people cheating and that's also because of scientific advancement. Okay, so I don't begrudge them for wanting to do the testing but for anyone who's watching this who might think well that's not fair if they have higher levels of testosterone than they have that Competitive Edge. Well the same could be said about someone who's playing in the NBA and is 7 foot tall.  Right. It's first of all something that they can't help. It's just how they're naturally built. And yeah, they have a Competitive Edge, but that doesn't mean that you should ban them from the sport because they're too tall that's like going to a runner and saying but you're too fast. I knew that but that's exactly my point that used to be called sad day for you. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, she's faster than you. She's faster than you because she happens to have a higher level of testosterone. Somebody else could be faster than you for a different reason. Well, that's not fair. She are fast. Twitch muscles are better than mine. I know.  Well, that's what she won the race. So now look there's a part of me. That's a knucklehead here and I'm like, huh man or better posture. I got a lot of this stuff. It's smoked meat eraser doesn't matter how much testosterone I have. So like I know they the you secretly don't you don't want men to pretend they're women and go and win the women's events. Yes men do have an advantage over all in  speed strength Etc. Right, but you're going too far. These are not women trying to pretend to be men. They're not taking extra testosterone if they were cheating like that there were on your side here. Not only for the women in this case, but I wouldn't know how the other woman remove their internal testes and remove body parts. That's how they were born. But they're women let him compete I give those women so much respect and credit because they love to compete to undergo something.  Like that, that's that's the point that I was trying to make like to undergo something that invasive because you love the sport that much is incredible to me. Yeah. I'm a super competitive dude, but I wouldn't let you touch my testes. Don't worry. No one wants to touch your testy.\",\n",
       " '0V-Xmps1mE': \"In states of our body. Now, fed refers to our bodies state right after immediately, after eating a meal. And remember that, in terms of hormones, the hormone that's going to be elevated is going to be insulin, which is elevated in response to higher blood glucose levels. Immediately following a meal and levels of the hormone glucagon are going to be decreased. Now, of course, is going to be opposite.  Several hours after a meal, which we call the fasted state in which the levels of insulin will be decreased. And of course in response to low blood glucose levels, the levels of glucagon in our body will start to rise along with a couple of other hormones as well. But these are the two or two, at least, big hormones, that regulate the bulk of metabolism in our body. Now starting with the FED State. Let's start at the beginning of the story recall that we  Proteins from our food and those proteins are broken down into amino acids inside of our small intestine. And just as a side note, you might hear the terms essential and non-essential amino acids used, especially in medical literature. And what this simply refers to is that essential amino acids, are those amino acids of the 20, that we know of that our body cannot synthesize. And so we must,  Somehow get these in our diet, whereas non-essential amino acids, can be actually synthesized in our body and we don't need them as part of our diet. But getting back to these amino acids, once they're broken down in the small intestine. They travel via the bloodstream directly to the liver, just like glucose. Now, once the amino acids have made it to the liver, several things can happen. The liver can use these amino acids directly for protein synthesis.  I can also use any excess amino acids and convert these into glucose and or fatty acids. And of course, we're call that the storage. The ultimate storage forms of these two molecules are going to be glycogen. And the case of glucose which is stored in the liver mainly and for fatty acids, we store these as try acyl glycerides.  In our adipose tissue. So, how does this conversion from amino acids to glucose and fatty acids happen. You might ask. Well, remember that the precursor for glucose or I should say precursors can be proved eight, as well as oxaloacetate. And for fatty acids, the main precursor for fatty acid synthesis is the molecule acetyl Co a and as the relevant side note. I want to point out that a Sudoku.  Happens to be in equilibrium with another molecule in the cell called a Sido acetyl Co a and oxaloacetate. If you remember, is an equilibrium with a lot of the, intermediates of the Krebs cycle. So I'm going to brew V8 pierrez, intermediates of Krebs cycle. And there are numerous molecules with numerous names that I won't mention here. But just so that you get the big picture. Now, the key Point here. Is that a  Amino acids, specifically, the carbon backbone of these amino acid molecules can be interconverted, and metabolize directly into the molecules in the precursor molecules that I've listed here for fatty acids and glucose so they can be converted to rectly into pyruvate into oxaloacetate as well as intermediates of the Krebs cycle acetyl Co a as well as Sido acetyl Co a. Now, another classification that you might here with regard to amino acids is  An amino acid is so called a ketogenic amino acid or whether it is a gluco genic amino acid and that simply refers to whether the carbon backbone of these amino acid, molecules feeds into the precursor molecules for glucose synthesis or whether it feeds into the precursor molecules for fatty acid synthesis. So in this case, ketogenic amino acids are converted to acetyl co a or  Osito acetyl Co a, and ultimately fatty acids, whereas gluco genic amino acids feed into pyruvate oxaloacetate or intermediates of the Krebs cycle. Now, just as a fun fact, it turns out that there are two amino acids, that are exclusively ketogenic and those are lysine and leucine. So, anytime you ingest lysine or loosing. You will definitely be making fatty acids from those amino acids, if they're ingested in excess, of course, other amino acids can actually contribute.  To glucose genetic Pathways and some might even contribute to both but that's just kind of a fun fact. Now going back to the journey of our amino acids here. Remember that? It enters the liver and the liver can either use it for protein synthesis or convert it into other energy storage forms, but it can also send it off and it can send it off to other tissues such as the muscle, for example, where the muscle can use it for its own protein synthesis. So other cells will also receive  amino acids that are digested that they can use for protein synthesis as well. Now, moving on to the facets, Tatum also going to put the liver here at kind of the center of our diagram, because remember, the liver is quite a centerpiece when it comes to metabolism. A lot of things were going on in the liver and specifically in the fasted State. You might recall that fatty acids are being released from adipose tissue and being sent to the liver where they're being oxidized.  And all of that ATP is fueling the synthesis of glucose. And if the person is in a very severe state of starvation, let's say they haven't had a meal for two or three days. We might even be producing ketones as well. Now, even though we think of fatty acids as being the main fuel, that's being sent to the liver and Times of fasting, we can't forget about amino acids, which are released from our tissues. Mostly are our  It's really and they're sent via the bloodstream also to the liver. Now, once amino acids have arrived at the liver, the factory house. So to say, for energy production in times of fasting, remember that they can enter a diverse array of metabolic pathways. So I want to remind you in are fed discussion. We talked about gluco genic and ketogenic amino acids. So, in times of fasting, potentially these gluco genic amino acids, can contribute to these precursors.  Has of gluconeogenesis and help support the production of glucose in times of fasting. Now, those that become intermediates of the Krebs cycle. Might potentially also contribute to the production of some ATP in the cell, but I want to remind you of the big picture that only about 10 to 15 percent of our total energy production is supplied by amino acid. So we really still think about fatty acids comprising, the bulk of ATP production inside of our body, but  These amino acids are clearly important for providing those carbon backbones to support glucose synthesis. And of course, he's ketogenic amino acids, could also potentially contribute to the synthesis of acetyl Co a and subsequently ketones. But remember that the whole purpose of ketones synthesis was to try and preserve the degradation of protein in our muscles so that we could switch to a more kind of sustainable fuel based on the immense influx of fatty.  Acids that we were getting into the liver. So really this acetyl Co a that contributes to Ketone synthesis. We think about has largely coming from these fatty acids. So I'll go ahead and kind of write this double arrow in to remind us of that fact. Now, I want to go ahead and scroll down and actually mention one unique thing about the catabolism of amino acids recall the basic structure of an amino acid and I'll go ahead and draw the structure of an amino acid at physiological pH so at  Geological pH. We know that we have this carboxylate anion and we have this carbon here attached to an amino group. That's protonated. And we also have some type of functional group which we usually abbreviated are, which makes the identity of all these amino acids unique. And then we can't forget this extra hydrogen here. So that's the basic structure of an amino acid. And the point that I want to highlight here. Is that something that's unique to the breakdown of proteins that we haven't run into in the breakdown of fatty.  Acids or glucose is the presence of this nitrogen in this amine group, right here. Now notably. I did not mention that this amine group was contributing in any way to these precursor molecules that we talked above with regard to the breakdown of amino acids and specifically. If you remember, I use the term carbon backbone of amino acids to refer to this part right here, that was being converted to all of these precursor molecules and into  Generally, the first step involved in the catabolism of amino acids, or the breakdown of amino acids, is something called a trans emanation step in which the amine group on this amino acid is transferred to another molecule for eventual excretion by the body. And that, of course, frees up the carbon backbone to contribute to the rest of these metabolic pathways.  And so, ultimately this becomes something called an alpha keto acid and it's called an alpha keto acid because of what its structure looks like. So, it ends up looking something like this, it, obtains, a ketone group here. And of course, it's still attached to its our group. So, it's Alpha because it refers this Alpha, carbon relative to this carboxylate ion. And if the keto, because it's a ketone, and it's an acid because it's  Attached to this carboxylic acid, functional group here. So Alpha keto acid and this is the carbon backbone that can contribute to all of those metabolic pathways. And now even though I'm only going to touch the surface of this, as one last thing I do want to mention that the common acceptor for this amine group, The Common molecule that accepts this amine group from amino acids, is a molecule called Alpha, keto gluta rate and this might ring a bell because it is an international  erm.\",\n",

Mellitus is a, chronic metabolic disease, in which, the patient suffers from high level of glucose. In the blood. There are numerous natural remedies for diabetes, which when combined with a healthy lifestyle can help in controlling and maintain blood sugar at healthy levels.  The most important factor that affects both type 1 and type. 2, diabetes is diet.  And as well-planned diet can work effectively in maintaining blood glucose at healthy levels.  Here we have list of foods, diabetes should avoid white bread. One of the most dangerous foods for diabetes is refined starch. Refined starch is found in any food that is made by white floor, such as white bread, white flour, pasta Etc. These refined carbohydrates have high glycemic index that causes a rapid rise of blood sugar levels, which is extremely harmful to diabetic.  Since these complex carbohydrates take longer to be digested and lead to gradual study. Rise in blood sugar whole milk, whole milk and full-fat. Dairy products. Also come under the list of foods to be avoided, in diabetes. Full-fat. Dairy products are loaded with saturated fats, that increases insulin resistance and bosons the conditions for diabetic patients the saturated fats.  Rises, the level of harmful, LDL, bad, cholesterol in the blood and increases the risk of heart disease has white rice, white rice contain low, quality carbohydrates, and lack fibers. White rice is easily digested, which in turn shoots up the blood glucose level opt for whole grains such as barley oatmeal, high-fiber, cereals, and if you can't stay away from right,  Then replace white rice with brown rice that has numerous health benefits, potatoes consuming potatoes, on regular basis, can be extremely harmful to the people suffering from diabetes. This is because the starch in potatoes is made of long, strings of glucose that breaks down rapidly in the intestine and are absorbed in bloodstream. Leading to the sudden spike in blood glucose levels fruit.  Uses produces are loaded with fruit sugar, that causes the sharp rise in blood glucose levels and daily intake of fruit juice has also been shown to increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 18 percent rise ins. Another foot to be avoided in diabetes is reisen's. Although these delicious foods are rich in source of fibers vitamins and antioxidants that neutralize oxidative.  Stress yet, it causes sudden spike in blood glucose level. That is extremely harmful to people suffering from diabetes, french fries, greasy and deep fried foods such as french fries, and chicken nuggets should be avoided at any cost to control diabetes. These foods contain a lot of oil and lead to weight gain. These foods are made with starchy and car Bridge ingredients. That lead to rise in blood.  Was level.

Thereby increasing risk of developing coronary artery disease.  Soft drinks and energy, drinks, sugary soft, drinks, and energy, drinks increases, the risk of developing diabetes. Soft drinks are loaded with calories and lead to weight gain and people who are overweight and obese are at higher risk of developing diabetes. Artificial sweeteners.  Sweetness do more harm than good by affecting blood glucose levels and producing insulin sensitivity. Try to stay away from artificial sweeteners as much as possible. In case you are carving a sweet treat, eat dessert made of real sugar, but keep it in moderation.  Pat cuts of meat fat cuts are red meat, such as pork beef. And lamb are very harmful to diabetic patients.

       " 'L77b57erQ4M': \"Everyone this is the tens beginner workout. Basically over the course of like the last four or five months. I've had a lot of people asked me for a beginners workout. Basically a plan for someone who's never started working out doesn't have a gym doesn't even have weight. So just body weight stuff and this is great for people who either just want to start seeing their muscles increasing a start maybe getting like a little bit of some definition so you can get excited to go into the gym or for people who need to lose  lose some fat because you could you could do this as a cardio thing and lose a lot of fat over the course of you know, a couple of months doing this consistently so going to take in the first exercise right now. So the first exercise we're going to start with is push-ups. Now if you have the ability to you're going to do full form push-ups, but if you don't have the ability to push yourself up 10 times, then you just going to do it from your needs. And so instead of from your toes you're doing for your needs. So it's time for shows all the way down. Make sure you Contracting your chest you feeling your triceps engaged. I like to keep my elbows flared in not flirting tucked in instead of  Even the flared out and bump out 10 think that was 11, but we're about ten then we're moving on to the next exercise. So the second exercise that we're going to do is really actually get your heart rate going. It's gonna be burpees. You know what these are but I'll show you the many ways basically start standing come down. Push your legs back and come back up. And because this is the tens work out, of course, we're doing ten of these  Now we're going on to the third exercise. All right, so now we're doing the third exercise in this third exercise is going to be focusing on your leg muscles instead of cardio. So what we're going to do is alternating lunges each time you come up on both sides.  Is 1 so you need to 10 of those when you do these you want to extend your foot as far as you can forward comfortably land on it not hard. Like I just did landed your he'll come down push through your knee through your heel as you come back up and push back. This should be sort of you should feel your quads your hamstrings and your glutes engaged because you're pushing yourself back instead of when you're doing a walking lunge forward. So 10 of these.  And now we move on to the last exercise of the tens work out. Alright, so as you can see, I'm already starting to sweat a little bit. This is pretty hard party of for anyone especially if you have a little extra weight to throw around and you like my model pose this last exercise is going to be for your abs. It's kind of a crunch but it's like my own style on it. So this is what we're going to do ten of these of course laid out flat you're gonna bring your knees up as you bring your torso up. It's just like this and hands are extended straight. Keep your balance just like that.  Our down keeping your shoulder blades off of the ground and your heels off the grass that your abs are constantly engaged going to do ten of these. Okay, so I'm pretty sweaty. I'm pretty worked up my heartbeats going pretty fast. This is a great exercise really for anyone that's starting out really needs to get a base just start doing something. This is great because you can recycle this and you can do this as much as you want. Also, if you're ever on the road, you can't do anything, you know, you don't have a gym that you can go to you can definitely do this.  Just to do a little bit of something so maintenance work. So you just saw the four exercises that we did for 10 reps each. Once you've done each of those one time that it's one interval. Basically, if you're just starting you haven't done anything in your life do one interval, but you know kind of Judge how you feel you can handle and then every time you work out with this try to try to do another interval, if you think you can if you can handle it do another interval and work your way up until you can do this, you know, 15 times to problem because by that point you could walk into a gym and you know, you can handle things you'd have a little bit of musculature you do.  You know a little bit more about your body plus if you're someone who's a little bit obese. This is a great way to lose fat kind of get some confidence in yourself realize what you're doing realize how to exercise and then you can come to a gym and just be completely comfortable. So there you go guys. You all asked me to make a beginner workout of those are a lot of people to follow me that aren't even into fitness, you know, so this is a great way to kind of segue you guys into that. And if you have any questions about this workout or any questions about anything really leave them in the comments below, you know, I'll answer them may take me a few days, but I'll definitely get there.

       " 'L8AybjTBKF4': \"Puzzle in the complexity of managing diabetes. Not only does the person with diabetes need to manage their insulin dose. They need to consider what their current blood sugar is. They need to look at is exercise planned or not. And then they have to look at the carbohydrate content of the meal. So carbohydrate counting is a method to assure type 1, diabetes, insulin doses are matched to the food, but it can also be implemented in type 2 diabetes, many people with type 2 diabetes.  Use carbohydrate counting to manage portion size.  So introducing the carbohydrate Foods, whether you're talking about grains, fruits, starchy vegetables legumes beverages with carbohydrate desserts with carbohydrate. They all eventually digest into monosaccharides, which enter the bloodstream. So both the carbohydrate amount and type of carbohydrate will affect blood glucose levels.  Carb containing foods in the milk and yogurt group are just that they're not cheese butter or cream. Because when you make cheese, it's just combining the protein and the fat, whereas the milk, and the yogurt have lactose fruits and juices are quite concentrated and simple sugars. There's grains breads. Cereals starchy vegetables, like potatoes and corn, the whole bean family, all added sugars, honey, sweets. And syrups and the desserts made with them are  That people with diabetes have to consider when planning their dose. So, the dose is based on three things, the amount of carbohydrate, and the type that they're about to eat what their current blood sugar level is and their level of physical activity.  So, when using insulin to carbohydrate ratios, the person would be given with the help of an endocrinologist or a doctor to figure out what their doses should be. They would be given a ratio and that ratio would give you information on how to cover the carbohydrate. But also how to correct an elevated blood glucose. So for example, a ratio of 1 to 15 means one unit of Rapid acting insulin for every 15 grams of carbohydrate and a unit for every  Ft /. 100 as written here. In blue means they would take an extra unit for every 50 milligrams per deciliter. Their blood sugar was elevated above their target. And in this case, I chose 100, but these can vary. Somebody who is insulin sensitive such as a type. One typically needs about a unit for every 10 to 20 grams of carbohydrate somebody. With type 2 might use much more because of their insulin resistance. So if we look at this ratio and a planned meal of  D grams of carbohydrate. The person would take a unit for every 15 or six units for the food. The current blood glucose of 200 is elevated above their target of 100 and they would need two units because it's one unit for every 50 milligrams per deciliter over their target. So the dose is comprised of two things and this dose would add up to 8 units.  Why not use sliding scale for type 1? Which was the gold standard for decades. That's all anybody used to do is give a patient, something like this table that says if your blood sugar is between 70 and 100 take 4 units, if your blood sugar is between 101 and 150, take five units, and so forth that has a built-in increase as the blood sugar levels, rise above Target, but you'll notice it doesn't say anything about the amount of carbohydrate being eaten. Now, sliding,  L do such as this may be more appropriate for somebody with type 2 diabetes, who makes their own insulin. They're just very insulin resistant and need a layer of additional insulin to help lower blood sugar. But this isn't going to work very well for a type 1. If you look at these two meals, the same dose cannot possibly cover every meal they eat at that time of day. So on the left, you have an omelet with cheese for sausages. A piece of wheat toast coffee, and the total carbohydrate in that meal.  Is just 15 grams of carbohydrate for units. May be way too much insulin for that the very next day. They might eat a similar volume of food and have a high carbohydrate meal. In this case, a bagel that is about 60 grams of carbohydrate a large banana 30 and a glass of juice 4:30. So they've had the same volume of food, but this meal adds up to 120 grams of carbohydrate and in this case, four units may be way too little so sliding scale just  Doesn't nail it on every meal for somebody who needs more accurate dosing. So, the carb counting tools available to people include the nutrition facts labels on our packaged Goods. Food composition, carb counting lists. There are carb counting books. Some cookbooks will list the recipe and give the portion size until the amount of carbohydrate calories and so forth, fast food restaurants and chain restaurants have brochures. They don't always make them them available at the counter, but you  Can find that information online and there are many websites that can be used for looking up information on food composition as well as apps that can be downloaded to your phone. So looking first at the food labels when we're thinking about carbohydrate counting. We're going to zero in on the serving size. In this case. It says one cup and we're going to look at the total carbohydrate. In this case. It says 30 grams. I'd say the most common mistakes people make is up at the top in.  Is it says 137 grams. That actually is the weight of the product and so often people see that as the carbohydrate. Well, that would be an inaccurate number. The other common mistake is looking to the far right column where you see in bold all lined up, the percent daily value. And this one says 10%, So oftentimes people with visual problems or who don't have good literacy skills. Look at that number and our dosing for that number. And that's incorrect. I, once had  Had a grandmother give insulin to the child for the wait. For example, that would be 137 grams here. When in fact, the dough should have been 30 and that was an urgent situation where they had to feed the child juice and monitor the blood sugar. Every half an hour because of that overdose of insulin frequently, people look at the sugars instead of the carbohydrate, but we need to look at all of the carbohydrate. Not just the sugars, and so sugar and fiber are subsets of the total.  Hydrate of the 30 grams here to come from fiber, three come from sugar, and the remainder come from starch. They just don't need to delineate that on the label and just as an information added, the sugar is here too. It doesn't tell you if it's added white sugar or if there's milk or yogurt in it or if there's fruit in it because in chemistry, any mono or disaccharide would be listed under sugars.  I want to talk about the fiber for a second because fiber doesn't digest. It is not broken down. It pushes through our entire intestinal tract, which is good for the intestines because it stimulates them and it also prevents constipation. But in terms of diabetes, it does not contribute glucose to the blood. So some people should subtract the fiber when they're looking at a label and here's how you would decide. Look at the total carbohydrate here. It's  In G, the fiber is one that's insignificant, whether you're taking a dose for 13 grams, or 12 grams of carbohydrate. It's about the same dose. Whereas the other label the carbohydrate is 10. These are both tortillas. By the way, the other carbohydrate total is 10 grams, but the fiber 7 and if you subtract that you're left with only 3 grams of carbohydrate from starch that are going to digest and get into the bloodstream. Now if you amplify that by having somebody  Buddy that eats three tortillas you can see that that dose mistake could be costly. So if somebody had three of these tortillas and counted it as 30 grams versus what they really should count it as as nine. They would be overdosing on insulin.  So, food list, this is just an example of what people work off of and they have lists that have all the milks group together. All the starch has grouped together, all the fruits group together and each portion size on the page has about 15 grams of carbohydrate. So in time, they learn to memorize the foods that they eat day in and day out. So you can look down the list and see some, things are bigger, like three cups of popcorn. Some things are smaller such as a small apple, orange or banana.  Equaling 15 grams of carb, so I quote the word small because what do you consider small? So many people just say every fruit they eat is 15 grams of carbs because they've seen these lists. But in fact that can't be true, a small apple off of these list is a 4 oz apple. And so, it's important to look at measuring and weighing things accurately. Those measuring cups need to be part of the household food, scales are the next level up. And so,  One somebody Masters measuring and using list, we might move forward with using a food scale. As I said, apples have about three point seven, five grams of carb per ounce. This is an 11 oz Apple. So 11 times 3.75, 41 grams of carbohydrate, you do have access to other lists that are peeled fruits. I like to give them the ones with the peeling on because then they can do do the whole.  Fruit bowl on a weekend when they have time and the whole things done on an Apple, you could write on the sticker with a sharpie. If there's no stickers on it. You can buy them at the dollar store, 200 stickers, and just pop them on things. Let's look at this one. So this is a very small apple and we're going to say each ounce has three point seven, five grams of carb. And this one actually I'm surprised. It's a 4 oz Apple that is really 15 grams of carbohydrate. You can see how small it is.  So when we say a small fruit is 15 grams of carb, it's about the size of a tennis ball to maybe the size of a baseball. If it starts looking like a softball or a grapefruit, that might be as much as double.  Non-starchy vegetables. I wanted to mention things like asparagus, beats, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots. All of these have a little bit of carbohydrate, not as much as the other Foods. A half a cup cooked is about 5 grams of carbohydrate, but that can still be significant for somebody who's dosing insulin. Exactly such as a type one. So, another tool available would be websites and I like Cal King.\",\n",

       " 'LerY4Y1gz5E': \"Metabolic syndrome is probably the most serious medical condition that you haven't heard about yet. So, what is metabolic syndrome? Why is it so serious? And why haven't you heard about it? Here's what you need to know. The metabolic syndrome is a cluster of the most dangerous heart attack risk factors. Namely raised blood glucose, Central adiposity, often called beer belly, abnormal cholesterol, levels, abnormal blood fats. Also called triglycerides and high blood pressure. It is estimated that one in four adults have metabolic syndrome and the condition becomes more common as we get older. So that by the age of 50, nearly a third of adults have metabolic syndrome. So why is metabolic syndrome so important? Well, if you have metabolic syndrome, you are much more likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke much more likely to develop.  Full, blown, diabetes, and much more likely to develop cancer and more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease. All of these conditions are serious, and they are getting far more common, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease have overtaken cancer and heart disease as the leading cause of death in England and Wales in 2016, and the metabolic syndrome, and diabetes are thought to be important risk factors for these conditions. So, how can you check to see if you  Have metabolic syndrome. Well, first of all, get out a tape measure. If you're a man and your waist circumference is more than 94 cm or if you're a woman and your waist is more than 80 cm. You have one of the main features of metabolic syndrome.  If in addition, you have any two of the following, you will be classified as having metabolic syndrome, namely raised blood triglycerides, reduced HDL cholesterol, sometimes known as good cholesterol, raised blood pressure or raised fasting, blood glucose note. If you're a man of South Asian or Indian Heritage, the important threshold for waist circumference is 90 centimeters.  Now, metabolic syndrome has not yet been classified as a disease. It is still regarded as a collection of signs and symptoms, which together are serious risk factors for our most deadly and disabling medical conditions.  Several medical organizations such as the World Health Organization, the independent diabetes Federation and the European group for the study of insulin resistance Define. Metabolic syndrome in slightly different ways. And this adds even more to the confusion about what exactly metabolic syndrome is. However, many experts now, believe that the underlying problem is in metabolic syndrome is insulin resistance. Insulin.  Students develops, when this hormone cannot work properly, when blood insulin levels are abnormally high, and still relatively ineffective in keeping blood glucose levels regulated, properly, metabolic Specialists. Now increasingly use the term insulin resistance syndrome instead of metabolic syndrome.  Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas and it is important in the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats, when sugar and carbohydrates, are eaten insulin, promotes the uptake of glucose from the blood into muscles and fat cells, hence. It is often said that insulin allows cells to use glucose for energy and also to store excess glucose and sugar as glycogen and fat.  When blood glucose levels fall, stored glucose is released for energy from the breakdown of glycogen in the liver, and in the muscles.  Now in the metabolic syndrome, insulin levels are chronically high. That means they never really go down back to normal.  Fasting, blood levels of insulin in the morning are often abnormally, high and insulin levels rise to very high levels. When food is eaten, continuously high levels of insulin, caused the liver cells to store fat resulting in a fatty liver, which cannot function. Normally, as the insulin resistance worsens. The pancreas may not be able to produce enough insulin in response to food and then glucose levels in the blood rise above the threshold for the  Listen to be called diabetic. So why haven't you heard about metabolic syndrome? Well, until recently, the connection between metabolic syndrome and a host of chronic diseases was not fully understood. We now know that insulin resistance is the key until neural until recently. It was very difficult to measure blood insulin levels, but the technology has improved and we can now measure blood insulin levels accurately and we have  Good tests to diagnose, insulin resistance, as well as good strategies to reverse insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. You see once you can measure insulin resistance, you are well on the way to fixing it and monitoring improvement with interventions.  I foresee the emergence of bespoke, metabolic assessments and patient-centered metabolic interventions without drugs or medications for apparently healthy people to reduce the risks of developing high, blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, cancer and dementia. In addition, for those people with these conditions. We can now test for insulin resistance and we can potentially reverse these illnesses.

You need to do things that make you breathe harder and make your heart beat faster. You also need to do activities that make your muscles stronger. So the question is, how much activity do you need to do each week to gain health benefits?  The answer is found in the guidelines for important health benefits. The guidelines recommend that most adults get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity. Such as brisk walking or 75 minutes a week of vigorous intensity aerobic activity such as jogging or an equivalent mix of both moderate and vigorous intensity aerobic activity each week. Don't feel overwhelmed by the amount of physical activity you need to do each week. I know 150 minutes a week sound.  Like a lot of time but it's actually not. That's two and a half hours, barely more time than you spend watching a movie and the good news is that you don't have to do it all at once. In fact, it's best to spread your physical activity out over the week. Now when it comes to meeting the guidelines, you'll be surprised by the variety of activities. You have to choose from almost anything counts as long as it's a moderate or vigorous intensity for at least 10 minutes at a time. Anything less just doesn't count for example. Going for a Brisk. 30-minute walk, five days.  Days, a week gives you 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity or if you can't fit the 30 minutes in all at once, break it up into 10 minute chunks of time during the day. Whatever works. Best. Now, of course aerobic activity is important but so is strengthening your muscles. That's why the guidelines recommend that adults do muscle-strengthening, activities two, or more days a week that work all seven, major muscle groups, the legs, the hips, the back, abdominals chest, shoulders, and the arms.  Whether in the gym or at home, you can strengthen your muscles, in many different ways. Some examples are lifting weights, working with resistance bands or doing activities that use your body weight for resistance, such as push-ups and sit-ups.  The best tip I can give you is to find an activity that you actually enjoy. It's much more likely that you'll stick with it and be sure to check out our other videos for details on how you can live a more active happier and healthier life. I'm Dave patania and my activity of choice is running. So come on. Let's go.\",\n",
       " 'LhXyJCa_b-k': \"Hey guys, in this video. We're going to talk about cortisol resistance and insulin resistance. Now, you may have heard of insulin resistance, which is a pre-diabetic state, but you may have not heard of cortisol resistance. So I'm going to kind of explain what it is. They're both a little bit similar in symptoms. But anytime you have a resistance situation, you have a hormone that is not going into the cells properly. In other words, this the receptor.  Or the supposed to receive the hormone is resistive and it's blocking that hormone from going in. So you have a situation where you have a lot of hormone in the body, but you have no effect. It's not creating the function of that hormone. So you can have symptoms of too much of the hormone and a deficiency of the hormone at the same time. So it's very confusing. So, let's first talk about the adrenal gland. The adrenal gland is a little. There's two glands on top of the kidney right down here.  And the hormone will talk about is cortisol. Cortisol is a stress hormone. All right, and what happens is it counters and it deals with stress. When you have stress over a long period of time, the receptor that supposed to receive that hormone becomes downgraded or attends to block that hormone. It's like a protective mechanism. So here are the symptoms first of high cortisol. And this is kind of like a stage 1, you have belly.  Okay, you have high blood pressure. You have poor sleep. You have loss of protein. Muscle Hair Skin, collagen joint, disc bone. A lot of your protein. Matrix is bone color, high cholesterol, low vitamin D levels acid reflux. Even an ulcer. Those are all symptoms of high cortisol. The symptoms of low, cortisol are inflammation.  So in other words, we need cortisol. You can't live without it, but we don't need too much of it and it's course, whole is one of the main anti-inflammatories. So if you don't have this working in the body, you have a lot of inflammation. Okay, titus's bursitis, tendinitis arthritis, those type of things. Then the immune system is also controlled by the adrenals, the adrenals raise the white blood cell. They help prevent infections, they help you.  He'll with infections interesting. So if you're not having that effect, you can have a lot of immune issues. You can be very susceptible to getting colds and viruses in sicknesses. You can develop autoimmune diseases. Okay, so I mean if you think about it, what do they give people for autoimmune? What are you people for inflammation? And for like, even skin reaction issues? They give him prednisone. What is prednisone? Prednisone is cortisol. It's an adrenal.  Renal hormone allergies, right? Lot of allergy cases that give you prednisone. Like I had when I was 28, that was two years ago. No, I'm just kidding on 51, but when I was 28, I had really bad poison, ivy to the point where I didn't have an injection of prednisone, prednisone is a cortisol. So it helped with the, with the poison ivy. And then, of course, the next year, I get it again and five years in a row. I had to be injected with this cortisone, so,  Really one of the things that drove my health going downward but cortisol is anti-allergic. It also helps. Asthma the lung condition low. Cortisol can also create problems with memory issues, dementia, absent-mindedness. You're driving the street and I'm like, okay, where am I going again? And you're constantly in a state of stress because you don't have the hormones to counter stress. So you have a low tolerance for  Things like that. Okay. So with insulin resistance, you can have symptoms of both and that's why it's really confusing. You get a blood test and it may show, you know too much or not enough. It could be subclinical or doesn't even show up yet because cortisol is on a circadian wave through the day and night. So if they're checking at 8:00 in the morning, well, the problem could be in the at night, you know, so you have to check it every four hours. All right, so it's hard to detect this. I like to go by the symptoms.  And the treatment or the remedies or the rejuvenation for the adrenal is the same. If you have too much or not enough. Okay, except when you get into exercise, okay, but I'm going to create some links down below if you have this, what to do. Okay. Now let's shift over to insulin resistance. This is very interesting because insulin resistance has similar symptoms to the course all resistance, okay.  High insulin creates, you're thirsty all the time, you're urinating on the time. That's high insulin is a diabetic. Stay dry mouth belly fat, high blood pressure. So it's similar your inflamed. You have inflammation. You're tired. Like, after the saying Thanksgiving meal. You want to take a nap, right? You're tired after lunch. You tied at three o'clock in the afternoon. That's an insulin resistance issue.  Pre-diabetic and then we have a memory memory issues in this, this can because there's certain plaquing that occurs in the brain amyloid plaque in which is found in all summers and dementia and even Strokes. So that's the problem with with diabetes. Well, if we go go previous to that it's an insulin resistance situation and like no one's really fixing the precursor for diabetes. They're actually waiting to, you have it monitoring and managing your symptoms. Okay, but Chuck and  Out those symptoms of low, insulin irritable nests, inpatient lightheadedness. Sweet, Cravings, hungry. You can't go long period of time without being so hungry. Headachy anger.  Week. Okay. So with insulin resistance, you have symptoms of both high and both low. So what happens is cells, don't get the insulin and one of the purpose of insolence to drive the nutrition and the fuel in there. So basically, your cells are starving. Okay? And your brain starving. So guess what you going to crave sweets? So like yourselves can really be deficient in this, so that's why even in diabetic situations. You see that they're the extremities of feet that they have tingling on the  Those pain in the toes and the fingers they start getting numbness. Eventually gangrene. You lose your eyesight. I mean, you're starving the body of nutrition because we need insulin, but we don't need too much. All right, and I'll create some links down below of what to do with this situation. One last thing High cortisol. Can then turn your and I'm going to create a separate video on this but High, cortisol can turn your body proteins into glucose which then  Causes insulin resistance and then diabetes. So this can cause that. So, this is all about stress. This is all about sugar. All right, so I guess the motto is avoid stress and sugar. Hey guys, thank you so much for watching.

       " 'LijHvJcVuCI': \"Okay, great. That was wonderful. Christina. Christina said that she's doing this every day in the lab and what she's really doing every day in the lab is curing. Nice diabetes.  She's not caring human diabetes. In fact, the they just started the first clinical trial in humans. And what Christina didn't tell you is that most clinical trials, fail. Mice has been a cancer has been cured in mice, hundreds of times and when those clinical trials are moved to humans they feel so, you know, yes, it's promising. Are we curing them now in Christina's lab? No, we're not.  Christina, argued that there's a lack of donors. If everybody who died was willing to donate their pancreas, could we have enough pancreatic to cure diabetics? You better believe we could because it's only type 1 diabetes that we're thinking about type 2. Diabetes can be controlled by diet and appetite. The number of type 1 diabetics could easily be treated by. If everyone in the world, donated their pancreas on condition of death. So we don't necessarily need to go to these.  Complicated tea bags that have embryonic stem cell produced cells that are going to be data cells. I should also say, one of the ways that Christina knows that she has pluripotent es or IPS cells. Is she takes those cells and inject, some, under the skin of mice and sees if they form tumors,  Because those pluripotent cells form tumors under the skin, called teratomas and the mice died.  So Christine has now going to try and purify some human insulin-producing beta cells from pluripotent cells, but of course they can't purified 100%. There's going to be some contaminating cells and some of those contaminating cells are going to be pluripotent cells to cause tumors. And so Christina will argue that. Yes, we've done some experiments in mice and they don't form teratomas and mice, when we transplant in IPS or ES derived beta cells, but of course, my son only lived for two years.  If it takes three or four years in the 80-year lifespan or nine year, life span of a human for those IPS contaminating cells to form tumors. A two-year-old Mouse is not going to find them. So Christina May and I hesitate to say, may cure diabetes, but she's going to kill you with cancer.  So what's the alternative? There's no cancer producing cells in the islets. When we transplant them in that works. They may just have to have multiple transplants. The autoimmune problem. That, that is at the basis of type 1. Diabetes is going to be a problem. Both for the types of cells that Christina is making as well as for the islets, because she's putting them in these tea bags, but, these tea bags break.  They're not perfect. And in fact, they they they have a hard time getting all the nutrients into the bags and it's possible that if enough nutrients get into our blood vessels Pierce through the bags, then the immune system will get in as well and attack those beta cells that are in the lucky bags.  So, the real future.  The real future is not embryonic stem cells or IPS cells. It's a secret population in the islets. It turns out that if you look at all the beta cells about point five percent of all the beta cells aren't mature beta cells in the adult pancreas, their pancreatic stem cells that if you isolate them can actually pull if Ur 8 in a dish and make huge numbers of new insulin, positive cells.  And so, the real cell type, I think for treating type 1, diabetes is going to be an adult pancreatic stem cell and there's a few advantages. This cell has one is, doesn't make tumors to it. Only makes pancreatic cells. One of the other things that Christine didn't tell you is course the es and IPS cells make sixty or seventy percent in some producing beta cells, but they make other types of cells to they make some bone cells. They make, you know, muscle cells who wants to be injecting bone and muscle cells into the into the body. No one.  Do that pancreatic stem cells. I do pancreatic stem cells. Only make pancreatic cells.  We know that those cells can actually work in some forms of some animal models of diabetes. It turns out that if you don't cause an immune reaction, but kill off 80% of the beta cells with a special genetic, trick the stem cells, that survive can actually repopulate the beta cells in Vivo and reverse the diabetes caused by a drug injection. So these cells have the ability to treat diabetes adult pain.  Stem cells. And the problems that Christina has with immune the autoimmune attack is going to be a problem. Both for the solution. I'm suggesting as well as the solution that Christine is suggesting. So the future is not es Drive cancer producing cells. The future is adult, pancreatic stem cells. Thanks. See what I meant when I said it's tough, but now I understand why you said to me. Do you want to go first?  Okay, I'm going to address all of these points. First of all, we do not, unfortunately, we do not live in a perfect world where everybody decides to donate their organs. So we will not be able to cure everyone with type 1, diabetes with transplantation and second of all, yes, we are curing mice around the world. But because we are launching clinical trial in the US and Canada soon. I think we're going to be  Soon seeing the fact that we can cure patients with type 1 diabetes. When Derek says that we're using cancer producing cells. This is actually not true. We and others are becoming really good at generating, this pancreatic cells. And so very rarely, of course, it's a possibility, very rarely this population of cells that we transplant, right?  Now, in the mice will form a tumor. We have a collaboration with Scientists in Edmonton showing that even if you have a tumor, this tumor will not spread into the animal. But would you imagine the FDA approving? Something that could form a tumor in killing the person know. And that's why we have a very good device. When Derek said to you that the device break. This is a lie, because they know they have to  Tested the device. They've tested the device with, I don't know exactly what they put inside by the tested. How much, how many cells it would take for this device to break and it would have to bulge really a lot. Something that because the device will be transplanted Under the Skin, the patient would notice, right. So you will be able to remove the device before it bursts and before it destroys, you know, it releases the content. So I think in terms of safety  Safety, we have a very good solution. I do agree that maybe we don't have the best device in terms of supporting the cells inside. But as we speak now, there is many companies and many universities around the world. There are trying to define the perfect device, something that will allow the cells to Survive and Thrive and function. So I think, you know, we can only get better in terms of cell preparation and you know and device to treat.  Quan diabetes. This is going on. We're not going to start it. It's going to soon change the way we see and treat this disease and at the same time. I'm just going to use one more second. We're actually going to use the cells. We're going to use IPS cells from patients with type 1 diabetes in in the lab to study how the disease happens because it's an autoimmune disease. We want to study how the cells of the immune system attack that  Disease and eventually figure out ways to stop the disease from happening. And so I think that will be the future way to actually cure the disease. So I'm going to leave it to Derrick. Now. I think Christina may have too much faith in big government and big science. She said, can you imagine the government approving? A drug that would cause cancer. The government proved fluid amide?  Right, which caused birth defects, and short Limbs, and all kinds of problems in kids. I think there's a history of the government approving therapies that end up being worse than better.  It's part of the problem is that people do experiments in mice? And as I said, mice live for two years and yes, they don't get cancer or they don't have other deficits in two years but humans live for 80 years. So are we going to approve a cancer-causing es IPS cell that may not cause a tumor and burst out of the tea bag in a year. But if you give it five years, it's going to do. It is going to burst out. It's going to go all over the place and you're going to kill them with cancer.  Christina mentioned that they're getting very good at convincing es and IPS cells to become beta cells, but what she didn't say is the best enrichment. She's got is sixty percent of the cells that are produced from an esri PSL become insulin-producing beta cells. And even when they become insulin-producing beta cells, they're not as exquisitely sensitive to glucose in their release of insulin, as are the cells in the adult eyelets.  Or as are the cells produced by the stem cells that are in the adult pancreas. When you, when you get them to proliferate and make new beta cells, those cells are exquisitely, sensitive to the levels of glucose and release insulin exactly in the right amounts. So I think that although there's promise and there's hope I think the hope and big government. And big science is not going to be the answer. I think the answer is going to be in using the endogenous system using the endogenous.  Cells in the pancreas to eventually in the short term will be transplanting them. Take out the adult pancreatic stem cells from the islets, pull, if rate them, make insulin cells, put them back. But in the long term, the real solution is going to be to have the stem cells remake, the pancreas and reproduce the beta cells from the inside of the body. This is the real hope of stem cell biology. In general. Is once you realize there are adult stem cells and tissues in the body. Can we convince them to rebuild an organ or tissue from?  From the inside, not from transplants in surgery, but from giving drugs, that will then cause those cells to proliferate and and turn into the types of cells we want. So I think this is the real future of treatments for diabetes. Thanks very much.\",\n",

       " 'NAAzs4C-lQ': \"A connection on it that fits perfectly on your hose threads. So we'll put that on. So now that it's on real tight. I'll turn on the water and we'll see that this is going to about just over 50. Yes. I know for some reason kind of fluctuates when you do that, but  It's pretty accurate. Now. That's pretty low. Usually you want to be no more than about 85 PSI. You can check your local codes building codes and see what it is. It is it your area? But generally 80-85 is about the high range and where you want to be and you can go lower. If you don't mind less water pressure in your house. It's not really going to affect too much and it might save you a bit of money. Like when my  Leave the hose running all day long, and I don't notice it. Well, if it's it.  50 PS. I am not a teeth and my water bill is going to be less. But anyway, some gauges, let me zoom on the gate here.  Okay, this this gauge cost under 10 bucks. I think it was around 750 that included shipping, bought it online and the a little bit higher end ones will have another arm on it and the red one. It's usually smaller. And what that will do is measure the high end of the water pressure. A lot of times water pressure can fluctuate at different times of the day and at night, maybe one less people are using water in your area. You're going to get more.  Sure, sometimes that happens. And so, if you leave this on, and this goes up and down, well, went by the time you check it again, wherever that red line is. That was your max water pressure for the period that you left it. So anyway, you can hook this up here. Now. Let's say you did have a secondary water system. And this is not going to help you to hook it up to your house. So can also hook it up to your water heater. I'll take this off and you can see how that's done.  All right. At the base here. Water heater. I have to hear. Hopefully, you see this little spigot, and a lot of times water, heaters will collect a bunch of crud at the bottom, but I don't want to push into my gauge so I'm gonna undo this.  A little bit of water out. Yeah. Let's see if we can see this here.  Nasty. It is.  See that?  It's kind of brown murky. There's little Gravelly bits floating in there. So I'm going to let a little bit of this out.  Yeah, that's pretty gross.  Alright, that's looking clear enough.  Okay, so we're going to put on the gauge.  All right, outside was about 55.  Let's see how inside.  It's a bit less. That's kind of normal. This is about 45, so it's not rare to have it not be.  The same on the inside as it is on the outside, water heaters.  I can do that. Also, how close you are to the main valve will affect the pressure, but it generally gives you an idea.  All right. Hopefully you can find something that looks like this on your property. I'm in my cold storage here. And this is a concrete wall. We're below ground. And right here is the water coming in from the city line. And it's this copper, pipe comes through the wall and splits off. This line goes to this piece here, which is called a prv or pressure reducing valve.  And then the pressure gets capped at a certain level and then goes up and splits off and does all the pipes and things in a goes to all the different facets in the house. This Branch goes up to run, the sprinkler line. And this is a drain for letting the water out of the sprinkler line. This doesn't matter, but this does not do the hose. The hose comes off in my house on this line. So,  And this is the line that's regulated. And this is what will adjust your water pressure. And right here. There's a screw you can insert your flat-head screwdriver there and undo the bolt. So, we you need a wrench and a screwdriver, to adjust this.  Okay, this says size three quarter inch set at 50 psi. So that's actually accurate and the range here says it can go up to 75 PSI.  So let's increase this a bit. I'd like just a little bit more water pressure. So to do that, you undo this nut.  Going to hold this in place.  Go counterclockwise on the nut.  You don't go all the way just a bit and releasing that will allow you to spin this. Now, spinning, this clockwise increases the water pressure and counterclockwise decreases it.  And you might want to count the amount of turns just so you have a reference of how much you did. So, I don't know if it's the same with all models. But with this type spinning, it counterclockwise increases. So we're going to do that now.  One turn.  So loosen this a bit, two turns.  And let's just go check and see what that did. How much to turns will adjust the water pressure.  Okay, that bumped it right up to 60.  And I'll try that out in my house. See how I like the pressure. And if I want to put it up a little bit more, I can that pump or that reducing valve will go up to 75. And so hopefully this video has helped you.

       " 'OeQLJCVOdM': \"Okay, it's actually the more important reason is that blood pressure is one of the leading risk factors when it comes to cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular disease, is the number one leading cause of death globally. It's literally like the, the number one thing that kills people in the world cardiovascular disease. And if you have a device like a phone that you can hold in your hand that can measure blood pressure, like that, that could change the world that could literally save lives. So I wanted to see what this thing could do. I wanted to  see if this thing was accurate. I wanted to see if the sensor worked like I thought it would work. And yeah, there's some good things and some bad things but we're just going to go through real quickly. So to make this whole thing work, you need to get an app. It's specific to the S9, the S9 plastic. It doesn't work on other phones. It's called my BP lab and it's made in conjunction with Samsung. It's through some University and it's the only app that currently uses the blood pressure sensor. Now, this may change in the future. But as of today, the middle of March, that's the only way they can use this blood pressure sensor on the S9 and the S9 +.  Okay. So when you set this thing up, the first thing you'll notice is that this is a research study and the data that this app measures and collects is used to kind of see the relationship between stress and health. It's an interesting study. But I mean, I'm here just for the blood pressure measurement. That's all I really care about. Okay, so you have to sign a whole bunch of consent things, but it's pretty easy to get it up and running. Now, the first time you use this, it asks you to do a base measurement for your blood pressure and that's where things get a little bit weird. The app doesn't tell you an actual number like you  Don't know. Your blood pressure value. You just know that that's your base measurement and any subsequent measurement that you do with the app. It just tells you if it's gone up or down as a percentage never actually gives you a number. Now. There is a way to get a number into the system. You have to calibrate it using external hardware. So you need a blood pressure cuff or blood pressure machine of some sort or you can go to your physician and get it done. But you can input an actual known measurement for your base blood pressure. So that the app knows what that base value is. So every time you re measure it, if it goes up or down, it'll kind of just calculate what the difference.  Isn't just give you the new updated value. So, the app doesn't actually measure blood pressure. It just kind of measures the change in blood pressure. So if you have like a base value that the app knows, it can give you a number but if you don't, you don't have an actual measurement, so the sensor uses PPG, to try to measure the blood pressure. It's basically an optical measurement. The sensor has a couple of LEDs and it measures the way that the light reflects off of your finger tip when it's covering the sensor to obtain a value. So I calibrated this thing to my blood pressure, but when I use the app on my  Members and Friends. Some of them who I know have drastically different blood pressures for me the app and the sensor just weren't picking up proper differences. Now, it is possible or even very likely that the app kind of caters to the user like because it's calibrated to me. It wouldn't work on other people. I think that's very likely but I did test this thing out in a different way. So what I did was I just exercise and exercise does elevate blood pressure, a bit and the app does pick up that increase in blood pressure, but it doesn't seem to be as accurate as a blood pressure cuff. Now, it could be a limitation with the  Actual sensor like maybe it's not designed to measure elevated blood pressure from exercise because that's like not how you want to measure blood pressure normally, but I mean, that's just that's the only way that I can really test or pretend to test its accuracy. Now, there are other limitations one. I noticed that cold fingers don't work very well, dry fingers as well. Like I have can some dry hands from the winter and just like, it doesn't always work reliably. And the app itself, mentions that certain skin, pigmentations may not work, but I think the big limitation comes from the  Answer itself, or at least the algorithm that the sensor is using to calculate blood pressure. So I think it's weird that it doesn't measure blood pressure. But I did a little research on just whole technology and that seems to be an issue with the tech. Like there's a feasibility study on this stuff and they're saying that you could measure the relative variation of blood pressure, but they couldn't find the absolute pressure value. Like I'm not even comfortable saying that this thing can measure blood pressure. It can measure the change in blood pressure, but it can't actually measure your blood pressure. At least not with the current iteration of this app. Now, I think  This app and this Hardware in this whole thing, can get way better. And I think that may be why Samsung is doing this partnership with the university. Like, maybe they're going to be taking the data from like all the people that I've been using this app and using it to improve the sensor or the algorithm that is used in this sensor and like that could just make it better over time. But right now the app and the sensor feel kind of mediocre to me. So the idea of a phone that you could use to check your blood pressure intermittently is awesome. And I think for some very very rare cases.  It could technically save a life even in its current iteration. Like if you were someone that didn't know anything about your blood pressure and he started using this thing and you notice that it was elevated. You could kind of do something to monitor or manage that. That's cool. But for the vast majority of people that are interested in this phone, like I would not consider the blood pressure monitor a substantial feature, at least not enough to Warrant the purchase of this phone because of that feature. Okay. Hope you guys enjoyed this video. A thumbs up if you liked it subs. You loved it. See you guys next time.\",\n",

So just relax it and then give it a nice pull until you feel a stretch in your  Your cap areas. You want your need to be straight. So some people might bend it a little bit, but that's not getting that stretch in your calf. So keep the leg nice and straight. Feel that stretch there and hold that stretch for about 30 seconds. Take a little break in between and then do three of those. So just really getting that stretch getting that flexibility in the feet, is really important because a lot of times when you have that neuropathy in your feet, you tend to not feel where your feet are and sometimes  Stumble, trip and fall. And so having good flexibility and strength helps that out as well.  The next set of exercises. You you want to have your heel free moving. So if you've got a foam roll, or if you want to sit on the edge of something and let your foot hanging off, you want to be able to move that. He'll, so if you're flat on the floor or something, you won't have quite as much movement, but this time what you're going to do is just an ankle pump. So pulling your foot up and then pushing it down. So, really just getting some good movement in the ankle. So you don't have to  Fast. Make sure you get a good push at the end. Good, pull at the top and just start off with about 10 of those so you don't have to do a whole lot. Then the next thing is going to be ankle circles. So now you're just making a circle at your ankle. It's not your whole leg. Sometimes people want to kind of move the whole leg try, and keep the leg staying still, and get most of that movement at the ankle. So do about 10 one way and then reverse it.  It and do it the other way.  So just do 10 of about each of those. So the next set of exercises are going to be lying down.  You're just going to do a straight leg raise. So you want to keep the leg nice and straight and locked out to keep it straight. If you pull up your toes that helps keep it locked out and keep that knee straight as well with a straight leg raise. You just want to lift it to about the height of the other side. So you don't have to kick it super high. You just have to get about that much Motion in there and then slowly come back down. You really trying to control this movement. So you're not using momentum just to kick it up and down. Yuri.  Want to control that work, those muscles, get everything, nice and strong in there. So just start off with about 10, then you can do a couple sets of 10 and then work your way up from there. So you do both sides, and then you're going to do what we call hip abduction, or kicking your leg out to the side. The leg on the bottom can be kind of bent but you want your whole body to be in a straight line? A lot of times people, if they kick up they'll kick.  Kind of forward, but that's not really working. Those hip abductor muscles. So pull your toes tight again and almost lead with your heel slightly back behind you. So you're kicking back that way. So a lot of people want to do that. But again, that's not getting those abductor muscles. So make sure you're leading with that heel and going back just a little bit. So again just start off with about 10 and then you can work your sets up to two or three and then just kind of work your way up with  Reps from there.  Alright, the next exercise you're going to be standing up. The next exercise is going to be a heel toe raise. And again, this is just to kind of strengthen those ankle muscles and give that that increase circulation. So hold on to something sturdy, a sturdy chair or a countertop if you have it for some extra balance because again, A lot of times when you don't have that feeling down there, your balance is off just a little bit. So go up, nice and slow and come down with a controlled motion. So it's not just going up and down, but really controlling that  Making those muscles work and then pull your toes up when you come back down. So you're just going to go all the way up with the heels. Slowly come down and then pull the toes up. So, just start off again with about 10 of these and then you can work your way up to 15 to 20. If those become easy, then you can go just to one foot and still coming up. Nice and slow down and then pull your toes up. So just going back and forth.  And then, the last exercise is for balance, because again, that's one of those things that you lose when you don't have that feeling down there or you always have that tingling pins and needles feeling or some numbness in there. So, just a simple stand on one foot. Again, have something nice and sturdy, you might have to start off with two hands. That's okay, try and get to at least 10 seconds, work your way up to 30 seconds, or even a minute. If that becomes easy, then you can go to one.  And and then you can even go to no hands. If all of that becomes easy and you're switching back and forth a couple times, and there's no problems with that. Then, if you really want to challenge yourself, you can try closing your eyes. And again, you can see down at my ankle, with my eyes closed. It's moving a lot and that's pretty normal. That's just those muscles trying to find the balance, especially when you don't have that feeling to help you find that balance. So there you have it.

The patient's we want to focus on our patients, who are suspected of having the disease. So we can make the appropriate diagnosis, prevent any kind of invasive and potentially damaging procedures with patients, who do not have the diagnosis. And those that do start offering different treatment strategies, including hopefully inventive and new strategies.  Veggies that we expect to develop here at the medical center. One of my focus of research and adventurist is a procedure, called a total pancreatectomy and islet auto-transplantation. We're very, basically, we removed the patient's pancreas. Obviously, in highly selected individuals. We extract the islets that produce different hormones, such as insulin and give them back to the patient. In this way. We remove an offending organ that we believe is causing the disease process in the chronic pain.  At the same time. We hope to prevent the development of diabetes, which is otherwise inevitable if you just remove the pancreas and not only is there a lack of general knowledge about making the diagnosis and treating this disease, but also it's a source of frustration for patients, for patients, family members and for Physicians. So, I really think that patients need to be proactive. Need to find that. There are many other people who are studying this to try to make their lives better at the Ohio State University, Wexner Medical Center.

       " 'qbL-UhhyPk': \"Right? And there are certain things that I miss like respect, but there is a very good reason. I bring it up because there were 1.6 million people in the UK that suffer with eating disorders. It's probably more because a lot of people feel embarrassed to talk about it and a lot of people don't realize that their suffering and that was exactly the same for me. A lot of my friends when I kind of slipped into all of this ask me. How is losing so much weight so quickly? And I  Yes. Yeah, I was embarrassed. So I used to tell them. It was a combination of the Atkins diet, coupled with being vegetarian.  Just sounds much nicer, right? Cuz by trade, I am a stand-up comic and I love the, the unique ability that comedy has to reach people. And I really wanted to use that in order to help and in order to change how we see mental health, and it was, it was a difficult show to write. It was a really tricky one because it had to be funny but also had to be informative as well.  Well, and obviously I wanted to be sensitively we didn't always get there the valance right when we took it on tour to the Lester Comedy Festival of the first reviews, said that a bit that I did on bulimia, was to gag heavy. So it's Energon domestic violence lacks punch lines, right? But it's absolutely true. And I want to promote change especially towards mental health because we haven't changed our attitude in the UK to mental health. Since the  Never really. I mean like then we'd have freak shows. Now. We have reality TV, right? We just haven't come that far, and I wanted to use that and I'll never forget. The first time I ever tried this show, right? And it was awkward. It was horrible. It was awkward. Everyone was really and it wasn't ready. And after the show a woman came up to me and she stood there and she said you weren't really anorexic though, you know where you and I can. So I can now prevent are you?  Him me fat and I said, it's all absolutely true. And she just turned around. She walked off and I thought I've offended this woman, right? And that is the last thing that I want to do, but then five minutes later, she came back and she stood there and she said I can help you and it can help you get over this. And then from behind her back. She produced a packet of crisps.  Right. Lloyd the answer to this neurological, psychological mental health disorder was a packet of monster Munch, right? And it was only, then that I realized how little people actually know about this. So I decided to start telling my story. And for me, this all began when I was 17, and I just got the lead role in a play. It was a play called Sparkle shark. I'm not  Gay. Right. I'm as surprised as you. So, he's my boyfriend, but and I'm not homophobic either, you know, some of my best friends enjoy musicals, but  I am of course, get it over very left wing person. Very liberal. And the only thing I can't tolerate is gluten, right? But I got this role in this play and I had to appear topless and I guess I was the first time I've ever had to think about my body. So I decided to lose a little bit of weight, right? I just did the usual thing. Cut out snacking, just have breakfast dinner and tea and I lost a bit of weight wanted to lose a little bit more so I cut up breakfast just at dinner and tea lost a lot of weight. I wanted to lose a bit more and then cut up breakfast and  A just had tea and kind of lost a bit more and it was a great way to save money on food bills, right? Although what I did losing weight. I also lost a nectar points. It's not all happy families.  But as I lost the weight, something incredible happens and I got noticed by this one. Amazing beautiful, wonderful, awesome girl. And for legal reasons, I'm not going to name her. I'll get within 50 foot over after this goes online. But all you need to know is she was amazing. We started dating and I fell in love and she became my heroin right by which I mean she was addictive, exciting and Blum.  But like heroin she also became a cause for me to lose weight. She became an inspiration to draw me on to lose more, more of my fat. Like I'm not that she ever made me. I really want to get that across as well. If she actually never actively made me lose weight, but she hated that I was skinnier than her, right? I'll never forget a long conversation like just like bum look big in this. So no Dave.  No, but this. But you have to understand that in my mind are correlated getting skinny. We getting this incredible girl, right? So in my mind, I correlated getting skinny with being good looking, skinny, men, success. I know that's mental now. No, I understand. No girl has ever been asked. What do you look for in the ideal blog or rickets? But in my mind that made sense inevitably when we broke up and she broke my heart, that was when it spiraled out of control.  Because if we're talking about change, one of the things that I want to change is anorexia is not to do with vanity, and it's very little to do with weight. It's about addiction Obsession and control. So for example, I became absolutely obsessed with exercising any time at eaten anything. No matter how much I would run upstairs to my room. I would do 50 pushups. I'd do 50 sit-ups and I would do 20 squats, right? And it was then that my mom, and dad's realized that something was up.  Now they never approach me. They never said anything to me about this and I didn't know the reason until till I asked them recently, and I said to my mom, why? When you knew something was up, why with the exercise? Why did you never say anything to me? She gave the most. Beautiful answer should Dave when your teenage son keeps on running up to his room and all you can hear is rhythmical banging.  Followed by repeated grunting right? You tend not to ask questions right? Joy though is really sweet and don't like that. Just put his hand on her shoulder went. I thought you're a sex pest. Hmm.  Sex past, you never expected those words at tedx. But also, I became obsessed with weighing myself as well on a neurological level. So, I started wearing myself in the morning, but then I started wearing myself in the evening, see how much my weight fluctuated and then midday to inspire me to eat less and on average about 5 times a day. I used to run upstairs lock my door and weigh myself. So five times a day are used to lock myself away. That do I convert?  Islam, right. When he found out what was going on. He said I thought I was gonna have to buy you a Koran right? Said, Dad. Look, we've been over this. I'm vegetarian. Right? It's pronounced quorn slight side note on that. When we did the barium Comedy Festival. Lovely Muslim fellow came up to me after the show and he said, I really enjoy the show is absolutely lovely. But you are, you're very weak person because what you call anorexia Isla Vista, just call Ramadan.  Really nice. So I also, I also became obsessed with calories as what obsessed with calorie counting and to reduce calories. I've reduced portion sizes. So what I called Sunday lunch, everyone else just called tap ass, right? And I because it was weird for Mom and Dad at this point in time. I'm cheaper to feed than the cat was right. And they didn't know what to do. They went and sought help in the church and try to like, drag me along as know, where I was gonna go nowhere near that.  Place, right Bread and Wine. Talk about empty calories, right? I heard stories of Miracles as entirely, an impressive, just of Five Loaves two, fishes. 5,000 people that's plenty to go around, you know, because I didn't realize I've got a problem until I ended up in hospital and I ended up in hospital due to coffee loading.  I'm sorry side. Now, on that in case, you don't know what that is coffee. Loading is where you substitute food for coffee, because coffee gives you all of the energy but none of the calories of food. Now, some of you might not realize about coffee, is that coffee. Reduces your pulse rate when you don't eat because you've got no fuel in your body, that reduces your pulse to and mine got down to about 46. Beats a minute. If you get anywhere below 40, it was medically known as heart block.  Unfortunately, it's incompatible with life.  So, I got rushed to the hospital and as I sat there, I got talking to this building at this Builder, it was going so well.  Do they fix that? And the add it right? Just to ruin it. I'm going to do on this side. Now. The editors gonna have a Madison field X. So, where are we? Serious Point? Thank you very much. So I was there, I was talking to, this Builder is a lovely bloke and it turns out he was there because he'd circular sword through his femur, right?  And after a while we got to talking and he said, anyway enough about me. What about you? Why are you here? And let me tell you, nothing is more embarrassing in life than when you look at a bloke who's Bleeding Through the lower part of his body and you go. Why am I here? Oh, too much coffee in it. You look like a bit of a word that I'm not allowed to say, right? Because it is bizarre and I anorexia is a big problem. Affects people like Kelly Clarkson.  Lee Allen Victoria Beckham, it's a huge problem. You know, it's responsible for a lot of rubbish music.  And I there is a famous female. Anorexics. I asked my housemate if he could name many famous male anorexics and he just went Gandy. No, because I think there is a gap in the market for the first famous male anorexic.

       " 'Ss1XdHx_8M': \"As soon as you employ this process, you start to see that you're able to eat much larger quantities of carbohydrate coming from fresh fruits. And fresh vegetables for smaller. Insulin. Use, I'll repeat that more carbohydrate for Less. Insulin.  We just got back from one of our Retreats. We hold these Retreats a couple of times per year and it's an opportunity for people with Type 1. Diabetes Type 1 and a half diabetes pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes to come together and learn about the power of low-fat plant-based whole food nutrition for significant improvements in insulin sensitivity, and we've held multiple of these Retreats before and every single time. We're able to promote a significant Improvement in blood glucose value.  A reduction in insulin use and a reduction in insulin sensitizing oral medication and we do it using the power of food. Now, at our latest Retreat, we got a total of 14 people living with diabetes, seven of whom were living with insulin dependent diabetes. Now, in this article, we're going to go into detail about the results that each one of these people achieved in improving their insulin sensitivity in as little as four days. That's right. We arrived on Thursday where they're all day Friday, all day.  Saturday all day Sunday, you go home on Monday and you would think to yourself well in four days. How much positive change can you really get in improving? Your insulin sensitivity? Take a look below at the results that each one of our insulin-dependent diabetic. So achieved. Now, let's go in a little bit of detail here and understanding what is insulin sensitivity in the world of low-carbohydrate nutrition, what you'll be told over and over and over again, is that the only thing that matters is how much insulin you're using per day?  That's why all the literature out there is showing you how to minimize your carbohydrate intake so that you can minimize your insulin use in the world of insulin sensitivity. However, your insulin use is just one variable the other variable, which you have to take into account is your total carbohydrate consumption. Insulin sensitivity is defined as your total carbohydrate intake divided by your total insulin use and a span of 24 hours and in this mastering diabetes retreat,  We do is we teach people how to migrate towards a low fat diet because as soon as you achieve a low fat diet, then the amount of carbohydrate that you can consume that your body can tolerate that your digestive system and muscles and liver can metabolize starts to go up. So that means less fat more carbohydrate. So, as soon as you employ this process, you start to see that you're able to eat much larger quantities of carbohydrate coming from fresh fruits and fresh vegetables for  A smaller insulin use. I'll repeat that more carbohydrate for Less insulin. Now. Our first Retreat attendee attended, the retreat, eating 150 grams of carbohydrate in her previous diet and she used a total of eighty eight point two units of insulin, which means that her 24-hour insulin sensitivity was about 1.7.  During the retreat. We instructed her to increase your carbohydrate intake while reducing her fat intake. She was able to consume an average of two hundred fifty seven grams of carbohydrate. And her insulin use fell to 58.6 units for a 24-hour, insulin sensitivity of 4.4. So you can see that hurt change in insulin sensitivity over this four-day period was two hundred and fifty eight percent. This is what happened in the first four days.  Imagine what happens as soon as she returns to her normal life and continues this approach. Her insulin use is likely to consent continue falling and her carbohydrate intake is likely to continue increasing as she controls her blood glucose with more and more Precision. Now, our second attendee increased her insulin sensitivity, by a total of three hundred and nine percent. And she did this by increasing her carbohydrate intake, only by about 50 grams per day, but as you can see, her total insulin use  Went from 50 units per day all the way down to 22 units per day. So what that means is that she's eating more carbohydrates, but she cut her insulin use in half and only a four-day period. And as a result of that, her insulin sensitivity, increased by total of three hundred and nine percent. The third person increased her carbohydrate intake from an average of about 200 grams per day all the way up to about 300 grams per day. And in this process. She also cut her insulin use by 50%  Sent. You can see here. She started out using a total of 60 units per day divided about in half between basil, involves and reduced it all the way down to 30 units per day.  As a result, she increased her insulin sensitivity by total of two hundred, and ninety. Nine percent are next attendee, increased her carbohydrate intake by to fold. In other words. She started to eat double the amount of carbohydrate that she ate. When she previously came 208 G vs about 110 grams previously. As a result of that, her insulin use fell from 43.6 units per day all the way down to twenty seven point six units per day.  Her an increase in her total insulin sensitivity of about a hundred and sixty-two percent.  This gentleman increased his carbohydrate intake from 275 grams per day all the way up to 400 and 22 grams per day. And in the process, he was able to cut about eight units of insulin off of his standard Baseline of 37 units per day. What that means is that his insulin sensitivity went from a 7.4, all the way to a fourteen point four, which is a change of about a hundred and ninety-three percent.  Our next attendee increased her carbohydrate intake by about 50 percent. She went from about 100 grams per day to about 142, grams per day. Now, you'll notice here that her insulin use actually slightly went up. And the reason for that is simple, before she came to the retreat. She was using only basal insulin 0 bowl, is units per day.  In the retreat, we showed her how to decrease her basil, use of insulin. And in the process she found that she needed a little bit more, bolus insulin. So her total insulin use actually climbed from 18 units per day to about 23 units per day. Despite that slight, increase in her, insulin usage, her instance, sensitivity still went up. So in the first four days, she noticed about 111 percent increase in her insulin sensitivity.  So you can see in each of these situations. How adopting, a low-fat plant-based Whole Foods approach makes significant changes in a very short period of time. Now, each of these attendees have gone back to their life has gone back to their daily routine but done. So by changing the food that they're eating and changing their movement patterns. According to what they learned while at the retreat. What you're looking at here is just the tip of the tip of the tip of the iceberg, because this four-day period.  A lot of these individuals is just a launching Point into a brand new lifestyle that leads to improved insulin sensitivity over the course of time. Now, we like, to talk about the fact that this is just biology. We understand the biology of diabetes and insulin resistance better than most people. And as a result of that, simply by integrating a low-fat plant-based Whole Foods approach, we can see dramatic differences in a short period of time, that then lead to dramatic differences in the long-term. Now, whether you're interested in participating in a coaching program,  I'm showing up to one of our Retreats or just doing this on your own, the world is your oyster. Keep in touch with us. Let us know how we can help you and we hope that we can get the same results for you that you saw for all their other retreating attendees. Thanks for listening.\",\n",
       " 'LtdWg4ygm_E': \"Diabetic nephropathy refers to the kidney damage caused by both type 1 and type 2 diabetes because of the growing number of people affected by diabetes. Diabetic nephropathy is currently the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in most developed countries around the world.  Each kidney has millions of nephrons Each of which is served by a tiny capillary bed called the glomerulus. The tiny arterial that approaches the glomerulus is called the afferent arteriole, a, for approaching. And the arterial that exits, the glomerulus is called the efferent arteriole, E4, exits. The glomeruli are tiny cluster of capillaries, that are physically supported by mesangial cells.  So when blood is filtered, it moves through the endothelium lining the capillary then through the basement membrane, and then through the epithelium lining the nephron and finally into the nephron itself, at which point, it's called filtrate. Now, the endothelium has pores that keep cells from entering the filtrate and the basement membranes negatively charged, and repels other negatively charged molecules and proteins like the protein albumin.  Furthermore, the epithelium has a special cell type called a poda site, which looks like an octopus. Because it has foot processes that wrap around the basement membrane, which leaves, tiny gaps between its octopus, like projections called, filtration slits.  In diabetes mellitus, there's an excess of glucose in the blood because it can't get into cells and when blood gets filtered through the kidneys, some of that excess glucose starts to spill into the urine called glycosuria.  In addition, when there's a lot of glucose in the blood, it also starts sticking to proteins in the blood, a process called non enzymatic, glycation because no enzymes are involved.  because glucose can get through the endothelium this process of glycation can also involve the basement membrane of small blood vessels, which makes it thicken  The process particularly affects the efferent arteriole causing it to get stiff and more narrow a process called hyaline arteriolosclerosis.  This creates an obstruction that makes it difficult for blood to leave the glomerulus, which increases pressure within that glomerulus.  At the same time, the afferent arteriole dilates which allows more blood flow into the glomerulus and increases pressure even more.  High pressure in the glomerulus leads to an increase in the glomerular filtration rate, which is just the amount of blood filter through per minute.  This is the first stage of diabetic nephropathy called hyperfiltration.  In response to this high pressure State, the supportive mesangial cells secrete more and more structural Matrix, which expands the size of the glomerulus. This Matrix deposition and mesangial expansion can happen. Uniformly, or it can result in little nodules within the Miss. Angie. Mm called Kimmel steel Wilson nodules which are tiny balls of protein.  The thickening of the basement membrane counter-intuitively, makes it more permeable, allowing proteins like albumin through that, otherwise would have been filtered out.  It makes sense, though. If you think about our octopus friend again, as the glomerulus, expands the legs of the octopus naturally have larger gaps between them. In other words, the filtration slits, widen making it easier for substances to slip through.  So in the end, the key abnormalities in diabetic nephropathy are thickened glomerular basement, membrane mesangial expansion, Kimball steel, Wilson, nodules, and disruption of the podocytes.  Eventually these changes damage, the glomerulus so much that it's unable to filter blood normally and the glomerular filtration rate decreases.  Typically diabetic nephropathy starts quietly with no symptoms during the hyperfiltration phase but over time as more and more. The nephrons are affected. The kidney becomes less and less effective at filtering. The blood into the urine.  And the glomerular filtration rate decreases dramatically.  Once the kidneys no longer can do their job of filtering the blood, a person enters into end-stage, renal disease.  Because there are no overt symptoms of diabetic nephropathy. Regularly, screening. The urine of individuals with diabetes is super important.  Microalbuminuria, which means, excreting, 30, to 300 mg of albumin in a day, is a reliable signal. That diabetic nephropathy is started to set in  Excreting above 300 milligrams per day is considered mackerel albuminuria, and is a sure sign of a problem.  Unfortunately, diabetic nephropathy is a progressive complication that can be significantly, slow down, but not completely stopped.  Keeping tight control on hypertension in hyperglycemia is critical.  Specifically angiotensin-converting enzyme Inhibitors or ACE inhibitors as well as Angiotensin receptor. Blocker is can be particularly useful. These not only lower blood pressure as a whole but they also specifically reduce constriction of the efferent arteriole by reducing this constriction. We reduce the pressure within the glomerulus as well as the damage that comes from it.  All right, as a quick recap diabetic nephropathy is kidney damage that's caused by diabetes, which results in glomerular basement membrane, thickening, mesangial, expansion, and sclerosis.  An initial phase of increased glomerular, filtration rate is followed by Progressive albuminuria. Then a gradual decline in glomerular filtration rate and finally renal failure.  This progression can be slowed by tight control blood sugar and blood pressure and the use of ACE inhibitors or Angiotensin receptor. Blockers to decrease pressure specifically within the glomerulus.  Hey, everybody. My name is Kyle. I'm one of the team members here at osmosis. I do a little bit of everything for Content.

Superficial necrosis is unsightly and can lead to unattractive scarring. But otherwise does not affect the patient's likelihood of survival or physical capability to the same extent. However, massive my own crisis will likely result in the loss of movement of the entire region if the necrotic damage is allowed to continue.  Throughout an affected limb then often that entire limb is lost permanently. It is often difficult to identify the extent of muscle damage as C perfringens may be at work in deep a facial layers below the skin unlike other anaerobic infections discharge in these infections is often not purulent instead. The discharge is often described as sweetly putrid or dishwater pus because it is much thinner than normal. Puss. This is due to the lysis of neutrophils.

       " 'Lv4r-P6H7bU': \"All right. So our next topic is blood sugar and this is a really popular one with all the clients I talk to you. Because I feel like when I started in my practice 10 years ago, when I would talk to people about their blood pressure, they may or may not have known what it was and it was kind of like, oh my friend, over there, has diabetes. And now I feel like it's everybody knows somebody who's diabetic, you know, it's all over the place. So blood sugar is something that is really  Ali really concerning in most diets regardless of where you live. How old you are? Blood sugar's a big issue. Now, we do think about blood sugar when it comes to diabetes. And basically what happens is when you eat carbohydrates and sugar of any sort that goes through your digestive system, pretty quickly, and then once it hits your bloodstream, it acts like no other nutrient does proteins fat kind of take their time, getting into your bloodstream, but carbohydrates.  It immediately and you have that immediate rise in blood sugar. Then what happens is you get this signal sent to your pancreas and your pancreas releases insulin and insulin is a hormone. So it's released to takes all that blood sugar swooshes into your cells, where your cells, then use that blood sugar to do, the things they need to do to help, give you energy, help you focus when you're at work. All those things that we think of that carbohydrates actually do that, are good for us.  However, the problem is again. We get too much there. We have dice are way too high in sugar way too high in refined carbs. Therefore our pancreas just kind of gets tired and it's not able to produce as much insulin as it needs not able to keep up. And so what happens is that blood sugar is in stored as fat in the body and eventually your pancreas just starts not working as well as it should.  That's when somebody tends to go on insulin. That's when you get the diagnosis of diabetes. So it's really important to know what your blood sugar levels are kind of where you're at. And you know, I know that there's a lot of people out there and you start to feel like, well I can do this. I can live with diabetes and you can, but the goal would be to not go on medication with diabetes. That you can actually control it with your diet and exercise.  But you're probably going to get really tired of hearing me say that you could deal with things with diet and exercise but it's true. And you know, of course, there is the genetic factor and I'm going to talk about that next. But when you look at it, you really want to try to live a lifestyle that's going to allow you to not put all your money into maintaining your health when medication instead taking that money and putting it a place that is going to help. You be healthier. It's going to allow you to exercise. You can get  The access to exercise exercise, access to healthy food, supplements, that you need all those things, instead of putting all your money at the pharmacy. So again, blood sugar, very important thing, know your numbers when it comes to that and know that you can control it with diet and exercise.\",\n",
       " 'LvaVsnHbIbI': \"Hey guys, dr. Burke here in this short video. We're going to talk about hypoglycemia. What is that? That's a low blood sugar situation. The symptoms are irritable Ness. Sometimes you get bloodshot eyes or irritable or sand in the eyes that feels like it's an irritated or sensitive I situation but you're going to be craving carbs. Okay, you're not going to think correctly. You're going to be looking for sugar. What's happening is you have a rebound effect from  insulin being too powerful and it's the insulin is too much and it's creating a decrease in the blood sugar's normally it's between eighty and a hundred and then anytime you go lower than that. You create a situation where your hypoglycemic. Okay. Now the way it works is the pancreas makes insulin.  And it makes another hormone called glucagon. Okay. So this is a another new word. I want to help you understand glucagon is kind of like it works with insulin. It sort of works opposed. It works together not necessarily opposed to bring the sugars at a certain level. So glucagon what that does. It releases stored sugar in the liver to raise the sugar higher. Okay, so that way we can always have a balance of  If something's too high bring it down if it's too low it brings it up. So we have both of these hormones working together to keep your blood sugar's level. All right, but the real problem that creates this is too much insulin. It means you too much sugar. So what triggers insulin is sugar and refined carbohydrates and the body will go in there and take the sugar out and store it as fat or cholesterol. Okay, but what happens is that  that you have glucagon, which is also going to work in this triggered by protein. So that's why if you take a hypoglycemic and you give them protein they feel so much better. Why because you are triggering the release of sugar and it's going to raise the sugar and now all of a sudden the Cravings will go away. So that's one way to get rid of cravings for sweets. So, how do you correct hypoglycemia? Number one, you have to keep insulin low, okay.  Because it's too high and you have to avoid the sugar that's number one. You have to it's never you never going to heal it because usually when you have hypoglycemics what they're doing is they're giving in to the sugars or they're eating potatoes or they're having five meals a day, which is the biggest mistake because every time you eat you trigger insulin, okay, so you feel better, but you never correct the problem. So the insulin goes up and then it goes down and you have you can start getting diabetes.  He teased and it's just a nightmare. Okay. So the way to do it is to make sure that you're consuming protein with each meal. So we keep this sugar at the certain level. All right, and then we avoid the sugar protein avoiding sugar. But you also need some fat to be able to go longer. So you're not having five six meals a day with hypoglycemics. They can't last to the next meal before craving because the whole thing is damaged. So you have to add more fat too.  Longer so as to heal insulin because we want to not eat so frequent. Okay, so it's cut the sugar out. Make sure your protein with each meal. Don't eat too often add more fat to go longer. Okay, and what's going to happen is you will heal this whole system. I used to have this problem. It's completely hand. I can go all day without eating not a problem. So that's what hypoglycemia is and that's how you correct it it's not that hard and one last thing.  It's fascinating you take a diabetic and they give them insulin or they'll give them that foreman and they give them these sugar pills or glucose pills. They're synthetic sugar. And so they tell them if your sugar goes down too low to take the sugar pill to raise it up.  Why don't you just take less medication because the medications are lowering the sugar. Why would you take more sugar to raise it up so you can take medication. So that's the worst mistake. So if you have hypoglycemia, you don't want to consume fruit sugar, honey. Juice unless it goes really really really low and it's dangerous. But if it's coming down just a little bit it's much better off if you add a little protein. Okay, at least so that way you don't stimulate this and  Start adding more healthy food so you can get out of this situation. Alright, so those are some tips go ahead and apply those and make some comments below. I'll see you next video.\",\n",
       " 'LVgzOyHVcj4': \"Ship. But more than 50% were dissatisfied with their sex lives. We're having sex. Don't get me wrong. We're just having sex at the wrong time and with the wrong people. I'll get to that later.  We're having sex. Before we get married 10 years on average. So we are effectively in a long-term relationship and potentially quite sexually board before we even mess up the marital bed, and that has its consequences most Brides. Today, do not have sex on their wedding nights and 50% of men would not have married. Their spouse. Had they known their marriage was going?  To be sexless. So everybody wants to know, just how much sex are married people having, whether they are in, heterosexual, relationships, or same-sex, unions. You all want to know what's going on at the Joneses. Well, not much.  Only about seven percent of married, couples set. The sheets Ablaze most married couples have sex a little bit more than once a week for the first decade of their marriage. It decreases after that. So they have sex about 58 times a year and 20 percent of marriages meet the criteria as a sexless marriage and that defined by the experts is sex less than 10 times.  A year, so why aren't we having sex in our marriages? Well, there's a little known chemical in the brain conveniently called Peña or p and it's responsible for the Elation the excitement and the euphoria that you feel when you meet somebody that you are sexually interested in.  It's a fantastic feeling. This chemical is scourging through your blood vessels. You are so happy. That's how powerful this little chemical is. Well what happens after two years that chemical diminishes as does sexual frequency. That's just about the time you might get married or may have conflict in your relationship. And that is why communication is key to great sex. Now, there's another reason we're not  Having sex in our relationship and that has to do with the sex education that we provide. I'd like to share a story about myself. When I was a teenager. My mother came racing into my bedroom, and she said, Maureen, please tell me. You have not allowed a boy to french. Kiss you.  She was feeling terrible that this sex education. Came a bit late night. I was feeling horrific lie, guilty as an Irish Catholic girl that I'd french-kissed a number of boys by that stage. We teach girls and women that sex is dirty and sex is bad or it's overrated. We say you're just going to get a sexually transmitted infection anyway, or you might get pregnant. It's whole fear-based thing. Frightens women from enjoying sex and  Never talk about pleasure with girls and women or orgasm. And in fact, some women say orgasms not important and that the journey is just as good as the destination. I disagree.  Of course. I'm the one who french-kissed all the boys has an Irish, got the girl. It's like getting on a train with your lover and you are going to the most pleasurable place on the planet. You are so excited. You're getting lubed up with all the free drinks. They're giving you. This is amazing and just before you reach your destination.  He gets off and you don't.  You get my point.  Now, this sex education, we have four boys and men that's entirely different. It's a global program. It's free. It's accessible to everybody and it's known as Internet pornography. Fantastic. And it does nothing to teach men and boys about intimacy, which is really important to men and boys or how to make love to anybody.  Also, we have a paucity of information about sexual health for our lgbtqi community. And we need to add to that. Now, marriage can rapidly go from. Holy matrimony to holy, hell with the finances. The kids, the house has the illness. I mean, you may have signed up for sickness and health, but that was long before you'd ever witnessed a man cold.  and,  And how about that richer or poorer thing? Ladies? We're going to have to start going for richer. Most women today are working inside. And outside of the home. We're doing the Lion's Share of the housework, because according to research men, don't feel they're that good at it. And we're Bridging, the Gap between growing children in aging parents. We are exhausted doing it all and never doing it. And when we are doing it with,  Checking our smartphones, ten percent of people check their smartphones during sex.  35% immediately afterward.  We are connected to the internet. We are connected to the internet and disconnected from our would-be lovers. Maybe this is the reason that the most common sex position for married couples.  Is doggy style?  No, no, it's not what you're thinking, get your minds out of the gutter. This is the one where he's on all fours and begs. And she plays dead. I have a clinical practice where I see patients that have sexual dysfunction and there are two questions that I ask everybody. And the first one is, are you sexually active? It's obvious. And when I asked women,  They never say yes or no. Well, they never say yes, but they never say yes or no. They say sometimes sort of I'm not sure he is or they say I'm married. I say well that means no to me. They say yes, you're right. It is no most men complain that women never initiate sex.  The reason for this is because once again, the sex education, we provide two women, women falsely, believe that female sexual interest desire, proceed, sexual activity. When in actuality, it is sexual activity that prompts sexual interest and desire, sexual arousal, emerges as a result of sexual activity.  So you guys, I know intimacy is important to you. The most important question that reflects this that I receive from you is how much masturbation is too much masturbation?  So, I just say, well, as long as you can go to work, you should, you should be fine.  And then I realize that that's perhaps all that you're doing at work. So I know intimacy is important. You want to come home and you want to make love to your wife if you're in a heterosexual relationship. So after a long and quite possibly, very hard day, you come home to a bit of chaos, perhaps but you've just got sex on the mind.  And she says, did you remember the milk and you're like, darn the milk? I forgot the milk don't beat yourselves up about it. If not for the milk. We have Facebook hormones. I'm feeling a little tired tonight. I'm my stomach sticking out. I'm feeling kind of fat can't do it tonight. Didn't we have sex last month? And you're like? That was actually last year.  You don't get it. I mean literally you don't get it, but you're like, she's amazing. She's Works in and outside of the home. She does a great job with the kids. She volunteers. She even has time for girls nights out. So I brought a friend home after one such girls night out as we approached her house.  Drove up. She looked up to her bedroom window. Saw that the lights were on. And she said, uh, don, he's waiting up for me. Do me a favor drive around the block a few times, until the light goes out. I said, listen, you get in there and make love to your husband before somebody else does because that is one thing that will increase a woman's sexual desire when someone else wants her, man.  Still unconvinced. She said I decided to extol the health and beauty benefits that sex has for a woman.  A youthful glow. Better sleep. Wrinkle free skin. Keep driving. She said  There is a device that will increase anybody, sexual desire, and that happens to be the Mercedes-Benz 4matic convertible SL and it comes in 64 colors. But if that doesn't do it, the desire to have a baby, will rev up any woman sex drive. The problem is having that baby is likely to kill.\",\n",
       " 'LWDQyaKVols': \"Beta cells of the pancreas attic eyelids, start secreting, insulin insulin is a peptide hormone that binds to the insulin receptor and stimulates glucose uptake by our cells.  Now, under the influence of insulin liver and skeletal muscle store, absorb glucose in form of glycogen, many other cells quickly break down absorb glucose to make ATP a molecule which provides immediately available energy.  So, in summary, you can think of insulin as a key for entrance of glucose into cells, which either use it immediately for energy or store it in order to meet future demand. So, now, what happens, when blood glucose levels fall too low. Well, if that's the case of our cells of the pancreatic islets, release a different peptide, hormone, that is glucagon.  Glucagon simply has the opposite effect of insulin. So for example, when it acts on the liver, it causes breakdown of stored glycogen into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream.  So now let's switch gears and let's talk about drugs used for diabetes.  The first group of Agents, I would like to discuss is insulin and its analogs.  So human insulin can be reproduced by recombinant DNA technology using bacteria or Yeast. The amino acid sequence of human. Insulin can also be altered to produce insulin analogs with different onset and duration of action.  Now, because insulin is a polypeptide, it is susceptible to degradation in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, in order to be effective. It's typically administered by subcutaneous injection.  Insulin preparations are generally divided into three major categories based on how quickly and how long they work.  So first, we have rapid and short acting insulins preparations that fall into this category are in. So unless Pro insulin as part and Insulin glue icing, which are considered as rapid-acting producing Peak effect in as quickly as 30 minutes and duration of action of up to five hours.  Another analog that belongs to this group is regular insulin, which is considered as short-acting with Peak effect, as quick as two hours and duration of action usually less than 8 hours.  Now you may wonder what gives these analogues the ability to act quickly. Well, here's the thing. Insulin molecules naturally like to stick together forming so-called hexamers that is six insulin molecules bound together. These hexamers are too large to cross from the subcutaneous tissue into the bloodstream. Therefore, they must first separate into single insulin molecules before absorption can occur.  So now what the clever scientist did is they alter the amino acid sequence of insulin molecules to make them less likely to aggregate which resulted in analogs with faster absorption and more rapid action.  Next, we have intermediate acting insulin. Preparation that falls into this category is NPH insulin. Also known as ISO Fein insulin.  Unlike the rapid acting insulins NPH, insulin has a little slower onset of action. It produces Peak effect somewhere around six hour, mark and lasts about 18 hours.  These longer lasting effects are accomplished simply by addition of zinc and protamine to regular insulin, which results in a complex that is less. Soluble. The final outcome is delayed absorption and does longer duration of action.  Finally, we have long-acting insulins what slow onset of action. Preparations that fall into this category are the following insulin demure with a peak effect between six and eight hours and duration of action of up to 24 hours. Next insulin glargine, which doesn't produce Peak effect due to its steady delivery of insulin for about 24 hours.  And finally, we have insulin, the glutamate, which also doesn't produce Peak effect and lasts Beyond 24 hours.  And again, all these long lasting effects, are the result of modifications to the insulin molecule. In case of insulin demure, fatty acid side chain was added to the insulin molecule, which allows it to bind to albumin and the slow down its release into the bloodstream.  Insulin glargine. On the other hand was modified to have low. Solubility at Mutual pH, which causes it to form, precipitate in the subcutaneous tissue that slowly releases insulin into the bloodstream, lastly, insulin. The glow deck was designed to form long chains of hexamers in subcutaneous tissue that serve as a Depot from which insulin is continuously and slowly released.  Now, when it comes to side effects, not surprisingly hypoglycemia, or low, blood glucose is the most common one associated, with the use of insulin. Another adverse effect is lipodystrophy which can develop at the site of repeated insulin injections.  Now, let's move away from the insolence and let's talk about different type of injectable analog using treatment of diabetes that is synthetic emmalin. So first of all, what is emmalin what pancreatic beta cells not only secrete insulin, but also another peptide hormone called emmalin emmalin's job is to delay, gastric emptying to suppress postprandial glucose on secretion and to promote satiety.  Yummy emmalin mimetic that's currently available on the market is prevalent type. One of the biggest benefits of Kremlin tide is that it allows insulin doses to be reduced.  However, the risk of hypoglycemia is still there. Other common side effects associated with Kremlin type are nausea and modest weight loss.  Now, let's move on to the last group of injectable analogues. That is incorrect and Mathematics.  So first off what are in credits? Well in credits are a group of metabolic hormones that are secreted from the god in response to food ingestion and their job is to stimulate pancreas to produce more insulin. The two primary. Incredible hormones are glucagon-like peptide. One glp-1 for short and glucose dependent insulin, or Tropic polypeptide, Gip for short.  So in theory increasing concentrations of these hormones would benefit patients with diabetes. However, as it turns out, their actions are actually quite limited as a result of Rapid inactivation by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp-4 for short.  To solve this problem, scientists were able to develop GOP. One memetics that are resistant to degradation by dpp-4 enzyme. Example, of agents that belong to this class are exactly tight. And liraglutide, in addition, to stimulating insulin secretion GOP, one mimetic slow, gastric emptying and promote satiety.  As a result patients using this agents often experience weight loss, some common side effects. Also include GI problems such as nausea. Vomiting diarrhea, and constipation.  Lastly, there have been some reports suggesting increased risk of pancreatitis associated with the use of glp-1 mimetics. This is thought to be due to their proliferate of effects on pancreas.  Now, let's switch gears and let's talk about oral anti-diabetic agents. So first I would like to discuss a class of drugs closely related to glp-1 memetics namely dpp-4 Inhibitors. So, another way to enhance the effects of in credit hormones is to Simply inhibit dpp-4 enzyme which is responsible for the inactivation of glp-1 and Gip by promoting the activity of glp-1 and Gip hormones. We increase insulin secretion.  Decrease gastric, emptying and reduce glucagon release.  Drugs that belong to this class include a log leptin, linagliptin saxagliptin and sittig Lipton side effects of dpp-4 Inhibitors are similar to those of glp-1 memetics with the most commonly reported being nasopharyngitis and headache.  Now, let's move on to another class of oral anti-diabetic agents. That is to follow Yuri has. So in order to understand how sulfonylureas work, first. We need to review the mechanism of glucose depend on insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. So available glucose enters beta cell, through glucose transporter to abbreviated as GL U T2, once inside the cell glucose, gets metabolized to create a bunch of ATP.  Next, the rising levels of ATP lead to inhibition of ATP sensitive potassium channels. Thus, blocking the inflow of potassium, this in turn leads to depolarization of the cell's membrane, which triggers activation of voltage-gated, calcium channels, and then influx of calcium.  Finally increased levels of calcium mediate Fusion of insulin containing, vesicles with the membrane leading to insulin release.  So now, what's the final Yuri has do is they bind to and inhibit the activity of ATP sensitive potassium channels.  This just like in common glucose triggers membrane depolarization calcium, influx and ultimately insulin secretion.  Other actions of sulfonylureas include increased sensitivity of beta cells to glucose, and reduce hepatic glucose production.  Example of drugs that belong to this class are glimepiride Glyburide and Glipizide.  Some of the common side effects reported with sulfonylureas are hypoglycemia and weight gain.  Lastly because so far you areas are highly protein bound and most are extensively metabolized in the liver by cytochrome p450 enzymes. They tend to interact with wide variety of other drugs.  Now let's move on to another class of oral anti-diabetic agents. That is Glenn eyes. So just like so funnel. Yuri has the Golan Heights. Also stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic.\",\n",
       " 'LylsVQ8HFIw': \"Is barely raise blood glucose at all. In 1981 Jenkins and co-workers, published a landmark article in the American journal of clinical nutrition in which they proposed a new indicator that was able to measure the speed at, which are sugars, containing a specific food and raise blood glucose, and they call this indicator. Glycemic index. Propelled by numerous findings about the detrimental effects of repeated, and elevated blood glucose and Insulin Peaks.  And their risk for fat accumulation of obesity diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The concept of glycemic index soon became very popular. The higher the glycemic index of a food. The faster its carbs enter the bloodstream and raise blood glucose causing the pancreas to release insulin. You may wonder how this index is calculated in a few words. Here's how you take a solution of 50 grams of glucose in water, and you give it to a group of individuals. Now, for the next to her.  Course, you draw a drop of blood by finger punter at regular intervals and you measure blood glucose concentrations in this example. You see that blood glucose Peaks between 30 minutes and 1 hour. And after 2 hours is almost back to Baseline. If you measure the area below this curve, you know, it's proportional to the amount of glucose that was in the bloodstream during these two hours. Then you take the same subjects and you have them eat a test food. So your bowl of lentils in such.  An amount that the quantity of carbs, they contain is still 50 grams. Let me stress. This again. You're not giving them 50 grams of lentils, but a serving of Lancaster provides 50 grams of carbs. Now, you do the same measurement. And in this example, you see that the peak is about, at the same time, but it's much lower and it doesn't decline as fast. Of course, different people respond in different ways, but this doesn't matter because you can use the first measurement to standardize the result. So you calculate the area under the Curve.  For ears and Tails, and you divide it by the area, you obtained, for the solution of glucose times 100 to get rid of the decimals. And there you have your glycemic index of lentils. If you have worked. Well, you will get very similar numbers in all your different subjects to complicate things. Some Labs have chosen not to use glucose in water as a standard but white bread. This has advantages and disadvantages who's discussion goes beyond the scope of our course, just keep in mind that you can  Not compare GI numbers from different tables, if they are calculated using different standards, the numbers, I will show you here are all calculated using glucose as a standard. The concept of glycemic index is often misunderstood. So let me clarify a very important point. The glycemic index is a measure of the speed at which the carbs in a food, raise blood glucose levels. It is not a measure of the extent of this effect.  Because the glycemic index is an independent of the amount of carb contain in a food, think of a man target shooting with a gun. The glycemic index would tell us how fast it shoots his bullets, but it does not tell us how many bullets he has to shoot. If he only has a few bullets, he can shoot them as fast as he wants, but it will still not be very deadly. So the glycemic index, only makes sense, if we consider it together with another piece of information, which is the amount of  Of carbs contained in that food for example, carrots ever relatively high glycemic index, but they also have very little sugar. This means there are sugar enters the bloodstream fast, but because it's very small amount. The overall effect of carrots on blood glucose and Insulin release is minimum conversely. The glycemic index of potatoes is lower than that of carrots, but what an average carrot has about 4 grams of carbs and a potato has about 25 grams. So even if this  Herbs are absorbed more slowly. They still have a significant effect on blood glucose and Insulin because there are a lot to take into account, both the glycemic index and the total amount of carbs, a group of researchers from Harvard University proposing 1997, the concept of glycemic load. It is very simple. It's just a glycemic index of a food times the amount of digestible carbs contained in a standard serving of that food divided by 100.  Just to get rid of some zeros. This way. You have an index that considers both factors. If a food has a low GI but a lot of sugars. It's glycemic load will still be high conversely. If it has a high glycemic index, but very few sugars is glycemic load will still be relatively low. Let's go back to our previous example, and let's consider a glycemic index of 72 for carrots and of 63 for boiled potatoes, the glycemic load your character.  Be 72 times 4 grams of carbs. / 103, the glycemic load of our potato will be 63 times. 25 grams of carbs, / 164, the glycemic load of our potato is more than fivefold, the glycemic load of or carrot, even though it's glycemic index, its lower. Watermelon also has a high glycemic index of 72, but a slice of 120 grams only has 6 grams of sugar. So  It's glycemic load is for a banana of the same weight. Has a much lower glycemic index 52, but it has 20 grams of carbs. So it's glycemic load is Levin almost three times that of watermelon, of course, the glycemic load is one big disadvantage compared to the glycemic index. The glycemic index is always the same independent of the amount of food. The glycemic load is always based on a specific amount of food if I eat three, slices of  Melon, the glycemic load would be three times higher. When the glycemic index would still be 72. Take this coke is glycemic index is 58 a small. 100 ml glass 330ml, scan or a large six hundred meals fast food cup. All have a glycemic index of 58 to the small glass has 11 grams of sugar with a glycemic load of 6.4. The can is 37 grams of sugar, glycemic, load 21.5.  And the large cup, 67, g of sugar, and a glycemic load of 38.9. And by the way, 266 calories, the composition of a food is of course. The first determinant of its glycemic index. In particular, two key factors are the type of carbs and the presence of other nutrients. As far as simple sugars are concerned glucose raises. The glycemic index much more than fructose sucrose is in between since it makes it  To, as for complex carbs, the more branched starchy's, the lower the glycemic index because it will take longer to break it down. As for other nutrients, the presence of fiber proteins and lipids slows down, gastric emptying and intestinal absorption of glucose. Thus, lowering the glycemic index of a food. It is easy to understand why whole grains and their derivative products and lower glycemic indexes than the refined counterparts, but many other factors,  Erza fact, the glycemic index of a food including preparation processing and cooking. Let's consider our potato again. If we snack on it raw, it's glycemic index will be close to 0 because the starch of raw potato is almost entirely on the jazz festival. So it will travel intact through our small intestine without absorption. If we boil that potato, its glycemic index will quickly raised to about 60 because starch gelatinizes with heat and because  Easily digestible. If however, we eat that same potato. We need skin. Its fiber will slow down glucose digestion and absorption. And as a result its GI will be lower conversely. If we turn that potato into a mashed potato, its GI will further raise because starch becomes even more accessible to our digestive enzymes, which will convert it to Google's even faster. Finally. If we don't eat our Play-Doh at all, and just leave it there at room temp.  Within a few hours, it starts will start retrogradation becoming less and less the adjustable. And it's GI will progressively decrease together with the desirability of our potato, which will become less, and less soft and buttery the degree of cooking always matters if raw pasta has a glycemic index goes to 0, Al Dente pasta the way we Italians. Like it, still somewhat firm has a GI of about 50 because part of its starch is still harder to digest.  Is the overcooked pasta to the point. It becomes soft that you somehow appeared. Like has a GI about ten points higher because it's starch turns to glucose, much faster, some technological processes. Also fragment storage, raising GI such as Extrusion to make potato chips, or corn flakes, or pressure steaming to make puffed. Rice. As far as fruit is concerned, the degree of ripeness influences, the GI as the fruit, right?  Opens. It acids are converted to sugars. The texture become softer, and the GI tends to increase an overripe banana will have a higher glycemic index that one, that's still green. And then of course, peeing, fruits, and veggies always raises the GI because you remove a lot of fiber whenever we cut blend Puri, or in any way turning food into smaller pieces, the work of digestive enzymes is easier and glucose absorption is faster. So the GI increases  If you turn your bowl of lentils into a lentil puree, it's GI will be higher. If you juice a carrot, carrot juice will have a much higher GI than the whole care. And so, on so far, we have talked about individual foods, but it is important to remember that most of the time. We combine different foods in a meal. When we do that, these Foods mix in our stomach and get digested and absorbed together. So what really matters in the end, it's not the glycemic index or  The glycemic load of individuals food items but the overall glycemic load of the whole meal. Let's suppose we are mashed potatoes together with two slices of white bread and a can of Coke or let's imagine eating the same mashed potato. We just one slice of whole wheat bread with turkey and salad and a can of Diet Coke. What do you think would become of the glycemic load of the whole meal in the first scenario? We have combined a high glycemic.  I see.\",\n",
       " '1DOnLhVuX4': \"After you've had a myocardial infarct a heart attack, you are prone to developing complications. And the complication in this sort of context is essentially another disease or condition that crops up as a result of your myocardial infarct and most complications tend to occur within the first few weeks after having a heart attack.  So, let's look at some of the major complications that can occur after after myocardial infarct. And let's sort of do this in a stepwise fashion to make everything sort of flow logically in our heads. So, we can say that myocardial infarcts cause three major problems with our hearts, right? So, so one of the things is they cause our heart to have decreased contractility because after a heart attack, you've sustained some damage right to your to your heart muscle. So it can't always contract. Very well. You also get this  Will instability in your heart because all of the ions that sort of move back and forth across your heart muscle cell, membranes to maintain your electrical gradient. So your heart beats properly, they all get really disrupted. So you have this electrical instability and you also get tissue necrosis, right? You get death of some of your heart muscle cells.  So these three sort of effects of having a myocardial infarct. They really underlie all of the downstream complications that are possibly going to crop up. So how does reduce contractility do that? Well, if your heart's not Contracting properly, then you're not going to effectively be able to push blood out of your left ventricle to the rest of your body. Right? So you'll end up in a state called hypotension and hypotension just means that you have pathologically low blood pressure and when you have pathologically low blood pressure.  Not going to be able to fill your coronary arteries with with enough blood, all the blood that they need. Remember besides the coronary artery that's been blocked to result in your myocardial infarct. There are still other coronary vessels that need to have a healthy supply of blood coming to them so that they can in turn Supply blood to the rest of your heart muscle, right? The the heart muscle that isn't infarcted. So if they're not getting enough blood, then you'll start to get ischemia in the muscle and other parts of your heart. And if you get ischemia and other parts of your heart, then that'll  Cause more of your heart muscle all over to not contract properly and eventually you might not be able to maintain your cardiac output at all and end up in a condition called cardiogenic shock. And because this wall here and N were assuming that it's this wall that's been sort of injured in the, in the heart attack. Because this wall here isn't Contracting very well, you'd be predisposed to forming a thrombus, a clot on the inside of that left ventricle there. Because when blood isn't constantly moved around as it might not be in that,  Little area there, it tends to clot. And why is that bad? Well, sometimes they can sort of flick off become separated off of the left ventricle wall there, and travel through the aorta and into other vessels of the body where they might get stuck, and cause an infarction in another part of the body. For example, if one went up into your brain, it might get stuck in one of your your cerebral vessels and cause a stroke. So embolism is a potential problem. Embolism is the mobilization of a thrombus a clot.  All right. What about this electrical instability over here? Well, the electrical instability can cause arrhythmias, which is when your heart doesn't beat with a normal regular rhythm, like, it's supposed to. And again, that's due to a combination of things that's due to sort of disorganized ion movement within the cardiomyocytes. And it could also be due to a disrupted electrical conduction system within the heart. And, and I should mention as part of this conduction system compromise.  Asian here, the two major pacemaker centers in your heart are located in your right atrium. So you got your sinoatrial node about there and you have your atrioventricular node around here and these two nodes are really responsible for regulating the normal rhythm of your heart. And so, if you happen to have a myocardial infarct that affected the right atrium, where both these nodes live? You would probably end up developing an arrhythmia because you'd potentially knock out.  The two biggest Regulators of your heartbeat, your heart rate and Rhythm. All right, what about this tissue necrosis thing? Well, remember necrosis, just refers to death of something. So in this case, death of the heart tissue, well, remember, after a myocardial infarct, you get a whole bunch of immune cells that come into your heart and try to sort of Tidy things up after your heart attack. And when your immune cells are involved with sort of tidying, something up, that's called an inflammatory reaction.  And you might start to get this inflammation around the outside of your heart. I'm drawing this inflammation in as pink Here. Pink is supposed to represent all those white blood cells as part of your immune system mediating. This inflammatory response here on the outside of your heart. Now, remember your heart sort of sits inside this fibrous sack, it's encased by this fibrous, sort of cover called your pericardium, your pericardium. Perry, meaning around and cardio. I'm referring to your heart. And when you get all this,  Inflammatory sort of stuff happening on just beneath the pericardium on the outside of the heart. You could irritate your pericardium and you could end up with a condition called pericarditis. Now, that's not all that, tissue necrosis can do, it can do some other pretty nasty stuff here. So let's say that you start to get necrosis of your your septum here. The wall that separates your left ventricle in your right ventricle. Well, you can probably imagine that that wouldn't be very good at all your oxygenated blood.  Your left side of your heart and your deoxygenated blood in your right side of your heart, they would mix. And you would probably end up with a pretty significant hypoxemia or low oxygen level in your blood. A ventricular septal defect, would also cause some damage to the arteries in your lungs. Because if you can imagine blood from this high pressure system, on the left side of your heart, would sort of cross through this defect over to the right side of your heart and be pushed up through into your pulmonary circulation.  That's not good for your pulmonary circulation and can actually cause some pretty pretty big damage there. What else will tissue necrosis do? Well, what if you get that necrosis over on this side or really any other muscle that forms the outer outer wall of the heart. Well, where do you think blood in the heart? Would go off all of a sudden there was no wall anymore. It would just burst out of the heart. So tissue necrosis can also cause a rupture of The ventricle. But remember this pericardium we talked about this really tough.  Fibrous Sac that encases the heart, the blood would then just get trapped inside the pericardium, and it would start to sort of build up in the pericardium and track along the, the outer heart muscle and the and the inside of the pericardium. So that obviously would put a stress on the heart and prevent it from beating as well. And you'd end up with a complication called cardiac tamponade.  Tissue necrosis is not done yet though. One of the more common issues that happens as a result of tissue necrosis. Is this here? You've got these muscles in the bottoms of your ventricles called your papilla re muscles and what your papillae muscles do is they sort of hold onto the the cusps of your valves, the flaps of your valves using these structures called chordae, tendineae. They're these sort of tough durable string like things and so the papillary muscles in the core.  Ten and a work together to make sure that during a heartbeat. When your ventricles contract, your mitral valve in your tricuspid valve over on the right side. You have a set of papillary muscles and chordae tendineae over there as well. They make sure that the the cusps of your valves don't invert up into the Atria. And so sometimes after a heart attack one or more of these papillae muscles will become Nick roast. It'll die off. And when it dies off, all of a sudden. Now, the valve flap that it was holding onto can invert. It can  go up into the left atrium. This means that when The ventricle contracts to push blood out into the aorta to get around the body, blood can now, get back up into the left atrium. This is called having a leaky valve or a regurgitant valve. In this case, since it's the mitral valve, we call this mitral regurgitation. So just before we finish up, let me just draw your attention to this. If your heart has decreased contractility, then it's going to have to work harder to maintain proper perfusion of your body with blood.  If you have a mitral regurgitation then again your hearts going to have to work a lot harder to maintain proper perfusion of your body with blood. If you have a ventricular septal defect again, your heart is going to have to start working a lot harder. So these three conditions in particular if you develop any of these after a heart attack or not, you run the risk of developing congestive, heart failure, which is when your heart just can't pump out enough blood to meet the oxygen needs of your body.\",\n",

You're wasting your time and effort knowing if your blood sugar is too high or too low or just, right? Is vital in treating.  Diabetes. Now, you were diagnosed with pre-diabetes because of these numbers, you were diagnosed with pre-diabetes because of these numbers. Your fasting blood glucose level was between 100 and 125 on two separate readings.

       " '9SntRZe8': \"Chronic pancreatitis is persistent. Chronic inflammation of the pancreas often due to repeated bouts of acute pancreatitis.  While a history of acute pancreatitis, might lead to chronic pancreatitis. These diseases have distinct histo pathologies.  Acute pancreatitis is inflammation caused by destruction of the pancreas by its own digestive enzymes. A process called Auto digestion and is generally reversible. Chronic pancreatitis is inflammation due to irreversible changes to the pancreatic structure like fibrosis, atrophy and calcification.  The pancreas is a long skinny gland, the length of a dollar bill and is located in the upper abdomen, or the epigastric region behind the stomach.  It plays endocrine roles, for example, Alpha and beta cells, make hormones, like insulin and glucagon that are secreted into the blood stream. But it also plays exocrine roles. For example, acinar cells, make digestive enzymes that are secreted into the duodenum to help digest food.  These pancreatic digestive enzymes break down macromolecules, like carbohydrates lipids and proteins found in food, but these macromolecules are also found in the cells of the pancreas.  To protect the pancreas. The acinar cells manufacture inactive form to the enzymes called Pro enzymes or zymogens. These zymogens are normally activated by proteases which cleave off a polypeptide chain, which is kind of like pulling the pin out of a grenade for additional security. The zymogens are kept away from sensitive tissues in storage. Vesicles called zymogen, granules and are packaged with protease Inhibitors that prevent enzymes from doing damage if they become prematurely.  To digest a meal. These images are released into the pancreatic duct and delivered to the small intestine where they're activated by the protease trypsin.  Trypsin is a pancreatic digestive enzyme, that's produced as the zymogen trypsinogen.  Normally trypsinogen isn't activated until it's cleaved by protease in Taro peptidase, which is found in the duodenum.  But if trypsinogen and these zymogens become activated too early, then it can cause acute pancreatitis.  This might happen as a result of any injury to the acinar cells, or anything that prevents the normal secretion of the pro enzymes into the duodenum. The two leading causes of acute pancreatitis are alcohol abuse in gallstones.  With alcohol, abuse, it goes like this. Alcohol increases zymogen secretion from acinar cells. While decreasing fluid and bicarbonate production from the ductal epithelial cells as a result of pancreatic juice has become really thick and viscous potentially forming a plug that can block the duct. A blocked, duct is bad news because pancreatic juices start backing up increasing the pressure and leading to distension of the duct itself.  At the cellular level. One consequence of this. Is that membrane trafficking becomes chaotic. Zymogen, granules might fuse with lysosomes which brings trypsinogen into contact with lysosomal digestive enzymes.  Trypsinogen might then be turned into activated trypsin which Begins the Cascade of digestive enzyme activation and auto digestion of the pancreas, which is acute pancreatitis.  Alcohol. Also contributes a pancreatitis. In other ways though, for example, stimulating acinar cells to release inflammatory cytokines, which attracts a strong immune reaction neutrophils arrive quickly to the scene and often release, superoxide another proteases, which contribute to the problem.  Finally, it's not that high consumption and subsequent oxidative metabolism of alcohol. Might produce enough reactive, oxygen species to overwhelm cellular defenses in damage. The cells, in addition to alcohol, abuse other known causes of acute pancreatitis that frequently turn into chronic pancreatitis include tumors trauma to the pancreas and cystic fibrosis.  In fact, the term cystic fibrosis refers to the pancreatic cysts and fibrosis that develop in patients with mutations. In the cftr gene that Gene encodes for an ion transporter and mutations in that transporter cause the pancreatic secretions to become thick and sticky leading to obstruction of the ducts.  Importantly, cystic fibrosis is the main cause of chronic pancreatitis in children.  Repeated bouts of acute pancreatitis can progress to chronic pancreatitis with each bout there's potential for ductile dilatation and damage to the pancreatic tissue. As part of the subsequent healing process, pancreatic stellate cells, lay down fibrotic tissue, which causes narrowing or stenosis of the ducts as well as Aston our cell. Atrophy, in addition in certain conditions, like alcoholic acute pancreatitis calcium. Deposits of various sizes can accumulate on the plugs that form the  What's this gradual process of healthy, pancreatic tissue getting replaced by misshapen, ducts fibrosis, and calcium deposits is chronic pancreatitis.  Early diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis is challenging people with chronic pancreatitis often have continuous or intense intermittent abdominal pain in the epigastric region that sometimes radiates to the back. This pain may or may not be linked to eating meals and it tends to last for at least several hours, even though elevated lipase and amylase levels are suggestive of acute pancreatitis in chronic pancreatitis. There may not be enough healthy pancreatic tissue to make those enzymes.  So they may or may not be elevated.  Oftentimes the diagnosis relies on Imaging studies, that can identify the structural changes to the pancreas, for example, abdominal X-rays and CT scans might show calcification of the pancreas. The pancreatic ducts themselves can be visualized with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or ercp, which is a technique where an endoscope is passed down through the mouth to the duodenum or it's used to deliver contrast medium to the pancreatic ducts.  Subsequent fluoroscopy contrast studies can reveal structural changes to the pancreatic ductal system. For example, the duck might take on a Chain of Lakes pattern due to alternating stenosis in dilation of the Ducks.  An alternative technique that can also evaluate the pancreatic ductal systems is magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or MRCP.  As the acinar cells become impaired, they produce fewer. Pancreatic digestive enzymes, which results in pancreatic insufficiency. These individuals can have trouble absorbing foods and dietary fats, often lose weight and even develop a deficiency in vitamins. A d and K, which are fat soluble vitamins. Without digestive enzymes, fat might pass right through the intestines, undigested leading to greasy and smelly stools called steatorrhea.  A long-term consequence of chronic pancreatitis is the development of diabetes mellitus, which happens as the recurrent inflammation. Begins to damage the alpha and beta cells of the pancreas.  In addition, some individuals develop pancreatic pseudocyst, which in the context of chronic pancreatitis is often the result of ductile obstruction, which increases pressure, induces, leakage and results in accumulation of para, pancreatic fluid. In fibrous granulation tissue, either within, or just outside the pancreas.  Not surprisingly repeated inflammation, can also give rise to pancreatic cancer on rare occasions?  Treatment of chronic pancreatitis involves controlling pain in trying to control the risk factors things, like drinking less alcohol, eating less meat and reducing obesity individuals. With pancreatic insufficiency might require replacement, digestive, enzymes, and nutritional supplements. And those with diabetes might need insulin replacement therapy.  All right, as a quick recap chronic pancreatitis happens when irreversible changes to the pancreatic structure like fibrosis. Atrophy and calcification. Begin to decrease the functions of the organ. Eventually this leads to pancreatic insufficiency, which makes it difficult to digest food, as well as the destruction of Alpha and beta cells, which makes it difficult to produce hormones, like insulin.

       " 'MFmjLloYN7A': \"Hey guys, dr. Burke here in this video. We're going to talk about insulin resistance, potassium and blood pressure out of all the nutrients that you need potassium is something needed in very large quantities. You need forty seven hundred milligrams of potassium every single day. Now, what does that mean with food? It means that hardly anyone is getting their potassium because you would need 7 to 10 cups of vegetables every single day. Okay. So, how many cups of vegetables do you consume in a given day?  Or maybe five maybe less but I buy do it, because I feel so much different. But here's the thing. We need four times as much potassium as we do sodium. Okay, most people consume four times as much sodium as they do potassium. They have a lot of fluid retention. So they both work together in relationship to fluids and hydration, but we need in fact, if you look at vegetable content,  It's always heavy on the potassium and very low in the sodium. Okay, but if you're doing like chips and salty things that's going to, that's going to throw this whole thing off. So what happens when you have low potassium is, you get high blood pressure, potassium is a physiological relaxer. It calms the nervous system. It actually softens the arteries. It actually can prevent Strokes. It's very, very healthy, healthy mineral and so it can also prevent constipation. It also can prevent.  Leg cramps, so it's involved in nerve conductivity and muscle contraction and relaxation. So, with a problem with potassium, you can have a lot of cramps tightness and tension in your body. And you can also have a lot of electrical problems with your heart arrhythmias atrial fib. That's all potassium deficiency because people don't consume enough. So, let's pretend that you're, you have high blood pressure and you have to take a diuretic thiazide.  Well what that does is it gets rid of fluid. Well, it does it also gets rid of potassium. So what happens when you take this diuretic to fix your high blood pressure, you lose more potassium, raising the blood pressure more. So now you need another medication and then you're told to drink more water, which dilutes the electrolytes more. Especially potassium and your blood pressure goes higher because more water is not going to hydrate you. It's going to get  Rid of the electrolytes that you have potassium, specifically, and you don't get the hydration. You once had so, the whole myth of drinking more water to hydrate, you is not quite true. You need the minerals that specifically potassium. That's the one you need in the most not like even magnesium. You need about four hundred and twenty milligrams, potassium, eating, 4700.  Okay. Now also if your salt sensitive, okay, especially if your blood pressure. What that really means is your potassium deficient the way to fix people that are salt, sensitive is just increased potassium and they'll do fine. So, instead of restricting salt, why don't we just increase potassium? It's a better strategy because if you need potassium for other things, 98% of all the potassium in your body is inside the cell. Not out.  Side the cell. So when you get test tested from your blood or whatever testing you do, it's very difficult to test a potassium deficiency because it's all inside the cell. And so you might, you might think you have normal levels that you really don't because you never did it intracellular test for potassium. Okay. The other interesting thing about potassium is it takes insulin to control and absorb potassium.  If you don't have enough insulin, you can't pull potassium in the cells. So insulin regulates potassium. Now, how does that relate to a pre-diabetic? Someone has insulin resistance or a diabetic? Well, if they have insulin resistance, they're going to have the cells are going to block insulin. So guess what's going to happen to the potassium? They're not going to have enough potassium.  So, a lot of times when you have a pre-diabetic or like, even a diabetic State, they have a huge, huge deficiency of potassium. And one of the things, I make sure that they do is greatly increase the vegetable content to increase the potassium to help balance this thing out. Because you're going to have, you're going to have so many side effects from that. So if you actually add more potassium you can decrease the need for insulin. So that's a really cool.  Relationship. I just wanted to touch on the relationship between these two, these three items right here. And if you have blood pressure, start increasing your vegetables. And if you like this kind of information, if you like learning about nutrition, if you find it interesting, I have a health coaching training program that you might be interested in learning about where we teach you a lot more about nutrition and how the body works.

       " 'MhCIrN9JFqU': \"Tornado or a whole series of them that plowed through Dallas and rather disrupted, the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport for quite a few days. So we were very pleased at despite that particular unfortunate occurrence Melanie was willing to reschedule and come back and speak to us today, May 30th. We arranged a thunderstorm last night which delayed her plane from Landing for two hours. So yes, the tradition continues. Hopefully the flight home will be uneventful.  Oh, dr. Cobb obtained, her undergraduate degree at the University of Chicago. Her PhD in biological chemistry, at washu, after postdoctoral training at Mount Sinai and a three-year period. As a research associate at Albert. Einstein, she landed a faculty position at UT Southwestern and has essentially been there since that time for most of the remarkable career that she has carried out while studying a variety of issues, but particularly  Known for her work on map. Kinase has at UT Southwestern. She for a time was to have Iraq dean of the southwestern graduate school. And now, as I've mentioned, is professor and holder of an endowed chair for all of us who have struggled a trying to understand map kinases and map, kinase kinase has and map kinase kinase kinase has. And I don't know how many cases were up to now, it's always a relief to have somebody come and explain this stuff and not only  Do we have a distinguished speaker member of the National Academy to lead us through this? But she has made seminal contributions to this whole field, particularly in the original identification of erk1 and erk2 and many other steps that have followed. Now, being applied, as she will tell us about today, in terms of their function, in the pancreatic beta cell with obvious, implications for diabetes, a disease, of course, which is in Virtual epidemic proportions right now in our country and increasingly. So in the  To the world. So, it is a great pleasure to have her here today. Please join me in welcoming Professor Melanie cop.  Thank you very much for the introduction. And thank you for inviting me twice and I'm glad I actually made it one of those times. Let's see.  Okay, so just briefly today. I'm going to tell all stories really about pancreatic beta cells after a little bit of Bank background on erk1 and 2. Okay. So I think it's become increasingly clear that our went into or involved in all kinds of processes and cells. And in fact, I can think of few events that don't have some input from these particular map kinase has their key and proliferation and so lineage.  Seventh and maintenance of differentiated functions. And that's what I'm most interested in and why we've looked a lot at pancreatic beta cells. There, miss regulated in all kinds of disease, syndromes, particularly cancer, due to activation of Upstream activators of the pathway by mutation in a number of cancers. There are a whole range of Developmental syndromes that end up impacting a the activity state of erk1 and 2. Some of these are among the most common developmental syndromes and  People. And there are also negative Regulators of tyrosine. Kinase signaling that are involved in causing Burke impacted developmental issues. So, a number of years ago through collaborations with Betsy Goldsmith, and one of her, postdocs and students, who might be here as a fellow. We solve the crystal structures of work to and the unphosphorylated state here.  In the phosphorylated. State looks like a typical protein kinase. One of the nice things about it is, it's a relatively small protein, so we could see the whole protein. It's about 41, KV ins, and it has two domains, a smaller n-terminal domain, and a larger c-terminal, domain, and ATP binds here at the interior of the interface, between the domains. It's activated by to phosphorylations. And in the case of her to that activation is really profound causing about a fifty thousand fold increase in kcap.  And the two phosphorylations are in this activation Loop region here and they caused structural rearrangements in the protein to cause this activity increase a couple of points. I'll come back to later a little bit about the map. Kinase insert. These purple regions are regions that are not contained in the core kinase domain there, inserts and map kinases in particular. This insert here and winding up the back of the protein. We have a c terminal region that has an important.  Um, 310 Helix here, and he looks at the top of the molecule.  In terms of detection of activity, while we used for many years, immune complex, kinase assays. Now, just about everybody uses antibodies to the phosphorylated forms of work, one and two, a couple of reasons. Those are so good one is that the two phosphorylation sites are only separated by a single residue? And the second reason or these are really rather abundant proteins as we think of signaling protein. Sometimes is perhaps somewhat rare, but these may be on the order of a couple of hundred an animal or even,  Micromolar, perhaps in certain cells. So there's a lot of them. So they're easy to measure to detect and so I'm going to talk about this pathway and I just for the sake of full disclosure want to point out that Kirk to fits here in this example of a signaling Network and it's very easy to focus on one little pathway and lose sight of the big picture which is all of these interconnections. And so more and more. We're trying to acknowledge these interconnections and figure out how they relate.  Contribute to what else happens when this pathway is, is turned on. Okay, so much of what I'm going to say, will focus on specificity in different ways. And the first thing I want to point out is although this Cascade can be activated by all kinds of ligands almost every single agent that affects cell function will change the activity of erk1 and 2. There is one step where incredible specificity is generated in map. Kinase Pathways and I have  Three Pathways here. This is the map kinase step. And just to clarify. This is the map to kinase step or map KK. And is it is at this step that we have incredible specificity. And this just shows here, phosphorylation and activation of, in this case phosphorylation of erk2 by a Mexican in its path way the map to case compared to the map to Kay's in the P-38 pathway. And you can see there's more or less.  Loot specificity different. So while lots of things turn on this pathway, they have to work through this particular Cascade to do it.  So I mentioned that many agents control this pathway can change its activity, almost a dizzying number and it's sometimes hard to get a grip on how different activating mechanisms can lead to different outputs. And what you can see here is old data about 20 years old, from a whole bunch of different Laboratories who've worked on this problem. Activation of erk1 and 2 and pc-12 cells by two different ligands EGF, which gives a very  Rapid increase in activity, that's extremely transient, and ngf nerve growth factor, which causes prolonged activation that can even be detected the next day. And so the differences in ligand activation mechanism has a big impact on the output of the pathway. So it's this pathway is associated primarily with proliferation of pc-12 cells and ngf with neurotic extension, in peace. We see pc-12 cells. So phosphatases have  Implicated as at least one mechanism for controlling this type of ligand dependent kinetic specificity, and this will come up again when we get to beta cells in just a minute. So another important factor in determining what these enzymes do, they can be activated by a number of ligands, but they don't always localized an active form at the same place and I'll show a couple more slides about that. But first, I want to point out. There are a large number of six, scaffolding proteins that direct these  Enzymes localized. Some in particular places, depending very much on which ligands have activated them. So for example ones that were particularly interested in are these nuclear pore proteins? And at least three or four of these proteins are known to be very tight binders, from how kinase has there are some proteins, like PE a 15, which keeps erk2 out of the nucleus. There are scaffolds that localized to the cytoskeleton. And to various organelles, for example, and ones that have very distinct cell type.  Dependent functions, such as these Ks are proteins. So scaffolding has a lot to do with it. And actually, this may be one of the least understood aspects of how these pathways are controlled. So about location. We started looking at nuclear localization along number of years ago, quite a long time ago. And what we found was, if we use to recombinant, erk2 and permeable, eyes cells, digit on Ian digit, Onan permeabilized cells. We could see that the protein  Localized in the nucleus whether or not we added an energy source or cytosolic transport factors. And here's a study with gfp R2, which you can see also localizes to the nucleus. In this case. We compared its nuclear localization in these, reconstitution studies to LSPs a import substrate used frequently to look at beta 1 dependent import and you can see here that import of LSPs, a requires transport.  Actors and it requires an energy source, that's a pie race eliminates its nuclear import. Whereas her to gets into the nucleus equally, pretty much, regardless of additional factors added. And, in fact, import carriers compete with her 24 entry, which is because our to binds to a similar location on nuclear pore proteins as the import factors. And so here, for example, is a schematic model of a nuclear pore.  Teens on the nuclear pore and some of these proteins contain, a whole string of f x, f g type motifs. And these were shown by Kerry cornfields lab to interact with map kinases in particular, erk1 and 2 with some selectivity and solar combined to these FX. F g motifs that are common on these nuclear pore proteins. And you can see here just\",\n",
       " 'Mj0T_byeKtQ': \"This is the first video on the series insulin and diabetes mellitus through this video will know how is insulin synthesized and how it is Strike. Leader from the bed, others time transplant has observed rynason. I and endocrine, I read insulin is secreted by the beautiful upper area situated at the center of Ireland alpha cells at the periphery secrete glucagon, Delta self-security somatostatin, and the Absurd signal pancreatic polypeptide. Now, let's look at how beta cells synthesize insulin.  And so is a peptide are basically insulin synthesis is a protein synthesis process. The bottom of the 11th chromosomes in the nucleus of beta cells course for the ins G.  The insulin Gene, this city is transcripted to, for my mRNA sequence, which gets translated to a signal sequence and eventually upon Eddie some of the sequences in the rough endoplasmic, reticulum, three proinsulin form this. Please, no insulin consists of the signal sequence, the hn beaten and the season.  A and B are held by three disulfide, linkages. The signal sequence is clipped off to form of proinsulin.  So, the bracelet has a b and c j.  So the quality is insulin is packaged in a secretory vesicle will see peptide is flipped off and insulin is form and it's stored within the vesicle. So what causes insulin release, the new tech for all new trends in brought gets increased. Basically, it is an incredible curve that triggers the insulin release glucose enters inside the bed. Others to glue two receptor. Remember beta cells like truth, too.  ^ 2 receptor is presented. That asserts the river, the intestinal cells and the kitten little transport is a two-way transport. So to prevent the transfer data from the set. It is phosphorylated by crew. Kind of course, 6 phosphate is under was oxidation to form ATP.  ATP sensitive products. Your channel is always presented but after which transports production out of the cells, so this ATV causes a close as the potassium Channel and further the increase in potassium, ions inside the cell and cause the cell to be depolarized. This depolarization causes opening of voltage-gated. Calcium channels and causes calcium in for this calcium causes  The release of insulin killed secretory vesicles are from the Shelf. This insulin secretion is biphasic. Meaning it offers inclusive within first. Few minutes of elevated blood glucose, plasma insulin increases up to 10 points, due to, The Dumping of preformed insulin is high insulin level decreases in of a 5 to 10-minute an oven reaches, a new plateau, in two to three hours, which results from additional delays are preforming insulin as well as release of new insulin.  Okay, so what causes insulin secretion?  Who played blood glucose, amino acids fatty acids?  In proteins. Look on growth hormone cortisol.  The parasympathetic is tourism and the beta adrenergic stimulation, all increases insulin secretion. So what are in Crittenden. They are the hormones secreted by the intestinal cells, glucagon-like peptide, glp-1 and glucose defendant in Saline O2 peptide.

       " 'qLiVXM': \"What's up, guys? Jeff cavaliere. Athleanx.com another bodyweight Wednesday workout video here for you. This time covering the back an area that a lot of guys say. Hey, how the hell do you cover that? If I don't have a pull-up bar, I would recommend you get a pull-up bar. They're not that much money. They are very, very versatile and allow you to do a whole lot of other things, but in athlean xero we say, you don't need anything. You don't need bars bench bands, pull up bars. Nothing we could get your workout today. I'm going to show you how to hit your upper your mid and your lower back, all the areas. But you need to hear if you want complete low back development. Okay. So first of all, upper back get on the floor, put your elbows on the ground. Like I've shown you here. This is a Back Widow. We actually use this in our athlean xero program. You drive your elbows into the ground. You can keep your feet flat on the floor. And what you're doing is you're driving the lift of your torso, your upper back off the ground via the elbows. Don't push through your feet. They're just there for support if needed, but you really want to be able to push through the upper back. That's how you're going to engage.  The rhomboids us are going to engage the traps. That's how you're going to engage the posterior, delts, to try to get you up and off of the ground. Okay, you go in the key here is to hold each repetition. Try to stick it, hold the contraction. Make sure that you got up there because of the back and not. Because of momentum. Next we move on to the last more in the mid back and the media area of our back. And yes, we can work this too, especially if we have nothing to use because what we have to do is that I always tell you look around, look at your surroundings, utilize some creativity, you can get the job done. So here  Looking out a pair of pants on a slick floor. And I have to say this ain't all that slick. This is concrete. I can do it though a little bit more friction, but it's going to make it a little bit tougher than say if you have a hardwood floor or linoleum floors like that, but the idea is you get yourself all the way to this. Fully out stretch position. Okay. I have my feet all the way back behind me. I have my arms all the way out, straight in front of me. When I do is I initiate this complete total body pull down, or pull over or drag all the way up to the top position. And then I lower myself back down.  You can see that this very much mirrors or mimics a pullover or at least a straight arm, pull down that, you know, I'm one of the biggest fans of that exercise to make it more difficult. Go all the way back up, onto your toes at the end. So, you're basically in a push-up position to then pull yourself out of if you want, you can actually drag your whole shit against the ground until you're up to the point where you then can pull the rest of your body up. So you can unweight some of your body by allowing your knees and shins to touch the ground. Finally, short of a combo exercise. I think one of the most important things  You do when you turn your low back is to train it with the muscles, it prefers to work with. So it likes to get some help from the glutes and it's also going to like to get some help from above from the lats that obviously tie in to your low back. So you can do that with this variation of basically a Superman, right? We're going to do it with our arms behind our body though. And you can see very subtly that actually rotating my shoulders back with each repetition. So even try to get a little bit of external rotation, to get the back here, are rotator cuff involved, so I'm actually  Eating a little external rotation and obviously the squeeze of the lats and then of course the glutes in the low back working together to hear the important thing is how long you hold it for try to hold it or stick that contraction. Again, for two to three seconds. Should you can make sure that the muscles that you want doing the job or doing the job and not just momentum. So guys, as you can see, bodyweight only doesn't mean that you have no options. As a matter of fact, some of these exercises like the second one in particular are so damn hard that you might have to dial them back. So that doesn't mean that you have to compromise.  My eyes on the difficulty of the exercise and therefore, the results you can get from doing them. If you're stuck at home. Using body weight, only do you lose a little bit of creativity? Like I said, you understand the concept of overload. You can get the job done. If you want help with that. I've got a complete six week program, where we build in exercises bodyweight exercises. Using nothing. No bars. No bands. No bench is nothing for your biceps as well as your back. Some of the challenging areas that people think you can never hit. We covered it all. It's our athlean xero program. You can get that over at athleanx.com and  meantime, if you found this video helpful, make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below. Let me know what else you want to see here, and I will do my best to cover it in the weeks ahead. All right, guys. I'll see you back here soon.\",\n",
       " 'MKKrOHNN3xQ': \"I am 55 years old, most of my adult life, you know, white over 215 pounds, tried all kinds of fad diets, exercise and diet pills, shakes Weight, Watchers, you name it? And I could lose, you know, 10 to 15 pounds and then I would just get it right back back in 1998, when I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, probably very similar or what they do. Now, the doctor put me on Metformin, you know, 500 Room to try to help level to come down. Then he sent me to a diabetes education class where the main topic that they talk was how to count your carbs, read the labels and and limit your carb intake, to no more than the way they had me doing it. Anyway, was like, 60 grams per meal number more than 15 for snacks. Not once did they refer to anything that had to do with fat and  Diabetes. Which, you know, after seeing the online Summit really opened my eyes, my A1C would range anywhere from ten point seven to seven point nine. I went up on my metformin usage because I wasn't really maintaining control of what I was eating and, you know, my diet.  And I was under a little bit of stress to around 2013, is when my, my primary care physician decided that it was time for me to now start taking Lance's so he started me on 25 units. Well, that took me a little over you to get up to where I was actually taking almost 110 units of it. My blood glucose wasn't under control and I was still heavy and I was still cholesterol was still high.  Triglycerides blood pressure everything. Now. I've also been dealing with heart disease since 1994. I've got nine stents. The last heart procedure that I had done was in February of this year. Prior to that December of 2016. My cardiologist had me come in to do a nuclear stress test, which is something that I've been doing every year. He saw an area that looks like.  Blood supply was low. So he decided I needed to have a heart cath done. So they could see what was going on. Okay, my experience had been stress test, heart, cath, one or two stents and go home, do 12 weeks of cardio rehab and you know, start all over again. Well, that didn't happen this time. This time. The cardiologist came out of the cath lab a lot quicker than he ever has.  Ben was telling my wife and myself that, you know, I had extensive blockages in my heart, which I don't think he was really surprised to see because this is the same one that's been putting my stints in and he was like, you need to actually get with your regular cardiologist. He said, because what I see is you need to have six bypasses.  I'll sit. Okay, and it just so happened that it was on February, the 3rd that I had the heart, cath done and the online Summit, the mastering diabetes online, Summit. The child did was during that same time frame. So for that Saturday and Sunday, my wife's it and watched every one of those people on the summit and were amazed. You know, what we were hearing and seeing and we were like, okay.  On one hand, you go in the hospital and you get these six bypasses done. On the other hand, listening to some of this information on the mastering diabetes Summit. It can be reversed. You don't have to do this. And that's when I decided, I didn't really want my chest cracked open like an egg and have my Plumbing rerouted. So I was like, okay, we're going to do this. My wife was on board with it just, it was fantastic.  We became members of the mastering diabetes, everything that we've been doing was plant-based whole food. I have not had any meat cheese. And when I say meat chicken was my big thing. I loved chicken and I could eat chicken forever. No breakfast, lunch and dinner, not anymore.  After seeing just, you know, all the stuff that I've seen in the information that I've gotten from you guys. It's just made such a big difference, big difference in the way that I see my food in the way that I eat and the way that I feel, it was nothing for me to sit down and eat a five pieces of chicken fried. Chicken.  And just you want to just sit back and take a nap, not do anything.  And I'm sure it did affect my thinking, also, you know, Cloud, eat everything. It wasn't good, but I didn't realize how good it could be. It was just a way of life. The transition process was so much easier than my life and I both expected. And in all mostly stemmed on the information that we had that we got from y'all. You know, again, it was like Bypass or lifestyle change.  Because we weren't looking at this as a diet. This wasn't going to be a diet. This was going to be a lifestyle change and that's exactly what we did. At first. It was a little scary because, you know, nutritionists and doctors are always telling you especially if you're diabetic. Watch your carbs. You can't eat the fruits. You can't eat, you know, the potatoes, you have to watch the breads going and seeing you know, that the plant-based whole food was  I can eat a cup of grapes. I could eat, you know, like that, like I do for my breakfast. Now, I've kind of gone to what Robbie does and I'll eat for fruits, you know, I'll cut up an apple banana a pair. I'll throw a cup of blueberries in on top of all that, I'll take cinnamon like Cyrus. I love cinnamon. I mean, I doused it in sediment also chia seeds on there and I've gotten to where I just about everything. Every time I each something for a meal because going to have  See the fresh or cook spinach off. I've gotten where I love spinach. So the transition was easier than we thought easier than we expected because of the frame of mind that we were in. You know, we were in, we were all in and we do, this is what we were going to do and we were going to watch and see what happened. And it's just, it's just been amazing to see the difference in the way that I feel the way that I eat.  The way that I even packed my moods my temperament, it's just it's better just all around. Better Baseline numbers, insulin usage, things like that. We're we're High. Average A1C was around eight point two. And again, I was still taking 100 units of Lantus. My blood pressure was high. My cholesterol was 230. My triglycerides were above 150 and I was still  Bill on the Lantus. I was still on two different types of blood pressure medicine. One, which was a beta blocker, which reduces your heart rate. I got to the point of thinking. Well, why am I doing that? Because my heart is not getting any stronger. If I'm keeping the rate of it down all the time. I was just not doing too well with my health and that was all before I started. Now, when I went to the plant-based.  Whole food diet. I gradually got off my first Egan volantis usage, went down like the first week down to, like, 35 from 110 to 35, because I was starting to go low. And even though I was eating to 250 carbs a day and it was all the fruit and the potatoes. I was like, this is this is this is working. This is good. So I was anxious to see what it was gonna do with my  Were all at one point. My cholesterol is down to 99 and then it went back up to 121 HDL, stayed up at a decent level of. My LDL was always really high in the triglycerides were high. My cholesterol instead was way down. My, the last A1C that I had done. Was six point one. So, it's way down my weight, weight 165 pounds. I haven't weighed this since high school and I'm 55. I've always thought Ben  Old once you get past 40 you can forget about losing weight. Never in a million years would I have thought how much weight I would lose doing this? Or I would have done this a long time ago. It's just fantastic to see the difference from eight months ago, you know from back in February as to where I'm at now just to give you an overall idea. When we came out to California, when you go through TSA line, you present your driver's license and your boarding. Pass guy. Looked at my driver's license was like  Like you've lost a lot of weight on you. Yeah, little bit. This is the way to go. If you're diabetic. It's definitely the way to go because of how much help you're going to get with your numbers and with your diabetes. It can be reversed. It's just amazing to see the changes that have happened in my body and knowing that it's not me. It's what I'm putting in my body. I've been doing the best I can to anybody that I find the talk them into try this.  Seven to ten days, you will see a major difference and you won't want to go back to eating this. Other stuff. Do not hesitate. Go at it as a lifestyle. Change. Don't go at it, is it diet? It's not a diet. It is a lifestyle, change. You'll be amazed at how much better you feel eating this way. The one key that my wife and I found that was very helpful. When we started was to focus on what we could eat. Not what we shouldn't eat, but what we could eat  Master your diabetes, don't hesitate even if you're not diabetic, if you want to keep from becoming a diabetic do this, then you'll just you'll just be amazed at how much, how much better you'll feel and how much how much the food tastes better and all the options that you actually have.\",\n",
       " 'LmKq5bQOg0': \"My story starts in November of 2016 and at the time I was really confident and I loved myself and I just thought I was skinny, and I thought I was under way because my doctor said that my BMI was an underweight. We am? I being underweight in my school is like normal. You need to be underway to be perfect and beautiful. So I'd like, dang, I got this under control. Took him to lunch table one day and I told my friends and I said, well, my doctor says, I'm underweight and I'm really happy about that. So one of my friends asked me, Um, are you sure you're under way? I mean, what's your weight Isabel? I just kind of froze and I kind of like try to I try to change the conversation, but they wouldn't let me. So I said I'm 115 pounds of corn to the weight, the scale this morning. She said, whoa, I don't know if that's underweight. Some people at the table started tagging along as I will. I don't know if that's underway as well. That sounds average the word average, kind of struck me. I'm like, average being underweight means you're beautiful, not average. Average means that you're like normal people.  Apple and not unique for the next couple months. I kept looking in the mirror, like every mirror. I had a kind of looked into it, and I stared at it. And I'm like, my face is so round and my stomach sticks out too much and my thighs are huge. My arms are fat just kind of looked in the mirror and I'm like, I'm not perfect. So one day I looked in the mirror and I said, this needs to change, I need to lose weight. So I started restricting my eating and I skipped breakfast and dinner occasionally, and sometimes even skip lunch and up losing.  Some muscles and I couldn't do like push-ups, like I couldn't Taekwondo. You could see my ribs and stuff, but I thought that was normal. I thought that seeing ribs and your arms being sticks and you looking super skinny and, and having like a jawline, that's is defined and sticks out and cheekbones is perfect.

       " 'MMwdz1kLsFU': \"This young man had a problem where he he has diabetes. He stepped on a nail and he got a very serious infection and he got an ulcer on the bottom of his foot and it was down here underneath the second metatarsal and then it got an infection and it just sucked it up here and went all the way across his foot and then up through his foot and there was a hole all the way through the foot. When we first clean this out there was badly infected and he's been on this thing called a wound. Vac. Which is a negative pressure. Wound therapy machine for about five weeks and he's improved a lot in those five weeks. And here in the next couple of weeks. We hope to get him back to work. And on with his life. This just shows a lot of different principles of taking care of a diabetic foot and I'll talk to you a little bit about those. The first one is, you know, this probably could have been prevented with appropriate preventive measures like a good insole or custom made.  Eight device inside the shoe to take pressure off these areas, you know, once you did get an ulcer then that could have been treated with offloading may be a total contact cast by some Misfortune. He ended up getting a really bad infection. And so now we're kind of stuck dealing with a lot of tissue loss and he's doing pretty good with that.  And once we get him back up on his feet, there are some things we can do to sort of prevent this from ever happening again. So what we're going to apply now is collagen, and what collagen is, is the building block, that sort of like a scaffold for tissue to grow into and that's one of the reasons we've been able to get this patient to heal. So rapidly, he had a lot of tissue loss with a big defect and he's all filled in now because we've been using this college and material and collagen is, you know,  Just a white powdery substance and just put it on the wound. Put it up out.  A quarter thickness, we're going to put this sponge on. Now, what this sponge does. This sponge is a, it's an open cell foam, which means it all communicates with itself. Let's say you were to put one half of the sponge in the water and suck on it. The water would come. All the way up through the sponge if it was all sealed, because that's what open cell foam means. It means that it's, it's open all the way down. So this is open cell foam and that's kind of how it works. So now you can see the sponge. It's all nice and puffy. It's not squeeze down at all.  We cut a hole in this sealer, that we've wrapped around his foot.  Attach the  The part that goes to the suction canister.  Plug that in.  So what this thing does, is it maintains a pressure of - 125 millimeters of mercury continuously or you can set it up for alternating pressure. But basically that the principle of it is it increases circulation in the area in the area of the wound by about anywhere from 25 to 40 percent depending on the study that you agreed. And so, what this does is it romantically increases the rate of healing that occurs inside this foot. So, this thing cuts the Heat  Time probably. If you with a would like the one that you had it would probably would have taken two or three months to heal and this has been about a month. So, with collagen, and the wound VAC, you know, we've really dramatically decrease the curing time for him to get back to work and normal lifestyle. We'll see you soon. Maybe about 5 or 5 days, okay.\",\n",
       " 'MOH33-jFOwo': \"If a doctor is concerned that a patient either has diabetes or is at risk from diabetes. They might suggest an A1C test to be performed. And what I want to do in this video is one, just explore what A1C even means. And also how that actually relates to diabetes or a high or the site of the main side effect of diabetes, which is having high blood sugar or hyperglycemia. So to do that, let's think about, let's think about red blood cells and I know what you're King, what does this have to do with diabetes? And we'll get there in a little bit. So red blood cells are the main oxygen carriers in our blood. They kind of look like these. Like these lozenges and inside of red blood cells, you have hundreds of millions of hemoglobin molecules hemoglobin proteins. Let me draw some hemoglobin proteins. You actually have the number. I found is two to three hundred million / /, red, blood cell. And then we have tens of trillions of red blood cells. We have a lot of hemoglobin in  Has and hemoglobin is what makes red blood cells red when hemoglobin is bound to oxygen. It has a red color. So this right here each of those are hemoglobin protein hemoglobin. Now, it turns out that hemoglobin. Let me draw a bigger version of it hemoglobin if it has some glucose around. So let me draw some glucose floating around near the hemoglobin. If it has some glucose around, there is some chance. It's not a high probability, but there's  Chance of the hemoglobin and the glucose bump into each other, at just the right way that they'll buy, they'll bind to each other. And so you'll have this situation where you have glucose bound to the hemoglobin. Now this, this this hemoglobin with a glucose bound to it, is called glycated hemoglobin gly, glycated hemoglobin. I wrote glycated in green for because I'm using  green for the for the glucose. So glycated hemoglobin and another name for glycated hemoglobin or hemoglobin that has some glucose bound to. It is hemoglobin A1c. Hemoglobin.  A1C. And now I can imagine things are starting to click in your brain when you are measuring your A1C levels. That's a test of the percentage of your hemoglobin. That is hemoglobin A1c. So you take a blood test. They're measuring the relative to the total amount of hemoglobin there. How, what percentage of that is hemoglobin, is hemoglobin A1c and a normal range of that. So, if you just have normal blood sugar over a  The bull amount of time you're going to have a hemoglobin A1c level in kind of the for four to six percent range and people are still kind of trying to tighten up these ranges and it doesn't completely correlate a tightly with blood sugar. It does correlate, but there's still people with the same blood sugar can still have fairly different A1C levels, but four to six percent is considered normal is considered normal. And if you have higher higher than seven or  or eight percent so greater than seven to eight percent. So, if you had a, like an A1C level of nine or ten percent, that's high, that's high. And so you can imagine this is kind of a proxy for how much glucose you have in your bloodstream because the more glucose that you have in your bloodstream, the the higher the probability that that glucose is going to react with the actual hemoglobin so that you're going to have a higher percentage of hemoglobin A1c. And the other reason why this is useful, it's kind of like  You can see on the first pass, it's useful because it's not one of these snapshot test. Everything we've talked about so far, with respect to diabetes is taking your blood sugar at any one point in time. And we know that your blood sugar changes throughout the day it changes depending on how active you are changes, depending on what you might have. Just eaten. So when you take, when you do blood sugar, you're just getting a sample. You don't know what the blood sugar is throughout the damage. You just kept sampling it, which could get a pretty annoying keep, you know, keep freaking your needle with A1c.  This starts to become a measure of how much glucose you have in your blood over a longer period of time. And in general is kind of used as a measure for the last few months because the red blood cells and the hemoglobin in them. They have a lifespan of about 120 days, 120 Day, Life Span. Now that obviously doesn't mean that all of your hemoglobin gets produced on one day and then I'll dies 120 days later. You have some red blood cells and hemoglobin. That might be a few seconds.  Then you have some that might be approaching 120 days old. So on average they're going to be about 60 days older about two months old. So when you're measuring this percentage, you're you're definitely not getting the percentage of anything older than 120 days. And on average you're seeing things that are from about two months old. So the higher this percentage, this is saying, wow, things, you know, my average, my average hemoglobin molecule in my body is only maybe 60 days old at this point and already seven to eight percent of them seven to eight percent.  None of them have already been glycated, which is an indicator that I probably have more blood sugar than a normal person. In a normal situation. Only four to six percent of, of my of my hemoglobin would get glycated. So, hopefully that explains what A1C is. And, but I do want to say, you know, and I said at the beginning, the video, I'm not a Doctrine. And even if even amongst doctors, the A1C test or the A1C measurement, it's a little bit there. It's a there's there's some debate about how useful.  Is whether what, what it's measuring or kind of how far back it actually is a good view at kind of your glucose levels. And also, as I mentioned to people with the exact same blood sugars could have different A1C levels depending on other things, how old they are or whether they have some other type of medical condition.\",\n",

What was this is the opportunity for us to implement those findings in a way that the population can experience it Kim. Looking at far, how far you've come? What else? Do you see? I mean, what else is out there? Where else do you want to go in their core? 16 weeks of this program, participant will come in and meet once a week with their facilitator and their small group. We'll sit down and we'll discuss one of our 16 lifestyle topics for that day.  I have to pre diabetic for over two and a half years and I've just kind of ignored it because that word free was there.  I knew that my blood sugar was high. I would watch my diet a little bit and then I would stop, but I didn't do anything consistently on a consistent basis.  There's an issue with the patient's, not realizing the problem is as bad as it is or as bad as it may become.  Big bro. Chicken burgers. And they all had them though. So in the first few weeks of the program, we're talking all about bet G intake, behavior modification, your level of activity and how Physically Active that you are during the day and Stress Management, Stress Management is a very important piece when it comes to lifestyle change affects people's eating. It affects people's physical activity. It  Everything that has to do with lifestyle change. A lot of people think you have to have machines and tracks and things like that to constitute exercise. Will. We look at in the class is how active are you really throughout the day? I like to walk early in the morning. It gets you day started and it's good, little power walk and it's free. It doesn't cost anything to walk here.  Six, so initially I was in denial about the fact that there's a higher percentage of African Americans affected by diabetes than other ethnic groups, but all around me. Friends family, church members. I was seeing younger and younger people affected by the disease.  One of the things that we were required to do was to set a goal of weight loss that a nutritional goal because we established what our fat G content had to be for the day. We were to set in our books. Exactly how many minutes we were going to exercise every day?  The real success is that people are working together to try to find the solutions and to support each other. Without the class. I would have never done this on my own because I had tried I had done every single thing out there that I could think of my hope for this program is that many Physicians across our community will use this Resource as their first line of defense against type 2 diabetes. That's what our program is here for. This is really the example of what we wish would happen in many.  Fronts is that the government, the private sector and the community sector would really join forces and come together to solve these problems. My patients love, the idea of being able to have a program to be healthier going forward, my patients really love that. They're surprised that they can actually get older and Beyond fewer medications. I am so excited because I went to the doctor last week all of my numbers were down and I am officially no longer breathe.  Diabetic.  They're almost 80 million people that have prediabetes.  My dream. Is that in the next few years. It will be easy for people to get access to this program. And ultimately we will be able to say fewer people are developing type 2 diabetes.\",\n",

Actually hyper absorb glucose so that they may absorb even more glucose although because of hyperglycemia. There's more glucose in the urine. Therefore. It makes perfect sense to try to inhibit that excessive uptake of glucose as a  Its strategy for type 2 diabetes. Certainly the majority of patients with type 2. Diabetes are not getting to goal with our current serve these and a syrupy that can function such that it does not cause weight gain. And in fact might cause weight loss and does not require increased insulin secretion would be a benefit. So, it turns out that 90% of the glucose that's absorbed in the proximal.  To Buhl is absorbed through a mechanism, using a transporter known as the sodium glucose transporter, number 2 or sglt2, which is a lower Affinity. But high-capacity transporter in the proximal tubules and 90% of the glucose that is in the proximal, tubules is resorb through this mechanism. The 10% that escapes is generally taken up in the so-called S3 segment of the proximal tubule by a sodium glucose transporter called.  G LT 1, it turns out there for since the both of the glucose is absorbed through sglt2 that it is a reasonable Target for inhibition to treat diabetes. Furthermore, because SG, L T1 is also found in the gut. It has been shown that non specific Inhibitors such as floors in can induce diarrhea because of blocking the SG, L T1, so picking  Elective sglt2 Inhibitors makes a lot of sense. I was going to ask, you do these agents, do anything else to improve glycemic control? Do they affect beta cell function or insulin sensitivity? Well, it turns out that directly. It's not clear that they do however, indirectly, because they improve glycemic control because they do not enhance enhance insulin secretion directly that they reduce glucose toxicity. That's  Demonstrated they induce weight loss and therefore enhance both insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. Now, there are several agents in development, only to have been approved. Is that correct in the United States? Canada Flows In has been approved and is on the market. In Europe, dap ago, flows and has been approved that bag of flows and in particular has a 1200 fold.  Tivity for sglt2 / SG, LT1 Hannah has about a two hundred. Fold selectivity of sglt2 / SG, L, T1, the initial concerns in the United States were although there were no reports of increased overall cancer with Deepika flows and that there was a signal for prostate bladder and breast cancer. And therefore it was initially not approved in the United States. However, it is currently sitting for FDA approval.  Oval consideration as we speak. And there's another one that's been submitted to the FDA, right? And pick a flows in a glass flows in a calf lows. In also has been studied. It is also an sglt2 Inhibitors. That is highly selective. All of the three these three sglt2 Inhibitors actually. Have a C-Max at two hours, that is to say they act very quickly. They're all very specific to sglt2 now.  Where do they Stack Up? In terms of efficacy and lowering hba1c have. There? Haven't been any head-to-head comparisons within the class, but there have been comparisons between these agents and sulfonylureas and dpp-4 Inhibitors. Where do they stack up? These agents certainly have comparable? Hemoglobin A1c, lowering to dpp-4 Inhibitors. They have comparable, perhaps  Teeny bit less effort efficacy compared to sulfonylureas or metformin depending on the study. You look at, but certainly there is between 0.5 and 1 percent hemoglobin A1c reduction in most of the studies that have been performed using these sglt2 Inhibitors now because these agents cause loss of calories in the urine, they induce some weight loss and  Where do they stand with side effects? Like hypoglycemia effects on urinary? Tract infections or genital tract infections? Yes, in terms of hypoglycemia. There is minimal to no hypoglycemia that's been reported both in combination with metformin in combination with dpp-4 s and as mono therapy.  In the presence of sulfonylureas, there can be some hypoglycemia, but it's very unusual. And certainly one would be cautious when using secreted, gags, or insulin in combination with these. In that the dosage might need to be reduced. As far as urinary tract infections are concerned. There is a small increase in urinary tract infections that has been reported in most of the studies using sglt2 Inhibitors the  Concern along those lines has been more in terms of mycotic Volvo, vaginal infections, especially and to some degree balanitis, which has been reported, especially in uncircumcised males. Now, there haven't been any long-term studies of safety on the kidney. Do we worry about adverse effects of this mechanism on kidney function?  There seems to be in patients especially with moderate renal dysfunction that. There's a mild decrease in calculated glomerular filtration rate based on the formula of egfr looking at creatinine levels, but these are clinically small there on the order of Falls and 3 to 4 ml per minute that don't transient the right, and they are transient.  They made to some degree. Be based on fluid fluxes because of the osmotic diuresis that accursed. Now. This is a hereditary condition for me. Leo, glycosuria. Do these people get into kidney problems? They don't just to be more specific. Most of the cases of familial glycosuria, are due to mutations in sglt2.  To and these people do not appear to get hypoglycemic. They do not appear to have really any significant abnormalities particularly in the heterozygous forms. There are unusual forms such as mutations of hepatic nuclear factors where you get other dis other disorders, that go along with it, but that does not pertain to sglt2 Inhibitors. Now as I recall, the Ada,  Headlines. These agents would seem to stack up very favorably against what we have at present. They unlike your secreted, God's, you don't have a risk of hypoglycemia. Don't get any weight gain. They have a diuretic action. So you don't get any Dima so far. There have been no bone changes. Where do you think these fit?  It right now. Everyone, pretty much uses metformin as a starter. Where would you place these agents? Well, certainly.  We're cost not an issue. I think that these could very very well be a good second-line therapy after failure for metformin. They if anything drop blood pressure a teeny bit they cause weight loss they enhance insulin sensitivity by ameliorating glucose toxicity, presumably and enhance insulin secretion. They as you said, don't cause bone loss. They don't cause hypoglycemia. They don't cause Gia.  Set as far as we can see. So they look to be excellent drugs because they appear to be safe and efficacious and do the things that we'd like them to do as opposed to, for example, sulfonylureas which after insulin or the highest are the leading causes of hypoglycemia worldwide. I see a role for these agents as a potential competitor, for prandial insulin, these agents work on both fasting and postprandial level.  Owls. And if you have a person on, let's say, metformin and a basal insulin and they're not achieving their hba1c goal. It's usually because of not controlling postprandial glucose. So you could use this agent to try and control the postprandial glucose levels, and not have to have injections or  Frequent monitoring of plasma glucose or risk of weight gain and hypoglycemia. I think that's an excellent point. I think that you absolutely could use them. And in those patients, especially who are lean type twos because they've had it for a long time, in patients, who have latent autoimmune diabetes, and that's not an insignificant population from the overall diabetic population. These absolutely could be considered to substitute.  For insulin. And the good thing about them is that they only really work when the glucose level exceeds. The renal threshold and they have durability because they don't depend on beta cell function. So, as long as you maintain,\",\n",

I'll talk about some unpublished as yet unpublished data establishing the role a role for the dorsal. Raphe, nucleus is a key node in the circuit that regulates food intake and then  I'll also talk about some new data establishing a role for the hypothalamus, to regulate feeding, in a particular glucose metabolism.

One of the clinical manifestations of the circuit that we study pertains to obesity. And we, of course, as would others like to understand why it is some individuals in the  Population have an appearance like this and others have an appearance like this. And there are many different viewpoints in particular in public discourse about What might explain the difference between these two appearances or the individual who might appear one way or the other, the first would be to suggest that the obese person lacks a level of willpower. That's normally evident in lean people. Find that point of view, as more often favored by lean people. The second possibility is that obesity is  A disease of modernity, it's a result of an alteration in lifestyle and the environment that creates a predisposition to obesity. And the third possibility that's considered is the differences in weight are attributed to biological or genetic factors at various times. I've taken votes about what people think is the most important contributor before. And after I speak, I stopped doing that when fewer people voted for biology, when I was done.  Then when I began. So I'm not going to do that today. Rather. I'll just point out something which is that people tend to think of the cause of obesity is being one or the other of these to the exclusion of the other two, and where I talking about any other biologic, any other condition people would immediately gravitate the idea that there's a biological framework on which behavioral and environmental factors act. And so I think all contribute, but I'd like to at least leave  Leave you with the conclusion, if possible, or if I'm capable of it, that there is an important biological framework that actually gives you an opportunity to think about how behavioral and environmental factors might exert their effects. Now, there's a long list of data that would support the notion that biological engine and genes could biological factors of genes contribute. I won't go through that in any detail other than to say that some of the most powerful evidence.  From hereditability studies that have established that obesity is as or more hereditable than any trait that's been studied, with the exception of height and this strong hereditability. You are percent of the variants. That can be ascribed to genetic factors is evident even in twin studies in which the identical twins reared apart. So there's I think very strong evidence that genetic factors play a critical role in the development of obesity and to illustrate the power of such genetic.  Actors, I want to tell you briefly of a case report contributed by Steve-O, rally and colleagues, and Cambridge studying a young boy, whose image. I began by showing you. This child was a normal weight at Birth, but quickly began to develop morbid obesity in infancy with unrestrained hyperphagia. He was already pre-diabetic of the age of four, when he weighed 90 pounds with 57 percent body fat. Now. This child came from a highly inbred pedigree. Which often  Suggest that that the, the extreme phenotype might be a result of a recessive mutation and a rally. Notice some features in common some of which I'll share with you in a few moments between the phenotype of this child and a genetically obese Mouse. We've been studying. This is the OB Mouse described by Jackson at the Jackson, lab by George Snell, and colleagues. And this animal here weighs three times as much and as 5 times.  As much fat as a normal Mouse, despite the fact that it lives in the same cage with the same access to food as a sibling littermate. Now, as I just mentioned, this is the result of a fully penetrant autosomal recessive gene. Now, I become interested in this mutation not because of necessarily a priori interested obesity. But rather an interest in the molecular basis of behavior, which is you'll see we continue to explore because you could also look at this animal is a  Our mutant, the animal eats and unrestrained matter. Now, we had set out to study these animals and identify the defective Gene. I'll make one other point though, that I'll come back to which is that the phenotype of these animals is complicated and includes a number of other abnormalities that are not typically evident in obese. Humans. The animals are hypothermic there infertile. They have immune abnormalities. In fact, they have abnormalities in just about every biological  Mmm, and there was no ready. Explanation for this constellation of abnormalities. That would not typically be seen in the obese patient. And I think this set of findings LED some at least two question as to how relevant this Gene might be to human physiology after an eight-year effort. We identified the defective Gene in these mice, has encoding a novel adipose tissue hormone, which renamed leptin. And by all criteria leptin is the afferent signal on negative feedback loop that maintains homeostatic control of fat, man.  Leptin is secreted from fat, in proportion to its mass. It circulates in Blood and activates discrete sets of hypothalamic and other neurons to control food intake. If body weight goes up, leptin goes up and suppresses appetite. If body weight is lost, leptin, goes down and increases appetite. And by this mechanism, body weight can be regulated within a relatively narrow range, and I don't want to leave you with the impression. That leptin is the only factor that  It's appetite, it's not but I view it as setting the gain on the system so that it exists in a sense exerts and biological force that resists way changing in in either direction, other things might counter man, that Force, but the force is there, nonetheless in the OB Mouse. There's a mutation in the leptin Gene. No signal is generated at their adequate fat stores, unrestrained, appetite develops.  And animals become obese now because leptin is a circulating peptide hormone. You can make it in the laboratory. If you make it a laboratory and give it to mice. Here's what's happened. This is an OB Mouse given saline. This is an OB Mouse given leptin. You can normalize the weight of these animals with intraperitoneal injections over the course of about two to three weeks. Why do the animals lose weight? Well, for one thing they eat less. What's shown here is an experiment showing that food intake goes down by about two-thirds.  In OB, OB animals, receiving leptin, therapy, but the animals also move around more. Now. Let's see and I just want to briefly show you a video to exhibit this. This is a left untreated animal. You'll note that the OB Mouse exhibits what's referred to as locomotor retardation it sits in the corner and doesn't move the left. Untreated animal moves. Normally this animal has been treated for a while, but it turns out that you can see this increased Locomotion within a day of leptin.  RP, you can see effects on Locomotion, even before you see effects on food intake. And so, this further suggests that leptin is doing more than regulating food intake and for, and furthermore, suggest that that Locomotion is also under genetic and neural control. Now, with this information in hand, as I mentioned O'Reilly suggested that the child whose image I showed you might have a leptin mutation and indeed up on sequencing and Analysis of plasma levels. The child had a mutation.  In the same mutation, that one of the mouse strains has and makes no leptin. So here again, O'Reilly used, clinically appropriate, leptin and gave it to this child. And here's the result. This is the child at the age of three and the child at the age of eight. He was of the same two images. I began by showing you. And I think these data suggest that what what's driving obesity at least in this child, is not a lot.  Lack of willpower or a modern environment. It's a lack of the hormone leptin. Now lepton mutations is a cause of obesity is rare. That's to be expected for hormones, which are poor targets for mutation. There are only a few dozen such patients worldwide. And so while we can say with some confidence that leptin\",\n",

I want to emphasize that my perspective is coming from one with type 2 and not type 1 diabetes. Our channel is primarily for those with type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes today. I want to answer the question.  My father has diabetes. Should I be screened for pre-diabetes on a regular basis?  After you watch the video today, I invite you to check out the description box for my new ebook. This is one of the most comprehensive diabetes meal planning books. You'll find anywhere it contains. Diabetes friendly meals and recipes recipes for different goals. Such as eight hundred, two 1800 calories per day, meal plans, diabetes meal, planning and tips and tricks. And there are also tons of diabetes friendly recipes for everyone.  Diabetes is a complex condition. Several factors must come together for you to develop type 2 for example, obesity and a sedentary lifestyle play a role, but genetics can also influence, whether you'll get this disease. The really needs to be more research in the field of prediabetes, but there seems to be a link especially given the fact that many with pre-diabetes develop type 2 within 10 years. Now this  Article is based on genetic links with time to simply because the research isn't extensive enough for prediabetes, but I honestly feel the comparisons are closely related and can be extrapolated. Now, if you've been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, there's a good chance that you're not the first person with diabetes in your family. According to the American Diabetes, Association your risk of developing type 2. Diabetes is one in seven.  If one of your parents was diagnosed before the age of 51 in 13, if one of your parents was diagnosed after the age of 51 into, if both, your parents have diabetes, several gene mutations have been linked to the development of type to these gene. Mutations can interact with the environment and each other to further, increase your risk. Now, the role of genetics in type 2 diabetes. Well, it's there.  And it's also an environmental Factor. Scientists have linked several gene mutations to a higher risk of diabetes. Not everyone who cares, a mutation will get diabetes. But many people with diabetes do have one or more of these mutations and it can be very difficult to separate genetic risk from environmental risks. The latter is often influenced by your family members, for example, parents with healthy eating habits are likely to pass.  Come On To The Next Generation. On the other hand. Genetics play a big part in determining weight. Sometimes, behaviors. Can't take all the blame.  Studies of twins. Suggest that type 2 diabetes might be linked to genetics. These studies were Complicated by the environmental influences, that also affect type two risks to date numerous mutations have been shown to affect type 2. Diabetes risk, the contribution of each gene is generally small. However, each additional mutation, you have, seems to increase that risk in general mutations and any  Involved in controlling glucose levels can increase your risk of type 2 diabetes. These include genes that control the production of glucose the production and regulation of insulin. How glucose levels are sensed in the body genes associated with type 2, diabetes include tcf7l2, which affects insulin secretion and glucose production, a bcc8, which helps regulate insulin capn.  Zero which is associated with type 2. Diabetes risk in mexican-americans blood to which helps move glucose into the pancreas. The gcg are a glucagon hormone involved in glucose regulation. Now, tests are available for some of the gene mutations associated with type 2. The increased risk for any mutation is small. However, other factors are far more accurate predictors of whether you'll develop type 2, diabetes.  Including your BMI your family history, high blood pressure, high triglycerides and cholesterol levels, history of gestational diabetes, and being a certain ethnicity such as Hispanic African American or Asian American.  Now we do have some tips for prevention, the interaction between genetics and the environment. Make it difficult to identify a definite cause of type 2. That doesn't mean you can't reduce your risk through changing your habits, a large study of people at high risk, for diabetes, suggest that weight loss and increased physical activity can prevent or delay type 2. According to the diabetes, prevention program. Here are some things you can do to start today.  And we have many videos on this already but start an exercise program slowly add physical activity into your daily routine. For example, take the stairs instead of the elevator part further away from the building entrances. You can also try going for a walk. Drink lunch. Once you're ready. You can start adding light weight training and other cardiovascular activities your aim 30 minutes of exercise. Each day five days a week. You also need to eat.  The year, it can be hard to avoid extra carbohydrates and calories when you're dining out cooking. Your own meals, is easiest way to make healthier choices. You can ease yourself into it, to start by planning your lunches for the week. Once you're comfortable with that, you can plan out additional meals.  Choose healthy, snacks. Try things like carrot, sticks, instead of that candy bar apples or other fruits. Fruits are a wonderful source of fiber and most cases and are great healthy snacks. A handful of nuts air-popped popcorn. Don't add a lot of salt or butter and eating crackers and cheese. Now knowing your risk for type 2. Diabetes can help you make changes to prevent developing the condition. Tell your doctor about your family history. They can decide if  Testing is right for you. They can also help you reduce your risk through lifestyle changes. Your doctor may also want to regularly schedule your glucose levels.  Check those that can help them detect, any blood sugar, abnormality, or warning signs for type 2 earlier earlier treatment can be a positive impact on your outlook. Now just because your father had diabetes, should you be screened for diabetes on a regular basis or prediabetes? Well, that's really up to you. There seems to be a genetic link. So talk to your healthcare provider, see what they have to say about at least yearly blood.  Screenings and A1C test for you.

       " '4hTBVFyyKs': \"Hey guys, in this video. We're going to talk about how to fix hypoglycemia. All right. Now, what is Hypoglycemia? Hypoglycemia is a situation where the blood sugar is go too low. Now normally in the body you should have blood sugar's of 100. What does that mean? That I'll give you a little comparison. If you were to way, let's say 180 pounds and you'd have about a gallon and a half of blood in your entire body, the amount of sugar that would be diluted in there to equal 100 would be about 1 teaspoon. So it's  Really very small amounts of sugar, and it doesn't mean you have to eat sugar. Your body can make sugar from other types of things like, protein, even fat. So it's not that you're have to even eat any sugar at all. But the point is, we need this normal blood sugar to maintain fuel in the body. Okay. It should be 100 when it drops down below, 70. That's when you start getting the symptoms of hypoglycemia brain, fog cravings for sweets anxiety, fatigue, shaking this week. He  - it's kind of like if you have kids, you know, and you let's say you're bringing them grocery shopping with you when they're hungry and tired. They're going to experience all these specifically irritability, right? And that's a low blood sugar. You just going to kind of go a little crazy on you. So the point is that when those blood sugar's crash, it pushes you out of the present. You don't think rationally and you'll eat things that you end up regretting. So here's what happens in this is the problem is that  The doctors and the medical profession is telling people to keep some candy in their pocket or glucose tablets in case your blood sugar's run low. Go ahead and take some candy and bring it back up. Right? And these are even diabetics. So they're looking at this problem very superficially, you know, it's like it's going to get you stub, your toe and we'll just here just take a pain pill every time you stub your toe. But like why don't we just look at why you're stubbing your toe on the same spot.  So the the why is this? If you're taking medication and it's spiking, it insulin too high and your blood sugars are coming down too fast. It could be that you're taking too much medication. Okay, so you seem to lessen the medication rather than try to correct it at the blood sugar level to add more sugar into the mix, which will create more problem. Why not? Just take a little less next time to even it out. That's one solution, next solution.  To get out of the diet, what triggers this, in the first place? And I have a ton of videos on that. I'll put them down below, you know, the sugar is refined carbohydrates, and things like that, but I want to tell you an equally important thing and it has to do with the opposing hormone to insulin. Okay, insulin reacts to glucose. And what it does is, it lowers blood sugar? And so there's a hormone that does the opposite.  And it's made by the pancreas. So insulin is made by the pancreas, but this hormone is also made by the pancreas to and this is the missing piece and I'm going to explain why it's called.  Glucagon glucagon. Okay, so that kind of does the opposite of insulin, so if insulin lowers blood sugar's glucagon, raises blood sugars. Okay. So what it does it does is it mobilizes in releases stored sugar from your liver and even the muscles. So, you have this thing called glycogen that's torture glucagon. Releases that to keep the sugar.  Sugar's constant. So you have this constant thing where your insulin and glucagon are working together. All right. So now here's the question. Why don't we just increase glucagon instead of eating candy?  Why don't we do that? Well, because people don't really understand what triggers glucagon. So I'm teaching you right now. The main food that will trigger glucagon is ready for this protein.  Moderate amount of protein a lot. Just you see the moderate between 3 to maybe 5 ounces of protein. Protein will trigger glucagon and I have a little story. I had blood sugar issues when I was very young. And then one day for breakfast, I would normally have like a carbohydrate breakfast. I decided to have some protein and it was like a switch. I instantly, like could think again. I was feeling so much better. Mentally. I was clear. It was  All foggy like I used to be. And that was because of this situation right here. So it brought it up normally. So the point is, if you're doing a very low protein diet, and you're not having protein with each meal and I'm just saying, have a lot, just a little bit, especially in the morning. If you're going to have breakfast, then you could be having this hypoglycemic reaction. So that's one cause and other one, be reading too much sugar. The third one would be, you're basically eating your you're a diabetic.  Medic, and you're taking medication, that's too much and you need to adjust that, but it's hypoglycemia is very, very easy to correct. If you understand this right here. I put some links down below of the eating plan for like insulin resistance and things like that. But the point I want to make is instead of going for that candy in your pocket, protein would be the thing. You need to do to drive it up. And then as far as a meal goes, to really correct. This even long-term. You don't want to have snacks.  Between the meal. Now. I know hypoglycemics need to eat between the meals because their blood sugar's crash. Well, a much better thing would be to do would be to add a little fat with that meal. So you have like a good amount of vegetables, protein, and fat healthy fats like avocado or coconut oil or or even some animal fats if you're or even butter, but the point is that you do that that will not Spike insulin, it gets you to go longer.  Less Spike drops in blood sugars. And if you do that consistently, you can actually heal this whole mechanism and completely not be hypoglycemic anymore. It's also good for hyperglycemic glycemia as well. That's diabetes. So I wanted to mention this point about proteins. So stop you having the candy in the pocket. Don't do the glucose tablets. I mean even have like these little shakes, you can do a sugar you just you never going to fix your problem that way. So do the  Teen, and put your comments below. Thank you for watching.\",\n",

Sometimes referred to as adult onset, diabetes doesn't have to be permanent fasting and calorie restriction. Can help you get control of your blood sugar lower, your blood pressure and even help reverse type 2 diabetes, but before we get into how fasting can undo the damage of type 2 diabetes, we first need to understand how type 2. It affects the body. How does type 2 diabetes, develop diabetes, develops. When fat accumulates in areas of the body, that shouldn't accumulate fat. It all starts with an abundance of fat in your muscle tissue. Typically, this is caused by a family history, poor diet or sedentary lifestyle. This fat is called intramuscular fat. It's like the marbling on a steak only, it's inside your muscles and it causes insulin resistance, the characteristic that defines  Distinguishes type 1, diabetes from type. 212 even worse. Intramuscular fat causes muscles to produce. Toxic fat metabolites, like ceramide and diacylglycerol. Daj. These toxins also contribute to insulin resistance High insulin levels lead to a fatty liver, when blood sugar is high, the pancreas produces insulin to lower blood sugar. However, insulin resistance causes the liver to stop responding to  Insulin 4.5. In fact, the liver keeps producing sugar, despite a high level of sugar in the blood consuming food that's high in sugar is like throwing gas on the fire. And the abundance of sugar is converted to fat and stored in the liver for when the liver accumulates fat. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease nafld can develop when non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is present. The liver releases fat into the bloodstream, where it  Distributed to other organs and they just like the liver stopped responding to insulin. Especially affected is the pancreas five that cripples pancreatic function as fat builds up in the pancreas. Its function is compromised since the pancreas is responsible for producing insulin. This is a major issue. Predictably insulin production drops reducing body fat can help normalize blood sugar, but a lot of people  Insulin injections, instead insulin injections help in the short term but also increase fat formation throughout the body including the liver and pancreas which leads to other health issues 6. Fortunately, there is a better way, reversing type 2 diabetes through fasting for almost 150 years. We've known that fasting has serious benefits for those with diabetes in the 1870s doctorate in are Bouchard it.  An expert on Diabetes. During his time noticed that fasting produced positive results for his diabetic patients 7 over 100 years ago.

Are these guys right here, the portal vein, the hepatic artery and the common hepatic, bile duct together. These three make What's called the portal Triad. It's one of the structures that are very important to identify in surgery and also is seen very commonly in the liver when we look at smaller cuts of the organ. So if we were to focus in on a smaller section like that, and  Blow it up so we can get a better picture of what's going on here. We can see that the liver itself is giant fatty organ is split up into smaller pieces or units that are called hepatic, lobules, hepatic lobules. And in the hepatic, lobule will have a whole bunch of our hepatocytes or single liver cells that are hanging out sitting around here.  Surrounding these have had 0 sites, is going to be a representation of our portal Triad. That includes a branch that was part of the portal vein, a branch. That was a part of the hepatic artery and then a branch that will come together to make the common hepatic duct. So those three that make up your portal Triad. Now, this portal Triad isn't found in just one part of the hepatic, lobule. In fact, there's a bunch of them that surround the hip  It's and make this very familiar shape. You might recall from chemistry. So it's this six-sided ring. That makes up the hepatic lobule that has six units of the portal Triad surrounding the hepatocytes. And this is how we get nutrient-rich blood to enter into the hepatic lobule. So, that way, these a paddle sites. These liver cells can extract nutrients for the metabolism, or the storage of  Owls. And of course, have had 0 sites are just like any other cell in the body. They need oxygen to survive and so oxygen will be carried in from our proper hepatic artery.

Sinusoids the come off the portal vein, and finally after nutrients have been  Acted oxygen has been extracted and we need to send this Blood back into the paddock vain. All of the blood will collect at this very center right here. Very conveniently called the central vein. So the central vein that sits in the very middle of our hepatic lobule.

There was a suggested link between diabetes and migraine. It was simple. If you had diabetes, you're less likely to develop migraines. Diabetes is a lifelong condition with results in your blood. Glucose levels becoming too high glucose sugar and it affects approximately three point six million people in the UK alone. There are two types type 1 diabetes.  Geez, where your body's own immune system attack and destroy. The insulin-producing cells? Insulin is a hormone that is used to reduce your blood glucose levels. Type 2 is where your body either doesn't produce enough insulin or your body cells, don't respond to the insulin that is produced in both circumstances. It means your blood glucose levels are not reduced and that is life-threatening. A migraine is a reoccurring headache. That feels like a severe throbbing pain. On one side of your head symptoms also include nausea vomiting and an increase in sensitivity to light or  Sound effects approximately, 1, out of 5, women and 1 out of 15 men. Nowadays fact is based on work done by a positive Antunez. Oh, and his colleagues at the University of Bergen in Norway. So they looked at a drug prescription. Records of all in adults, under the age of 80, in Norway, over a 10-year period. So there were four point two million people in the study of these. 8001 been treated for type 1, diabetes and 93,000. People were being treated for type 2 diabetes. Then they look  looked at what portion of these then went on to get migraine medication compared to non diabetics. They're finding people with diabetes are less likely to develop migraine what they don't know yet. If it was a disease or the medication, that was reducing the occurrence of migraines. So, one of the side effects of diabetes is nerve ending damage, which causes a reduction in sensation in your hands and feet. And it's thought this may also affect your head. Therefore reducing your ability to actually sense, the migraines or the link could be.  In some people with migraines, they have a mutation in a gene that causes the production of a protein that is sensitive to the hormone insulin. So people who have this, mutation could be developing migraines as a result of abnormal insulin levels. So diabetics who are treating their Diabetes by normalizing. Their insulin levels would also reduce the occurrence of migraines. So what is the end result? The end result is more testing is needed. Should we change a diabetes medication? Can a variant of it, which doesn't affect your internet?  Was be given to people with migraines one. That doesn't affect your blood glucose levels, but reduces the occurrence of migraines.

If you are experiencing some of the symptoms of diabetes or have some risk factors, your doctor may choose to test and monitor you for diabetes or pre-diabetes, which is the precursor to type 2 diabetes. The first and most common test is a fasting blood sugar test. So, during a fasting blood sugar test. You don't have anything to eat for eight hours. And then you go to your doctor's office or laboratory and they draw tube of blood from your arm. And that's it. Another option that is infrequently, used is a glucose tolerance test. So during an oral glucose tolerance test, you don't have anything to eat for eight hours and then you go to your doctor's office or the laboratory. They draw tube of blood from your arm. And then they give you a sweet solution to drink, kind of like an orange soda. And after you drink that, you get your blood drawn an hour later. And two hours later, the third and the simplest diagnostic test is the hemoglobin A1c or A1C test. So an A1C test can also be used to diagnose diabetes. And that's just a simple tube of blood drawn from your arm. You don't have to fast. Do any kind of preparation for that test? If your doctor confirms you have diabetes, you may experience many different emotions and stress. According to the American Diabetes Association, how you perceive this diagnosis will greatly affect how successfully your diabetes is managed. Here are a few steps. They recommend first learned.  In to laugh, your thoughts and feelings have an enormous impact on your body. Positive thoughts, do have positive physical effects.

As the eggs mature, the follicles secrete estrogen, the main female sex hormone, once the amount of estrogen in the blood reaches a certain level.  The pituitary sends a surge of luteinizing hormone.  To the ovaries.  Causing the most mature, follicle to open and release its egg. In a process called ovulation, the free egg travels through the fallopian tube where it awaits fertilization.  Eventually, the remaining immature, follicles and eggs dissolve.  If the egg is not fertilized, the egg and the lining of the uterus are shed during the next menstrual period.  If you have polycystic ovary syndrome your pituitary gland, May release abnormally high amounts of luteinizing hormone into your bloodstream. Disrupting your normal menstrual cycle as a result, your follicles. Do not mature and ovulation does not occur which can lead to infertility some of the immature. Follicles. Do not dissolve and remain as fluid-filled sacs.  Or cysts.  In addition your doctor May find your blood has high levels of insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas.  Too much insulin combined with high levels of luteinizing hormone can lead to excess production of a male hormone called testosterone in your ovaries. Abnormally, high levels of testosterone, prevent ovulation, which can lead to infertility.  High levels of testosterone.

Because of excess insulin and insulin resistance heart disease, high blood pressure cholesterol abnormalities in the blood and endometrial cancer.  Since there is no cure for polycystic ovary syndrome, your doctor May recommend, one or more medications to treat your symptoms such as hormonal birth control. Which while preventing pregnancy also regulates your menstrual cycle and reduces testosterone production in your ovaries, anti-androgen medications, which reduce abnormal hair growth, and acne, diabetes medications, such as met.  Mormon, which lowers, your insulin levels and regulates your menstrual cycle and fertility medications which can stimulate ovulation, so you can become pregnant.  If you want to become pregnant and fertility medications, have not succeeded in restoring, ovulation, your doctor May recommend laparoscopic. Ovarian Drilling.  During the procedure, your surgeon will insert a small needle into the ovary and use an electric current to destroy small areas of ovarian tissue, where testosterone is produced.  Over time testosterone production diminishes and ovulation may occur.  Welcome to a very special episode of stuck in Vermont, brought to you by seven days. My name is Ava. Salzburger. I would you like to know what this is? Well, it's a melon. But it's also a proximally. The size of an ovarian cyst that was growing inside of me. I'm making this video to educate other women about ovarian.  When I found out that I had a gigantic Mass on my ovary. I didn't know the first thing about ovarian cyst since then, almost every woman. I've talked to his either had one themselves or, they know their mothers or their sisters, or even themselves had had experiences with ovarian cysts. Think there's a stigma related to women talking about any of their reproductive organs. Just became aware of how common it was. But yet, it seems like this secret. What is it, about, ovarian cysts? Why do they even exist at all? Was there something wrong?  Me and how do you know if this fist is turning into ovarian cancer? If you have a cyst as just completely a balloon full of water with no lumps and bumps in their majority of the time? If not close to 100% of time. It is not cancer. That may be not be something that you need to worry about and some of them are functional. For example, when you ovulate once a month, you can have a cystic develops. No woman should ever feel that just because I have a cyst on ovary that they are Congo abnormal.  Fifth happen. This important for you to be educated about the steps that you need to take if a cyst happens to you. So I went to my doctor and I said, I really have a feeling something is going on in my body and she said, no, you're fine. So months later in June. I woke up one morning to intense excruciating pain. In the left side of my abdomen. I was nauseous. I was sweating. I felt like I was going to  Without any second, they tested around my abdomen of, for signs of a ruptured cyst or a ruptured appendix and neither one seemed to be the case. So, for $1200, I left the, ER, with no diagnosis whatsoever on and off, in the following weeks. I had intermittent pain and the only thing that saved me during that time was this my hot water bottle. I've drowned with this fish in my pants for weeks. So after three pelvic exams, which turned up  Up, nothing. I eventually did get an ultrasound and that was only because the pain was not going away. So after I had the ultrasound, I found out from my doctor that it had a large mass on my ovary. They thought it was my right ovary. But I knew deep inside that it was my left ovary. They decided this was not a simple cyst. This was a complex cyst. I know, I had something big growing inside of me, and I knew that it could be cancerous. When we say, someone has a complex.  It means that that ovary has a system component. There is a fluid component to it. And there's a complex, which is a solid component. So, complex. Cystic masks are the ones that are little bit more concerning. So I went into the, ER, and initially the thought was that, they they thought I was having an appendicitis. It kind of felt like an afterthought that they thought, maybe it would be an ovarian cyst and I was taken to have an ultrasound ding ding, you know, it's no very insist from the scar tissue. They told me it was probably about the size of a clementine.  Tine which just was shocking to me that I could have something that large inside my body and not know. So this is like a balloon filled with water and at some point it's going to get weak. So it leaks but no one really knows why a cyst will rupture and sometimes assist will rupture and then the body will heal over that little rupture. So this this will continue to grow again. When I was in college. I had a cyst on my ovary and it bursts, the pain was so intense that I went to the emergency room. The reason that my stomach was swelling with, in fact, because of the  It's that were inside of the cyst in laparoscopy. We are operating with a telescope and we're looking at TV screens. It's like operating with chopsticks because your hands are out here. The belly is in the middle. Your fingers are manipulating instruments. The DaVinci assisted laparoscopy. We have 3D Vision. I am able to move the arms of my instruments, much better we can do it. They call Uncle Ole Fashioned way, where we make an incision on your belly. This was 21 years ago. She said I have found quite a large mass in your abdomen.  Woman. It's about the size of a grapefruit in those days. It was major surgery. I was in the hospital for three days that long incision Cuts, all the abdominal muscles longest recovery. It was three months and sure enough after the surgery. That's the first thing they tell you. Yes, it's benign. It's not cancer. Of course. That was a big relief. So in August, dr. Wong performed at DaVinci. Assisted laparoscopy on. Luckily, for me. It's a relatively non-invasive.  Surgery, they only do five small incisions and the recovery time is pretty fast. Actually had to sign a piece of paper before I went into surgery saying that dr. Wong could take everything out of me wrong. You know, you're gonna wake up with nothing left down there. So what you're looking at now is the inside of me. That's right. That's what I look like in there. So when dr. Wong cut me open, he found out that this gigantic tumor had twisted. My left fallopian tube. And guess what?  But I was right. It was on my left side. It turns out that I have endometriosis. That means it's a chocolate sis. When you cut it open, it looks like chocolate only not as tasting my life fallopian to my left ovary and the gigantic cystic mass were all removed. They were drained of their fluid put in a plastic bag and then sucked through my belly button. Buh, buh. I could say that I miss you.  When I woke up from surgery. The first thing dr. Wong said to me is you don't have cancer. Patient wants 100% diagnosis of whether or not they have cancer or not. The only way that you can do it is by surgery. So we would take out an ovary or portion of the ovary send it to the pathologist and they'll do a biopsy on it. And tell us, no one knows. What is the cause of ovarian cancer? Because majority of the women who have ovarian cancer have known.  No family history. No risk factors. I have patients who eat healthy exercise. You don't smoke, don't drink and you know, very very athletic and they still develop ovarian cancer. So no one really knows.\",\n",

       " 'yL81Ls3ys': 'A biological individual consists of multiple organs with specialized functions for the organism to function properly in its environment. These organs must communicate this communication often involves a signal sent from one location to another that instructs. The second organ about the status of some cellular feature. Glucose is a good example, glucose is a critical product of digestion. it is an essential energy source for cellular metabolism this energy is produced when glucose is used as a substrate for glycolysis and the Krebs or citric acid cycle following the digestion of food higher levels of glucose circulate through the bloodstream where it enters different cell types  in muscle cells glucose is readily used to produce energy and is also stored as glycogen a secondary short-term energy source  In fat cells. Glucose is used for triglyceride production and acts as an important energy. Reserve molecule.  Here, we will illustrate the signaling pathway that occurs when glucose is at high levels. This pathway involves multiple proteins and signaling events. This is termed. Cytoplasmic signaling. Different types of cells, perform similar signaling steps in response to changes in their environment.  In the protein recycling animation. We see a group of storage, vesicles enriched with glute for proteins, continuously recycling from the cell membrane to an inactive location. In the cytosol glute for is a protein that facilitates the movement of glucose into the cell.  When high levels of glucose are detected by beta cells in the pancreas, insulin is released by the cells, the insulin circulates through the bloodstream until it binds to an insulin receptor embedded, in the cell membrane of a muscle fat or brain cell. Once the insulin binds to the receptor, phosphate groups are added to the intracellular domain of the receptor.  Since the receptor itself, adds the phosphate groups. The process is called Auto. Phosphorylation this, phosphorylation event sets off, a Cascade of molecular events, the activated receptor protein, then adds a phosphate group to another closely associated protein. This effectively passes, the signal from the receptor to the next step in the signal pathway.  Proteins, that add phosphate groups to another protein are called kinases, kinases are often components of signal Pathways and phosphorylation is an important component in the transmission of a signal, from one compartment to another. In this system. The signal corresponds to the level of blood glucose and is transmitted from outside to inside the cell.  Next, we see a large pool of molecules that are embedded in the membrane. Also being phosphorylated, other proteins are then. In turn phosphorylated. Further transmitting the first extracellular signal that was originally sent from outside the cell membrane.  So, how does this affect the uptake of glucose? As we mentioned before glute for is a glucose transporter and glute for storage. Vesicles are held in a recycling State near the cell membrane. The vesicles are held mostly in this region because the RAB proteins that interact with the motor proteins, necessary to move the vesicles to the membrane are in an inactive state.  A final step in this signal pathway, involves the phosphorylation of a protein that prevents the RAB proteins from interacting with the vesicles.  When the rap proteins are no longer inhibited, the storage, vesicles can freely merge with the membrane.  Once the vesicles have merged many glute for proteins, are embedded in the membrane and large quantities of glucose, can move into the cell.  It is the signaling pathway that ensures only the correct molecules will be allowed to enter the target cell.',\n",

The three most essential functions are producing bile to Aid digestion, cleansing, harmful toxins from the blood and storing glucose to fulfill the body's energy needs. If you have multiple signs and Symptoms of this problem. Ask your doctor to check your health levels. Here are the 10 early signs of liver damage.  One yellowing of skin. One of the early signs of liver damage is jaundice or yellowing of the skin eyes tongue, and fingernails, or fingertips is noticeable. Jaundice is caused by a buildup of bilirubin in the blood and body tissue. That the liver normally would get rid of along with old red blood cells. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is formed by the breakdown of dead, red blood cells in the liver, when bilirubin accumulates in your bloodstream and then on your skin, it takes on a yellowish hue.  Has jaundice may also indicate a serious problem with your gallbladder or pancreas. Do not take it lightly and follow your doctor's advice to digestive issues. The liver plays an active role in the digestion process through the production of bile, bile helps process. The nutrients absorbed from the small intestine and plays an important role in digesting fat. Thus, if the liver begins to malfunction, it can result in digestive problems like diarrhea and in digestion.  Abnormalities in bile production can also lead to gallstones abdominal. Bloating, constipation irritable bowel syndrome and intolerance to fatty foods and alcohol. When the damage is severe, it can cause severe abdominal pain that often sends people to the doctor three, nausea, and vomiting many people, ignore nausea and vomiting as it is, usually not considered to be a serious medical problem. If nausea and vomiting occur separately or together without any  Known reason, such as motion sickness, dizziness a migraine food poisoning early, pregnancy, anxiety, and depression. It can be due to a kidney or liver problem. People suffering from liver damage, often have a persistent feeling of nausea. This arises due to the livers, diminished ability to process and eliminate toxins changes in metabolism and digestion, also, cause nausea and vomiting constant feelings of nausea or vomiting can  Havoc on your health and should be investigated thoroughly by dr. For changes in stool color changes in stool color changes in stool color, may also indicate liver trouble a well functioning liver releases bile into the stool, giving it the normal brown color inflammation or scarring in the liver effects.

It occurs frequently consult a doctor to rule out the possibility of liver damage or any other illness. Five changes in the urine color. If you are drinking enough fluid and your urine has a darker color. It may be an indication of a liver problem. Dark colored urine can look, orange, Amber or brown. The change in urine, color occurs due to an increased level of bilirubin. In the blood stream, this happens when the liver is unable to eliminate bilirubin via excretion through the kidneys.

       " 'Of1Aewx-zRM': \"No, because these lipids are insoluble in blood plasma, they have to be transported throughout the body in a protein, capsule known as lipoprotein.  Lipo proteins, consist of a hydrophobic core made of cholesterol and triglycerides. Surrounded by hydrophilic shell made of phospholipids and a polite bow proteins.  These a polite bow proteins, are specialized proteins that can control enzymes in lipoprotein, metabolism and serve, as ligands for lipoprotein receptors.  Now, depending on the variation in lipid and Abel Abel protein composition, as well as their density lipoproteins, can be divided into four major types. That is chylomicrons.  Very low density lipoprotein. Vldl for short.  Low, density lipoprotein, LDL for short, and high-density lipoprotein HDL for short.  Now, chylomicrons are produced in the gut from dietary lipids and are composed mostly of triglycerides. And belatedly small amount of cholesterol.  Next vldls are produced in the liver and are composed primarily of triglycerides and some cholesterol and amount relatively larger in comparison to chylomicrons.  Now the function of these two lipoproteins is to deliver energy rich triglycerides to cells throughout the body. Once they are secreted into the blood stream, the enzyme located on the capillary walls called lipoprotein lipase. Releases the fatty acids, which are then taken up by the tissues.  That's the triglyceride content decreases. The vldl gets transformed into LDL, which now contains relatively higher percentage of cholesterol. The function of LDL is simply to deliver this cholesterol to cells where it's used for cell membrane and synthesis of steroid hormones.  However, more than half of the circulating. LDL is, eventually taken up by the liver, which uses cholesterol to synthesize bile acids.  And, as you may already know about assets are necessary for normal digestion, and absorption of fats and fat soluble vitamins in the small intestine.  Lastly excess cholesterol from the peripheral cells is transported back to the liver by HDL. HDL is composed mainly of protein with small amount of lipids and it is produced in the liver and small intestine. Now, the problem arises when we have abnormally high levels of LDL cholesterol, which can accumulate in the innermost layer of the artery wall and lead to formation of a Terrace quadratic lesions.  This is why L DL is often referred to as bad cholesterol.  Now, HDL on the other hand, prevents formation of atherosclerosis, lesions by removing cholesterol, as well as suppressing LDL oxidation and Vascular information. This is why HDL is often referred to, as a good cholesterol. So abnormally, low levels of it can also contribute to atherosclerosis.  Now, there are several major classes of lipid-lowering drugs. So first, we have hmg-coa reductase Inhibitors. Commonly known as status in order to better understand how these agents work. We need to take a closer look at the liver cell.  This is where agent. Jiko. A reductase enzyme, converts hmg-coa into mevalonic acid, which is a cholesterol precursor. This is a rate limiting step. So by inhibiting this enzyme statins effectively reduced concentration of cholesterol, wouldn't deliver cell.  Now liver cells sense. The reduced levels of cholesterol production and begin to compensate by synthesizing, more LDL receptors, which in turn, bind and internalized, LDL that's circulating in the blood.  Additionally, low intracellular cholesterol levels lead, to decrease, secretion of vldl, which also contributes to lowering of triglyceride levels.  Lastly, statins, may also increase HDL levels by few different mechanisms that are still being investigated.  Example of drugs that belong to this class are atorvastatin Fluval, Statin Lovastatin, pravastatin rosuvastatin and Simvastatin.  Now, when it comes to side effects because statins are metabolized in the liver. They may Elevate liver, enzymes, and thus increased risk of liver toxicity in susceptible patients.  Secondly, use of statins has been associated with muscle related problems or myopathy and in rare cases Rhabdomyolysis that is destruction of skeletal muscle. The mechanism behind that is still being investigated. However, it is thought to be related to the inhibition of mevalonate production, which happens to be essential precursor to other compounds that are important to maintain the Integrity of muscle cells.  Now, let's move on to the next group of lipid-lowering drugs, which includes only one agent that is nicotinic acid. Commonly known as niacin.  So unlike statins, nice and works in adipose tissue, where did inhibits an enzyme called hormone sensitive lipase, which was responsible for breakdown of triglycerides, to free fatty acids.  Now, normally liver uses, these three fatty acids to make its own triglycerides, which then become important component of vldl. So by reducing levels of free fatty acids available for transport to the liver niacin, effectively decreases hepatic vldl synthesis, which in turn leads to decreased levels of LDL.  Furthermore niacin increases HDL levels by few different mechanisms that are still being investigated.  Now, when it comes to side effects, one of the most, common one is Flushing caused by niacin induced prostaglandin release which results in cutaneous vasodilation.  Next niacin can compete with uric acid for excretion by the kidneys, which can increase risk of hyperuricemia and gout, lastly, at large enough doses. Niacin may also cause liver toxicity.  Now, let's move on to another group of lipid-lowering drugs, that is fibrates. So fibrates work primarily by activating nuclear transcription. Receptor called peroxisome proliferator, activated receptor alpha, or ppar Alpha for short PBA. Our Alpha is found in metabolically active, tissues, such as liver and adipose tissue.  The Binding of fibrates to ppar often induces activation or inhibition of certain genes that code for proteins involved in lipid metabolism.  One of the main effects induced by fibrates is increased expression of lipoprotein lipase, which in turn increases, the removal of triglycerides from circulation and their breakdown to fatty acids.  Furthermore fibrates decrease expression of protein called a posse 3 which inhibits lipoprotein lipase activity.  And lastly, vibrates also increase expression of proteins 8.1 and able a to which are major component of HDL, thus leading to increase in its concentrations.  Drugs. Don't belong to this class include Fino, vibrate and Gem febrile cell.  Now, when it comes to side effects, the most common ones are GI disturbances. Additionally, just like with statins myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis have been reported particularly in patients with impaired renal function. The precise mechanism of Maya toxicities, still yet to be determined. However, it is thought to be multifactorial.  Lastly, because fibrates increase the cholesterol content of bile. They can increase risk of gallstones formation.  Now, let's move on to the next group of lipid-lowering drugs. That is bile acid sequestrants. So as you already know, bile acids are produced in the liver stored in the gallbladder and are excreted into the God where they facilitate digestion, absorption of lipids.  Now, bile acid sequestrants basically serve as an ion exchange resins, that by negatively charged bile acids and salts in the small intestine, the formation of this insoluble complex prevents the reabsorption of bile acids, and thus leads to their excretion.  This increase in bile acid, excretion in turn, creates increased demand for their production.  Since bile acids are made from cholesterol liver cells increase. Their number of LDL receptors to bring in more LDL cholesterol in order to meet this new demand.  So the end result is decreased levels of circulating L DL.  Example of drugs that belong to this class are called several mm, cholesterol and cholestyramine.  Now side effects are limited to the GI tract. So bloating indigestion, constipation. Nausea are quite common. Additionally. This agents May decrease absorption of fat soluble vitamins, and they also have potential to form insoluble complexes with other drugs, thus interfering with their absorption.  Now, let's move on to another group of lipid-lowering drugs, that is cholesterol absorption inhibitors.  In order to understand how costs are absorption, inhibitor works. It's important to understand the basic mechanism of cholesterol absorption in small intestine.  So free cholesterol that comes either from bile or dietary sources. First, binds to protein abbreviated NPC 1, l 1, which is located in the plasma membrane of cells known as enterocyte. Stud line. Do intestinal walls.  This binding then triggers endocytosis which utilizes protein complex called clattering ap2 that works on the cell membrane, to internalize the cholesterol cargo.  Upon endocytosis, the cholesterol is released and the NPC 1 l 1 returns back to the plasma membrane.  Now the cholesterol absorption inhibitor, simply binds to NPC 101 and inhibits, its ability to interact with clathrin ap2, complex that is necessary for endocytosis. This leads to decrease delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the\",\n",

       " 'O69i7fHc': \"Hello, I'm Tom Mason of the diabetes, Council.com researcher writer and I have type 2 diabetes. Today. I want to talk to you about diabetes reversal after you watch the video. Today. I invite you to check out the description box for my new ebook. This is one of the most comprehensive diabetes meal planning book. You can find it contains, diabetes friendly meals and recipes recipes for different goals, such as 800 or 1800 calories per day meal plan. And Diabetes Meal planning tips and tricks but also tons of diabetes friendly recipes for everyone. Now, let me Begin by saying categorically that at the time of this video, there is no cure for diabetes. There are literally thousands of claims out there saying their product or their program, can cure your diabetes, simply put they cannot  But this question, I asked if diabetes can be reversed. So, to begin this conversation, we need to Define what we mean by reversed. Now, if we are saying we can take our bodies back to the time before we had diabetes, the note, if we are talking about a state in which we can control our blood sugar without the use of any medications. The answer is maybe now let's talk about those with type 1 diabetes. First. If you have type 1 diabetes, then you are insulin-dependent when you were first diagnosed.  You may have gone through what is called, a honeymoon period in which, your blood sugar kept dropping and dropping, and you use less and less insulin. You may have even stopped using it all together by the way researchers. Now, feel that type ones need to continue small injections of insulin to protect what insulin-producing cells. They do have even during that honeymoon, period but this honeymoon period will not last forever. If you have type 1, diabetes in approximately 90 percent of your insulin producing cells have been destroyed.  They've not been damaged with a Chance of repair. They are gone. It is impossible to reverse the Damage Done while some think their diabetes has been cured or even reversed. This is a false sense of security. The process that destroyed the 90% of insulin producing cells will destroy the remaining. 10%, Ultimately, you'll be totally dependent on the insulin type 1. Diabetes cannot be reversed. As a matter of fact that used to be called insulin dependent diabetes. And this is not just my opinion, is the opinion.  Of the four, most diabetes center in the world. The Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston.  As far as type 2 diabetes. Well, as long as we are clear on the definition of reversal, I will say it's possible. Remember I'm adamant about the fact that there is no cure for diabetes, but I do feel it's possible for a person with type 2 to be able to go off their diabetes meds for a time and control their blood sugar. That would be a reversal. We cannot go back and reverse the Damage Done by having diabetes, but it is possible to control diabetes without medication the most recent  Research I could find on the subject was conducted in March of 2016. It was conducted by Professor Roy Taylor professor of medicine and Metabolism at Newcastle University in Newcastle England. Now the work was an extension of a 2011 study that was in question because of the brevity of the study that study. Had a theory that quote, This research is part of a growing body of evidence showing that people with type 2, diabetes, who successfully lose weight can.  Verse their condition because fat is removed from their pancreas returning, insulin production to normal. Now in 2016 30 volunteers with type 2, diabetes went on a strict diet of 650 calories per day for six months. Now, let me tell you right now, that's not a lot of food for 650 calories. However, the participants lost an average of 30 pounds. Now, they had to keep this weight off for another six months.  The results were that of the 3012 that had type 2. Who had been diagnosed less than 10 years, did reverse their diabetes. For those who have been diagnosed longer. They did not have the same result. The key to reversing diabetes is to lose weight and have regular exercise. In another study discussed by Michael danzinger. MD those with type 2 exercise for 175 minutes. A week, limited their calories to twelve to eighteen hundred per day.  And got weekly counseling and education on these lifestyle changes within a year. 10% got off their diabetes medication or improved to the point where their blood sugar level was no longer in the diabetes range, but classified as pre-diabetes in every study. I researched. It was apparent that the numbers of those who were able to reverse, their diabetes were largely dependent on the date of diagnosis. Those who were newbies had a better chance of reversal.  But even at that, the average of those who have been able to reverse, their diabetes has been about 10% weight loss and exercise will not work for everyone. Part of the reason that some people have diabetes simply is it, they're predisposed to it. It's in their genes. The reason we also call this a reversal rather than a cure for those who have experienced reversal and then gain their weight back. Guess what happens?  Well, they start their diabetes meds again, I can attest to this firsthand. I was a 400-pound man at one point. I was in terrible shape and more ways than what I dropped. 185 pounds on a fad diet. It was great. I no longer needed any diabetes, meds. I felt pretty good and this went on for about three years, but when that died, I was on started affecting other parts of my body. I got very sick. I was told I had to stop that fad diet and try to reach  Turn to a normal diet or something. Very bad was going to happen. To me. When I went off that fat diet. I gained 100 pounds in no time at all. I had to go back on my diabetes meds now, since then, I've lost 60 pounds through diet and exercise eating sensibly, but I still have diabetes and I still take diabetes meds. Did I reverse my diabetes for a time? Yes, I did. Is it possible to keep diabetes in reversal mode? Sure, but don't fall for these gimmick programs.  It promised to cure or even reverse your diabetes, scientific research says it is possible but not with the field or a potion. It's possible through hard work of maintaining your diet and getting plenty of exercise. If you want to start a plan to begin a process that will hopefully reverse your diabetes. The first place to go is to see your healthcare provider. They will have safe plans for you to try if you need further assistance. My ebook has a lots of great ideas for those who want to begin this process. You  Find a download for it in the description box below. I hope this has answered your question. Concerning diabetes being reversed. Don't forget to get my new e-book and please subscribe to our channel for more videos like this one in the future. Thanks so much for watching.

       " 'FVbsiwEk': \"Welcome to this introduction to the skill of reading blood pressure. There are many parts to the skill of taking a blood pressure. This video is focused on learning to read the gauge. You will listen to several blood pressure readings and you will then record your reading. So, you will need some paper and a pen or pencil. The instrument used is called a sphygmomanometer. You will be able to say this word. It takes a bit of practice. A manometer is a device that measures pressure fig which rhymes with fig relates to blood broken into its parts. It is sphygmomanometer.  The skill, we are practicing is to coordinate. What you hear with what you see on the gauge. You will listen for the first sound, which is the systolic blood pressure next. Listen for when the sound stops. This is the diastolic blood pressure. Then write down your measurement. Every measurement has a unit. That is part of recording the reading for blood pressure.  The unit of measurement is mmhg. This stands for millimeters of Mercury, Hg is the chemical symbol for mercury, even though Mercury is rarely used in blood pressure devices today. This Remains the traditional unit of measure when recording the blood pressure measurement, right? Down to numbers as a fraction. The top number.  It's the systolic blood pressure when the heart contracts with full force. The bottom number is the diastolic blood pressure when the heart rests and refills. Also write down the unit. Mmhg on a sphygmomanometer gauge, each Mark or Line Stands for a unit of to. There are no odd numbers on this gauge.  No matter what you measure, you can only read what the units allow round up or down, but don't make up numbers that are not on the scale. These longer marks, indicate units of 10. There is not space on the gauge to write all the numbers. Look at where 80 is marked and we're 100 is marked the long line in between indicates 90.  You can see that the numbers 100, 120 140 are written on the gauge. The unnumbered long lines indicate 110 130 150 between the marked numbers, the short lines, all equal to look at 100 and 120. The long line in between is 110 and the short lines.  Cool, 102, 104, 106 108 the long line. 110, Short Line, 112 114, 116 118 Long Line. 120. What do you think? The number is just one line under 140?  If your answer is 138 then you are correct. Now, let's look at the markings as the needle goes down the gauge. Let's start at 150.  What number is the needle pointing to now?  It's indicating 138.  Now, the needle is pointing at 110.  Where is the needle pointing now?  It is indicating 68. Now, for the moment you've been waiting for, these sounds are from a simulator arm and do not sound the same as a real person's blood pressure. But the idea is to listen for the sounds and Mark where you hear the first sound, and the sound stopping.  We will listen to six different blood pressures and pause between each to give you time to record your measurement.  After all six blood pressures have played, the answers will be shown.  Here we go.  You have now heard six different blood pressure, readings and recorded your measurement. Here are the answers to blood pressures, 1 2 and 3. And here are the answers to blood pressures, four, five, and six. Did you all come within plus or minus four millimeters Mercury with your readings compared to the answers?  That is the standard for accuracy, for our course, for this skill of measuring blood pressure.  After some practice, you will come within two millimeters, Mercury compared to another person, listening with you to the same blood pressure. You were not born knowing how to do this. It takes practice. Now, one more time. Everyone say sphygmomanometer. Thank you all for participating in this exercise. I hope it was helpful.  Please contact your instructor if you have any questions.\",\n",

       " 'OMn8Tq5Eyao': \"Hi, I'm dr. Mike Evans. And today we're talking about the importance of intensity in physical activity. The stuff that gets your heart pumping to meet Ken is physical activity, guidelines? You need to do at least 150 minutes weekly of something called mvpa. So mvpa stands for moderate to vigorous physical activity. So why is this important? Well, I guess in our lives. We want to invest in simple actions and improve. Many things exercise. Does this from reducing heart disease or cancer?  Cancer to improving mental health. Simply improving the quality of Our Lives. Often get asked. What is the best exercise? And my number one answer is definitely the one you'll do. But my second answer is one possible. Do an exercise requires more effort or that is higher intensity. The higher the intensity the healthier the results why? Well research has shown that higher intensity. Activities are more effective than lower intensity activities at improving our health, especially when it comes to the important stuff like reducing your risk for heart.  Disease, but what is intensity? I think intensity can be thought of as how hard a person Works to do a specific activity. It's important to remember that, no two people are the same. So the intensity of different forms of physical activity varies between people and depends on someone's previous exercise experience and their level of Fitness. If you're an active, any amount of physical activity can provide some health benefits, so, it's best to start with smaller amounts of activity, and gradually increase duration, frequency and intensity.  So how do we measure intensity? Well, we use something called a mat. So that's a metabolic equivalent. So the high-end running might be 1/8 jogging A5 and at the bottom would be resting or watching TV, which would be anything less than 1.5 moderate intensity. Physical activity which measures three to six minutes requires effort and noticeably accelerates your heart rate. So for example walking depending on your speed the Met could range from 2 point 3, 2 3, .6 yard.  Work could be a six housework can be 3 to 3.5 and so on vigorous-intensity physical activity which measures more than six minutes, requires a large amount of effort and causes rapid breathing in a substantial, increase in your heart rate, think of sports or shoveling heavy snow. It's difficult to sustain vigorous activity for a long time. One way to think about this is to reflect on the research on athletes. So for example cycling really, really hard for 30 to 60 seconds and then relaxing for the same amount of  Time. And then repeating, what we call interval training has been shown to improve performance in a shorter amount of time. The same can be true for the average person. Incorporate in short periods of increased, intensity into your routine, can improve your Fitness and decrease your risk of a long list of Health complications. Still a little unclear. Let's make it even simpler. If an activity doesn't cause changes in your breathing patterns or make you sweat. Then you're probably getting a low intensity workout. If you can hold a conversation, but still feel out of breath. You're probably in the  moderate range. If you can't talk to your neighbor or sing out loud, you're probably in the vigorous range. If you can do moderate to vigorous activity at least 150 minutes per week. You meeting the target? So, go for a brisk. Walk, grab a dance partner, a garden hoe, or even a vacuum cleaner, and get ready, get set, and up, and go. That's all for now. Thanks for listening.\",\n",
       " 'zg7j3qpEY': \"Hey guys. I'm here in Mexico at the beach and I thought I would make a video about having an insulin pump at the beach because I found this week to be very challenging. Having a pump on me. I thought I would give a little video to show you what I'm doing to make things a bit easier. I think having an implant pump at the beach really sucks. And this is why I. So the first thing I find challenging is that it's really hard to clip it to your bathing suit, especially if you're a girl because there's Not much there to clip it. To usually, you walk around with your pump site out and your pop showing that you get a lot of stairs to get, a lot of people. Looking at you thinking. Oh, what's wrong with her? What kind of medical condition does she have? Another thing is that if your pump isn't waterproof, it's really hard. If you're going in and out of the Monarch, not to mention, you have to protect it from dust. And lastly. It's really hot here. So you have to protect your pump from Nate because if your pump gets too hot, the insulin will get too hot.  It will stop working. I'm going to go through how I deal with these challenges of having an influence. The first problem is with where to cook your palm. I find when I buy my bathing suit, I like to pick one. That has a pretty sturdy strap at the bottom. Nothing too stringy. Or I'll still put your pump to your bathing suit and your bathing suit will fall down. So I try to pick the bathing suit that I can put my pop to and I know it will stay on without pulling the bottom step.  Another thing. I find really annoying. When you're walking around here. You get a lot of stares. Inquisitive looks like, what is that heart monitor? Nobody really knows what it is. My advice is just don't care. I know it's easier said than done. I've learned over the years to really embrace the fact that I have type 1 diabetes and to not be shy about it. Nobody's business really, and just wear it and flaunt it and go fishing.  Give it what I do with my palm on the beach. Really depends on what kind of activity I'm doing. If I'm just going for a walk on the beach. I'll have my pump Clips maybe soup. If I'm just sitting in my chair like this on the beach. I'll put my contact in a protective case and then put it under my towel. If I'm going to go swimming. I just connect my cock. I put it in this case which is slightly inflated. It protects the pump from heating up a lot. I will put it in my beach bag.  And I make sure to put my beach bag in the shade so that it doesn't get hot either. I want to take a break from my pocket and say take it off for about an hour. I'll check my blood sugar. Make sure that my blood sugar is a good number. Then I will give myself a bolus of what I would normally receive within an hour from my Faisal rate. And then after an hour of having my pop off, I check again, to make sure that my blood sugar is still fine, and I'll either reconnect or  Stay disconnected, but it's all about keeping an eye on your blood sugar. While your pump is off to make sure it doesn't arrive and giving yourself the appropriate amount of influence. Okay? So the last thing I need to address is keeping your pump cool because it is really hot here. I've been using this case. It's what I got with my pump. It's kind of insulating. It makes it so that my pump doesn't get too warm, but  Italy doesn't keep it cool. So I would suggest getting a free. Okay, so you can get them online. I know a lot of people have these. It keeps your Popsicle. When you're at the beach or, and any hot climate. I know I'll be purchasing one when I get home because I think my pump has gotten to where I'm on the beach here in Mexico. One thing. I haven't quite figured out yet. Is how did you water sports with an insulin? Pump is not waterproof. So I can't take it with me. If any of you have ever done any sort of person.  Going kayaking any sort of water sports. Please. Let me know in the comments down below. How you have done that with an insulin pump. I would really appreciate it. So for my next insulin pump, I'm definitely going to get a waterproof one. Just so it's easier to do any sort of water sport. I feel like you also have to be less careful with the waterproof insulin pump. And with the one I have, now, you're still able to have a good beach vacation with type 1, diabetes.  So, if any of you are going on vacation soon, I hope you find this helpful and you're able to enjoy your time. Thanks again for watching.\",\n",

He wanted objective measurements the most famous of which were so-called. I grounds photographs taken with a special camera that allowed one to visualize the back of the eye and in doing so, he proved that. Now, I could die arrest, the bleeding losing, and swelling. You can see in the back of the eye of people with severe kidney hypertensive or heart disease, but actually Reverse it, something never even thought possible. Here's the before. Here's the after reversal to such a degree that even patients who could no longer distinguish. Any objects have been able to read fine print a reversal of blindness with diet.  The results were so dramatic that the head of the Department of Ophthalmology at Duke where Kempner worked was questioned as to, whether they were somehow faked. He assured them that they were not. In fact, he wrote in one person's chart. This patients. I grounds are improved to an unbelievable degree. Now. I had never seen anything like it. He doesn't even remember ever seeing a patient with such Advanced disease, even being alive 15 months later.  The magnitude of the improvements Kempner. Got were surprising reversal of end stage, heart, and kidney failure, simply beyond belief, but his Kempner said as is closing sentence of a presentation. For the American College of Physicians. The important result is not that the change in the course of the disease has been achieved by the rice diet, but that the course of the disease can be changed at all.  Now that we have high blood pressure drugs. We see less hypertensive retinopathy, but still a lot of diabetic retinopathy the leading cause of blindness in American adults, even with intensive diabetes treatment, at least three, insulin, injections, a day with a best modern technology has to offer like these implantable, insulin pumps. The best. We can offer is usually just a slowing of the progression of the disease, so we can. And the  Century, slow down your blindness but a half a century ago. Camping approved. You could reverse it. Kempner started out using his plant-based ultra low sodium fat, cholesterol, protein, rice diet to reverse, kidney and heart failure, but assumed it would make diabetes worse. He expected a 90%, carbohydrate diet would increase insulin requirements. However, the opposite proved to be true.  He just took the next hundred patients with diabetes and walk through his door, that went on the rice, die for at least three months and their fasting blood sugars. Dropped despite a drop in the amount of insulin. They were taking, but this is what blew people away. 44 of the patients had diabetic retinopathy and in thirty percent of the cases, their eyes improved.  From like this to this, that's not supposed to happen, diabetic. Retinopathy is be considered a sign of irreversible destruction. What does this mean in real life? Unable to even read headlines to normal vision?  The remarkable success. Dr. Kempner had reversing some of the most dreaded complications of diabetes with his rice and fruit diet, was not because of weight loss. The improvements occurred. Even in those patients that did not lose significant weight. So must have been something specific about the diet. Maybe it was, his total elimination of animal protein. Total elimination of animal fat, total elimination of cholesterol or radical reduction in sodium fat and protein in general General. We don't know.  But how do we treat diabetic, retinopathy these days with steroids and Other Drugs, injected straight into your eyeballs. And if that doesn't work, there's pan retinal laser photocoagulation in which laser burns are etched over. Nearly your entire retina surgeons. Literally burn out the back of your eye. Why would they do that? The theory is that by killing off?  Most of the retina, the little pieces you leave behind may get more of the blood flow.  When I See This along with kepner's work, I can't help but feel like history has been reversed. Like yeah, can you believe 50 years ago?

My accuracy is really good for up to about two-and-a-half to three weeks. And I've also never got an infection from my Dexcom Center. However, it's a choice that you have to make for yourself. I'm just going to show you two tips on what I do. What I put my Dexcom in, that helps my sensor last for almost three weeks. Yes. I have two left score. I thought I only had one left and I was like dreading ordering another box and paying the money. So, I'm about to do my desktop site. Tip. Number one is,  The preparation. So, I use these. They are called skin prep. You can get them on Amazon. I know, I just get them at the drugstore. They clean your skin, and they also leave a very thin ski film. So, I'm just gonna rub this adhesive over my arm. I'm not going to show you how to put your desk Clump in. I can always do another video on that with speed this up a bit.  Okay, it's all in and as you can see, I had to get myself into some awkward configurations. There. My boyfriend's, not here right now and he usually helps out a bit, but I'm able to do it on my own. I just have to be resourceful at my next one is all in. I have the transmitter in the sensor. First up, we did was preparation in prep. Second. Step is putting on some protective layer over top of the site. I use ivy.  Thousand. It's super easy to put on. Can also buy it on Amazon and I just get mine at my drugstore. This is how I prepared. It comes like a little sheet. And all you have to do is cut a hole in the Middle where your next comes gonna go. I have traced out this little piece of paper. It says, Dexcom on it so that I don't lose it and I remember what it's for. I take this I usually put it on top center right? In the middle, a trace over it. How did I get this? All you do?  Is you take your transmitter, put it over top of a piece of paper or a piece of cardboard and Trace around it with a little bit of a margin. Now, I have it all to Stout, but fold it in half and make my first initial cut like a little cut like this. You like. I'm doing a craft show, start cutting around the Border. There are different steps with this. It's all labeled. So on the inside you'll see it says number one. That's the one. You take off first, pull that off. Boom. Number two. We take that off. Now, we're going to put this on.  So you overlay it number three, you pull up this little piece of paper at the best and press that down for pull off the top layer like this. And there I have my protective IV 3000 over top of my sight. This layer last for about a week. It will start kind of peeling at the edges. So I just take it off. It comes off so easily and it doesn't pull off the desktop site itself and  And then I just put on another one and I replace it the center stays on. So, well, it never comes off anymore. The only reason I have to stop using my sensor is because I stopped getting blood sugar's on my desk calm and I just get question marks instead, and if you watched my last video of my birthday, which you all should, I'll link it in the description. You'll see that I was at three weeks for my desk calm and always giving you is question, mark, just remember my two tricks are to crap and then keep changing.  Get the IV tape over top of the center about once a week, and then you should have sensors that last you for as long as you would like to use them for. Thanks a lot for watching guys, and I will see you next time. Bye.\",\n",

Not responding. Well, all of those problems.  Make me feel like I should do something about it, that there was something really not, right. So I went to a doctor, the third doctor that I saw.  Diagnosed me in his waiting room. Basically just came up to me and said, come with me, sat me down in his office and looked at me and said, you have a brain tumor and that was how I was diagnosed after the surgery. Minority surgeon came in and said it went swimmingly. He thought it went extremely well. I started monthly injections.  That really made a huge difference in the way. I felt I suddenly was able to.  Exercise, run, do things that I could do before.  My son is playing hockey his whole life. Needless to say. I was the hockey dad. I took an dollars practices. I did leave early mornings. I did all the traveling with him. I probably enjoyed it as much if not more than he did but it was a huge motivation for me to be functional and available to him.  All the time, this Spray Case body 1971. 240Z dots.  There was a huge importance to me because I know my dad knew these things in high school. He would see him, he wanted one for back then, had a great deal out of Florida and Craigslist. We drove all the way to Detroit. Pick it up. He drove it back, and we're in the process of restoring it. And it's something that I've always wanted to do with them. Especially the father-son project car, it was  A huge thing that I liked. I know he probably would have rather had like a Pontiac GTO or maybe something a little more of them American Muscle. It's a great little car.  The intervals between shots. It's, it's very much like being on a roller coaster. It's almost like a bell curve where I started the bottom. I feel horrible. I take my injection. I start climbing up to a peak where after about two weeks. I feel completely and totally normal. I go to the gym. I want to up early morning. I can stay up until 10:30 11:00.  It's a normal lifestyle and then I start sliding back down. 45 days before my injection is do, I know it's do, I don't need it on my calendar. I can feel that I'm smiling. Now. I'm starting to have a lot more problems. Physically. My body is telling me, I need a little help.  Well, with his condition, he's definitely gone through a lot. It's been really hard for him to wake up every day and to do something activities that he does now. So I definitely appreciate it a lot more than probably. He understands just to see him at all my games because I know it's hard for him to wake up and get out of bed, some days. I appreciate that. He makes the effort to come to the garage and work with me on the car. And he makes the effort to go out and go skiing with me even just if you might not be feeling.  Best that day, so I can't you know, thank you enough for doing everything that he can going through, what he does. I mean just to spend as much time with me as you can.\",\n",

       " '_NoKv4kr64': \"Metabolic syndrome is probably the most serious medical condition that you haven't heard about yet. So, what is metabolic syndrome? Why is it so serious? And why haven't you heard about it? Here's what you need to know. The metabolic syndrome is a cluster of the most dangerous heart attack risk factors. Namely raised blood glucose, Central adiposity, often called beer belly, abnormal cholesterol, levels, abnormal blood fats. Also called triglycerides and high blood pressure. It is estimated that one in four adults have metabolic syndrome and the condition becomes more common as we get older. So that by the age of 50, nearly a third of adults have metabolic syndrome. So why is metabolic syndrome? So important?  Well, if you have metabolic syndrome, you are much more likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke much more likely to develop full-blown, diabetes and much more likely to develop cancer and more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease. All of these conditions are serious, and they are getting far more common, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease have overtaken cancer and heart disease as the leading cause of death in England and Wales in 2016.  I'm the metabolic syndrome and diabetes are thought to be important risk factors for these conditions. So, how can you check to see if you have metabolic syndrome? Well, first of all, get out a tape measure. If you're a man and your waist circumference is more than 94 cm or if you're a woman and your waste is more than 80 cm. You have one of the main features of metabolic syndrome.  If in addition, you have any two of the following, you will be classified as having metabolic syndrome, namely raised blood triglycerides, reduced HDL cholesterol, sometimes known as good cholesterol, raised blood pressure or raised fasting, blood glucose note. If you're a man of South Asian or Indian Heritage, the important threshold for waist circumference, is 90 CM now.  Metabolic syndrome is not yet been classified as a disease. It is still regarded as a collection of signs and symptoms, which together are serious risk factors for our most deadly and disabling medical conditions.  Several medical organizations such as the World Health Organization, the independent diabetes Federation and the European group for the study of insulin resistance Define. Metabolic syndrome in slightly different ways. And this adds even more to the confusion about what exactly metabolic syndrome is. However, many experts now, believe that the underlying problem is in metabolic syndrome is insulin resistance. Insulin.  Students develops, when this hormone cannot work properly, when blood insulin levels are abnormally high, and still relatively ineffective in keeping blood glucose levels regulated, properly, metabolic Specialists. Now increasingly use the term insulin resistance syndrome instead of metabolic syndrome.  Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas and it is important in the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats, when sugar and carbohydrates, are eaten insulin, promotes the uptake of glucose from the blood into muscles and fat cells, hence. It is often said that insulin allows cells to use glucose for energy and also to store excess glucose and sugar as glycogen and fat.  When blood glucose levels fall, stored glucose is released for energy from the breakdown of glycogen in the liver, and in the muscles.  Now, in the metabolic syndrome, insulin levels are chronically high. That means they never really go down back to normal fasting, blood levels of insulin in the morning or often abnormally, high, and insulin levels rise to very high levels. When food is eaten, continuously high levels of insulin, caused the liver cells to store fat resulting in a fatty liver which cannot function normally as the insulin resistance worse.  Means the pancreas may not be able to produce enough insulin in response to food and then glucose levels in the blood. Rise above the threshold, for the person to be called diabetic. So why haven't you heard about metabolic syndrome? Well, until recently the connection between metabolic syndrome and a host of chronic diseases was not fully understood. We now know that insulin resistance is the key.  Until neural until recently. It was very difficult to measure blood insulin levels, but the technology has improved and we can now measure blood insulin levels accurately and we have good tests to diagnose insulin resistance, as well as good strategies to reverse insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome.  You see, once you can measure insulin resistance, you are well on the way to fixing it and monitoring improvement with interventions.  I foresee the emergence of bespoke, metabolic assessments and patient-centered metabolic interventions without drugs or medications for apparently healthy people to reduce the risks of developing high, blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, cancer and dementia. In addition, for those people with these conditions. We can now test for insulin resistance and we can potentially reverse these illnesses.

The problem is not as a result of too much water and obstruction in the pipe is causing the water to not leave. So it starts to accumulate, and you end up with a plumbing disaster.  Could this be what happens in hyperinsulinemia? Hmm, mindful of the connection between too much insulin and fatness, a team of German researchers set about studying insulin clearance rates, but rather than start with fat people.  They started with skinny guys. Yeah, this is a little unconventional. They chose this approach because they wanted to see what happens before everything gets broken, which is often the state of play. When you've turned into an overweight Couch, Potato 10 healthy Physically Active,  Non-smoking medication-free. 20-something males with good pedigrees. Not on theoretical physicists. Had metabolic syndrome signed up to become blobs. They took to eating 300, to 500 extra calories a day and they were considered successful when they had managed to pump up their BMI by two points.  It's and keep it there for at least four weeks. This saw them go from a BMI of 21.8 plus, or minus 0.72 23.8, plus, or minus 2.8. Hmm to be considered overweight. You need to have a BMI of more than 25 to be a beast. The figure jumps to more than 30, so these  Eyes will not exactly blobs even at their heaviest, but they biochemistry had changed, and the extra calories, changed a post-meal curves, a little, they were stole all 100% normal, but the spike in insulin was marginally.  A higher well. Glucose levels remained, pretty much the same every time they tested and they were tested on three different occasions in three different ways. The first test was to see how they handled a standard meal marmalade on toast. The second test was 75 grams of glucose dissolved in  Mm of water. This is a oral glucose tolerance test and the third test was a glucose infusion, the bump in insulin implied, a decrease in insulin sensitivity. They had become a little insulin resistant, using the results from the glucose infusion. The team did used the extra insulin.

Now, in our newbie Chubbies, this process of removing. The insulin was less efficient. This research estimated. It was down by around, 50% resulting in more insulin, entering the circulation. Hmm. And more insulin in circulation means well, more insulin is available to get up to mischief.  The liver must be loafing, allowing the drain to be blocked time to blame the liver. Maybe maybe not as with all things biological. It's probably a lot more complicated. It turns out in some clearance in the liver. Depends on how much zinc is packaged.

It was Albany metformin. I can't remember how many milligrams it was, but it was quite a bit. I'm afraid that didn't really help me a great deal and which you might be in the same position and then of course, the rosiglitazone follows sulfonylureas, we tried various. Drugs built up, the dosage metformin turned into modified release and then in 2005.

I was also given  Remy pill because there was the first signs of kidney damage very slight, but kidney damage, nonetheless. And so there, I had a whole set of five different drugs. I was taking and I was determined to do something about that, mainly because they weren't actually helping, had they been controlling my diabetes. I might have lived with it. But my diabetes continue to get worse. Then I discovered this program. Well, I discovered the the science and I put the program together with extensive research.  I collected products from various different sources for supplementation.

       " 'gUA4ScsRWQ': \"Artificial sweeteners. The name artificial itself. Already perpetuates bad and unnatural sentiments, easily provoking people to steer clear of such ingredients, but the information that is available on artificial sweeteners isn't all that clear, especially with the fact that there is not just one artificial sweetener, but multiple sweeteners of varying substances. Let's take a look at some of the more popular varieties and see what the fuss is all about. We'll start with the most popular aspartame virtually all its  Sweet. Enhanced foods have a varying amounts of aspartame, first made in. 1965. It didn't take long for it to be approved by the FDA. Nine years later by the turn of the century though. Things started to look sour for aspartame due, to a research in 2005, linking aspartame to cancer developments in rodents. The link was made to methanol and aspartame, constituent, that metabolizes into the notorious substance formaldehyde. However, the amount of methanol in Aspartame is  Really small. In fact one serving is a thousand times less than the amounts. Our body produces on a daily basis. Investigating further will see that the rats consumed amounts of aspartame equivalent to 18 cans of diet soda per day. On top of that, our body metabolizes aspartame very differently to rodents making any comparison between humans and rodents questionable human trials. Typically show no issue. At the most aspartame can be a cause for concern for those, with a  Tic disorder known as phenylketonuria since aspartame contains phenylalanine for everyone else. Barring some research linking aspartame to headaches. It seems that a modest dose of aspartame is safe. Moving on to another popular sweetener. Sucralose also used in plenty of drinks and sweets, sir. Clothes is more popularly known as Splenda extensive research shows that sucralose is generally safe. But some do show a potential connection between sucralose and Leukemia. The issue here, though.  Again is the lack of evidence in human trials. Our best understanding is that since we only absorb to 25 percent of sucralose consumed, sucralose should be safe at modest dosages acceptable. Dietary allowance for sucralose is 5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. Averaging out to about 165 packets of Splenda per day, suffice to say, it shouldn't be too hard to stay well below that. But one artificial sweetener that took a lot of beating.  Lee is saccharin. The concern, emanated from a 2014, study titled, artificial sweeteners, induce glucose, intolerance by altering the guts microbiota, although the study looked at other artificial sweeteners, the predominant Focus was saccharine through 11 weeks, researchers found that saccharine, modulated microbiota composition, that impaired, glucose tolerance, in Mike's wondering if it also applies to humans. They conduct a, a seven-day experiments giving seven subjects. The  Acceptable, daily intake of saccharin at 5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day after seven days. Four of the seven subjects did experience microbial imbalances, but it has to be noted that the researchers did not directly conclude that the saccharine induced to dysbiosis did. In fact lead to glucose intolerance in the human subjects. Instead. They took stool samples from the humans transplanted them into mice and then found that it did muck up glucose tolerance for the  The transplanted. Mice in any case, saccharine, fortunately has been mostly replaced in Foods by the more popular sweeteners aspartame and Sucralose. Sakharine's. Mainly accessible these days from sweetener, packets, such as sweet and low. And to wrap up our list, Acesulfame, potassium, or commonly abbreviated as Ace k.a skate, typically tags along with one of the other sweeteners as an additional sweet enhancer. Unlike the others, though, a skate isn't metabolized by our body whatsoever.  It might sound like a broken record. But the sparse evidence against a skate is again, from rodent research on the gut microbiome, when mice were given exorbitant amounts of a scale, a human trials, as you would guess, show very little issue with a skate consumption. What I got out of reading through all of this commotion about artificial sweeteners, though, is that we don't know for sure if they are completely safe in the grand scheme of things. They are nutrition less ingredients that we don't need to have in our food.  Its initial intention was to help us lose weight by replacing sugar. But new research shows that it's not actually good at doing. So, the issue is that people still overeat and that's where the answer. Really lies a diet soda here and there won't ruin your goals, but don't use it as an excuse to let yourself eat more. Ultimately The tried-and-true Remains eat a healthy and balanced diet, count your calories and macros and make sure you don't over eat.  Eat sure your thoughts on artificial sweeteners below.

So whereas in the general population, it's only about two percent who have an autism spectrum disorder in fragile X syndrome.

The most prevalent areas affected by the skin breakdown include bottom aspect of the feet mainly heels and the ball of the foot and tips of the most prominent or the most, hyper contracted tote, the poor peripheral blood circulation of diabetic, people sometimes complicated with poor.  Are of conduction in protection sooner or later. Will weaken the ability of the skin of the affected feet to regenerate and heal ulcers will develop because the feet are far away from the heart. The very last to receive the blood nutrients, as well as the very first to suffer from an impaired. Blood circulation, the reduced blood flow to the foot results in slow, healing and low sensitivity. And as a result diabetic foot, ulcers are responsible for more hospitalizations than any other complications associated with diabetes.

       " '_-cUA_PY8': \"Diabetic nephropathy is one of the most common and serious chronic complications associated with diabetes mellitus in this tutorial. Let's discuss how the mechanisms underlying diabetic nephropathy correlate with the clinical presentation as well as the treatment of the disease now fortunately the mechanisms underlying diabetic nephropathy directly correlate with the clinical presentation and the first clinical finding of the disease is somewhat paradoxically in increased kidney filtration.  Ation rate or glomerular filtration rate. So diabetic nephropathy if you break down the term into Neff row and pathy literally means kidney disease caused by diabetes Now typically kidney disease is marked by a decreased filtration rate. So why is it that the first clinical stage of diabetic nephropathy is that of an increased glomerular filtration rate or card that the earliest mechanism contributing to dive?  In property is an increased pressure State over here in blue and this is due to hypertension and efferent vasoconstriction.  So let's use a common garden hose to help illustrate how this increased pressure state will ultimately result in an increased glomerular filtration rate. So imagine you have this garden hose and it has a small hole in the middle of it. So first you're going to open up the spigot and increase the pressure flow and flow through the hose and intuitively. This is going to increase the wage rate at which water is leaking from the hole in the hose.  Next you partially kick off the end of the hose distal to the hole. And once again, this is going to further increase the rate at which water leaks from the hose and this is essentially what's occurring in the glomerulus with the hypertension representing the opening up of the spigot and increasing the pressure before the glomerulus in front of the Camellias and the efferent vasoconstriction representing the kinking off of the hose which causes this back pressure both of which  Which are going to increase the filtration rate and this stage of diabetic nephropathy is most commonly asymptomatic. So it goes typically unnoticed. However, it's going to set the stage for the next clinical step of diabetic nephropathy and that is detectable protein area. And what protein area is is protein in the urine. So this increased pressure State causes trauma on the museum gym in the middle of the coma.  This year and it results in mesangial expansion, which is this second mechanism of diabetic nephropathy. Now as the museum expands this also increases the size of these fenestrations or spaces between the poto site foot processes. So let's go back and look real closely at these fenestrations and watch how they increase in size now these put aside fenestration.  Ins are a component of the glomerular filtration mechanism. So let's think of these podocytes foot processes as a coffee filter and a proper coffee filter is porous enough to allow for the water to flow through but will retain the coffee grounds within the filter and this is because the molecules of water are much smaller than the size of the coffee ground. So over time the coffee pot is going to fill just with the coffee, but no coffee grounds now.  Imagine if the coffee filter was replaced with the cooking strainer which has considerably larger pores. And if you were to try and use a cooking strainer as a coffee filter when you pour the hot water through it's not going to work because the pores of this cooking strainer are much larger both the watch the coffee as well as the grounds are going to start to spill through and you're going to end up with coffee grounds in your coffee. So in the glomerulus the fenestrations between these pose  site foot processes are kind of like coffee filters and normally in the filtration of blood no proteins or large molecules are allowed through however with mesangial expansion these fenestrations become much larger and when filtration occurs, they become leaky and they allow for molecules such as proteins to be Spilled Out into the urine and so this is what causes the detectable proteinuria  Diabetic nephropathy and one of these proteins is albumin. So urine tests are available to detect the presence of albumin in the urine. So frequently individuals with diabetes will have routine screening to test for this albumin or for protein in their urine, which is a sign that they may be developing diabetic nephropathy or kidney disease due to diabetes then the next clinical stage of diabetic nephropathy. Is that of a decreased glomerular?  Are your filtration rate so you can see that we've gone from an increased glomerular filtration rate then to a decreased glomerular filtration rate. So what exactly causes this well recall that part of the reason for this is Angel expansion is the release of cytokines which cause inflammation and oxygen free radicals. Now these cytokines and oxygen free radicals damage the museum Jim resulting in the m' angel expansion.  However, they don't just damage the machine geum. They damage the cells throughout the tubules as well as the vasculature that supports the nephron now in addition to the cytokines and oxygen free radicals. This vasculature is further damaged by this efferent vasoconstriction here.  Which is one of the causes of that increased pressure State and this combination of damage from decreased blood flow and cytokines and oxygen free radicals results in ischemia and atrophy of this vasculature. And as this fast culture kind of dies off it no longer can support the tubules of the Nephron. So the nephron itself begins to die off as well. And so there's a decreased ability to filter the blood  now initially this occurs in just a small percentage of the nephrons in the kidney and the kidneys able to compensate but eventually over time if this diabetic nephropathy is not treated a large enough number of nephrons throughout the kidney are going to die off and it's going to be detected as a decreased filtration rate the kidneys no longer able to keep up with the dying off of nephrons and if this is present this decreased filtration rate is present for  More than three months in a row, then it's known as chronic kidney disease and as it continues to progress eventually it will become a permanent decreased which is then known as end-stage renal disease.  Now that we have a better understanding of the mechanisms that cause diabetic nephropathy and how they correlate with the clinical presentation. That's just briefly touch on how diabetic nephropathy is treated and this is once again going to be directly correlated to the underlying mechanisms. So most important thing and diabetic nephropathy is to treat the underlying diabetes and this is because the hyperglycemia associated with diabetes is the  Cause of this increased pressure state, so if you can treat the diabetes, you can prevent the increased pressure state which will then prevent the Cascade of effects leading to diabetic nephropathy. However, if this increased pressure state does start to occur the next step is to treat the pressure and what I mean by that is treat the hypertension, so if you can decrease the blood pressure,  That goes into the afferent arteriole here, you'll decrease this increased pressure state in addition. One of the most common medications to treat blood pressure are known as ACE inhibitors. Now ACE inhibitor stands for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and Angiotensin is one of the hormones in that renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that results in the efferent vasoconstriction, so  Treating the blood pressure with an Ace inhibitor. You're also going to decrease this vasoconstriction to further decrease this pressure state within the glomerulus and these two treatments should be occurring regardless of whether or not an individual with diabetes have is in any of these clinical stages of diabetic nephropathy. So these are not only treatments, but they're also good for preventing the progression of  Diabetic nephropathy before someone even enters this first clinical stage. However, if someone does develop diabetic nephropathy and it fortunately progresses far enough to have this decreased glomerular filtration rate and they end up in end-stage renal disease. Unfortunately, then there are only two treatment options and the first is dialysis in which the blood is filtered outside the body by a machine to kind of replace.  Effect of the kidney and the other is a kidney transplant fortunately though, like most of the complications of diabetes mellitus if the underlying disease and it's comorbidities such as hypertension are properly treated diabetic nephropathy can be a preventable complication of diabetes mellitus.\",\n",

The pancreas transplant operation is done through an abdominal midline incision. And that is an up-and-down incision on the abdomen. We connect the artery and the vein that both Supply, the blood to the pancreas and return the blood back to the body. And and then once we allow the blood flow into the pancreas, we have to connect a small piece of intestine that comes with the pancreas organ to the patient's intestine.  To allow drainage of the exocrine material into the patient's body previously. People would connect that to the bladder, but we really don't do that procedure anymore because the patients tolerate, it being connected to the intestines, much better. It's not just associated with long-term complications like connecting it to the bladder is  The combined kidney and pancreas transplant. Operation is done through an abdominal midline incision. And we, and that is an incision that runs up and down on the abdomen. And we place the kidney and the pancreas and almost like two different operations in the abdomen. Typically, we'll put the kidney. In first, allow the blood flow back into the kidney and let it start working and then in a separate location, but through the same incision, put the pancreas in. So the  Wakes up having had two operations done on the inside, but through one incision and both organs are hopefully functioning immediately. They're making urine. The creatinine is coming down, reflecting kidney function, and the pancreas is making insulin, and the glucose has become normal.  Pancreas after kidney. Transplant operations would be two separate operations. Done through two different, incisions two different hospital stays and of course, two independent recoveries as well.  With the pancreas transplant alone. The quality of life is primarily focused upon normalizing, someone's glucose control.  Patients, who are typically undergoing a pancreas alone. Transplant have a very difficult quality of life, from extreme difficulties in controlling, their blood sugars. So they will run from being very low and having hypoglycemia, which can lead to passing out or seizures having to call for emergency help problems like that and then alternatively swings towards the high end by the end up with very high glucose has  To end up being hospitalized for control of your diabetes, when the pancreas is successful. All their glucose is should become normal, and they avoid both the lows and the highs and have excellent. Glucose control long-term. The advantage of that is that complications from diabetes. What we refer to as secondary complications, are either reversed or minimized.  Quality of life after the combined procedure is fantastic. He's individuals come in with two problems. Kidney failure. Aww. Most of the time on dialysis and a very long period of time of having been diabetic, taking insulin, having difficulties with controlling their glucose has. And after this single operation, both of those problems are fixed. So they feel fantastic. They're no longer on dialysis or impending about to go on. They no longer have to take insulin.  And having swings in their blood sugars and having normal control. So, we fix the kidney problem. We've picked their diabetes and when this works, well, it is an outstanding result for the individual.  So individuals that receive a pancreas transplant, can expect the organ too often last for 10 years or more on average. It is a very durable therapy. It is able to function for many, many years when the patient is compliant and especially when it early rejection episodes are avoided.  Even from a deceased donor, the combined operation. It is probably mostly a function of us able to being able to monitor the kidney to pick up on problems related to rejection. It's hard to track rejection of the pancreas. Whereas it's easy to track rejection of the kidney. So if you have both organs and you can follow the kidney quite easily and know that there's trouble and increase.  This oppression. If there's rejection and treat. Both in both organs. It tends to correlate. So, if you're having rejection the kidney, you're typically having rejection the pancreas and that's at least an 80 percent correlation for those two. So, initially after the operation is done patients, spend at least a week in the hospital and often a couple of weeks in the hospital.  Once someone goes home, they are getting Labs drawn, twice a week. Usually close to home and coming back for outpatient visits on a weekly basis and then every other week and then once a month and for the first couple of months, they're back here for outpatient visits fairly frequently. But once time goes on, they're able to just follow up every three months, but still getting Labs twice a week then once a week, every  Other week and then monthly.  So long-term follow-up it, which I would say is after the first year, patients are seen once every three months in a doctor's office appointment and get Labs drawn once a month.  Patients come to Hopkins to look into a pancreas transplant for several reasons. One. There's a big team of people here that are dedicated to taking care of transplant. Patients, the expertise that these individuals bring is fantastic for this patient population. And this includes surgeons, medical Physicians nurse coordinators nurse practitioners. Everyone together has had a lot of experience, taking care of pancreas transplant patients. And as a result that Collective,  Experience is great for helping someone through the operative procedure and then the post-operative recovery. A second reason, the patients come to Hopkins to look into a pancreas transplant, is the experience that we have with taking care of sensitized. Patients. These are individuals that have antibody in their bloodstream are often difficult to transplant and the experience that has been gained in both the kidney and pancreas transplant. Populations, that have antibody. That makes transplantation.  Alt draws. Individuals here.

       " 'KAeihnbv0': \"I'm going to draw a little cell here for us. This cell is going to be a typical cell, and it's going to be full of potassium. We know that cells love to hold onto potassium. So, let's draw lots of potassium in here and the concentration. Potassium would say, is something like, 150 Milli moles per liter. That's a lot of potassium. Right? And I'm going to put brackets because brackets indicate concentration. And of course, there's some potassium in the  Outside to let's say the concentration. Here is something like five millimoles per liter.  And I have to also show you how this concentration gradient gets set up, right? It's not like it just happens to be set up. It's it's something that we put a lot of energy into into creating. So you get to potassium's Pumped in and you actually kick out to or sorry. Three, sodium's. So that's how you get all those potassium's in there in the first place. So now that they're in there. Are they hanging out by themselves. The answer is definitely, no.  They are finding anions that are negatively charged molecules or atoms to sit next to. And so, the net charge is going to be neutral, right? Because every cation has an anion and usually these anions are things like proteins, something that has maybe like a negative side chain, like a protein could be a chloride could be, phosphate could be a number of things. So any one of these anions would be fine. And actually, let me draw a little  A couple of anions here as well. For these two potassium's that just got welcomed into our cell. And so this is how things look, you know, if things are nice and static. This is how they look. And actually, to be quite honest. There's also a little anion hanging out here is well for this potassium. So now that the truth is that we have little gaps in our cell, little holes, where we allow potassium to actually leaked out. So let's actually show how that would look and how that would affect what's going on. So we have these little channels.  And they only allow potassium through. So these channels are actually very specific for potassium. They're not going to allow any anion through or any other thing out the protein. Certainly can't get out. And so these potassium's are kind of looking at these channels that are there and there are thinking, huh. This is interesting. There's a lot of potassium in here. We're going to want to just, you know, slip out. And so these potassium's just kind of bail on the cell and they just get right outside now,  They do that. And interesting thing happens, most of them move outside, but you know, there are some potassium's outside as well. I said that there was this one little fellow over here and he could theoretically kind of make his way in over here. You could you know come into this cell if he wanted to but the truth is overall on on the whole on net you have more movement outside than you do inside. And so I'll just for the time being erased, that path just because I want you to remember that. Overall we have  Work, potassium, that's going to move outside because of the concentration gradient. In fact, that's Point. Number one. Such. Let me write that down here concentration. Gradient is going to make the potassium move outside.  And that's on net. So the potassium starts moving out, right? It's okay out. And what happens next? Well, when it moves outside, let me actually draw it moving outside. So, this K is now over here and this K is over here. And what it's left behind is an anion. In fact, this guy's left behind an eye on as well. And those anions. They are all buy them all by their lonesome.  They start generating a negative charge, a big big negative charge as you just a few ions moving back and forth. Will create a negative charge and these potassium is on the outside. They're thinking to themselves, huh? Oh, that's interesting. There's a negative charge in there. And if there's a negative charge in there, they're attracted to it because they're thinking, well, I'm positive. This is a negative charge. I want to go back inside. And so on the one hand.  Think about it. You have a concentration, gradient driving, potassium out. But on the other hand you have this what we call membrane potential in this case, a negative one, a membrane potential that gets set up because the potassium is Left Behind an anion that's actually going to drive the potassium to want to be back inside. So you have one force the concentration, driving k out and another Force, the membrane potential that gets created by its absence. That's going to drive.  Back in. So I'm going to actually make a little space. So I'm going to show you something that's kind of interesting. So let's create two curves. Let's say we have. Actually, I don't want to lose everything on this. Slide the me out. You just set this up here so you can see the last little bit of it. So let's set up two curves. One will be for the concentration gradient and one will be for the membrane potential. So this is let's say k out and you actually if you followed it over time, this is time. You'd actually see that.  That you actually have something like that K is actually going to move out over time and it's going to at some point get to an equilibrium. And if we did the exact same thing with time on this axis right here, and let's say, this is membrane potential membrane potential and we start at x 0, and this is also negative axis. So this is going more and more - this way, and we start at zero for the membrane.  Joel and this is at the point where you start letting the K kind of wander out. You get something like this, basically looks the same but it is kind of a parallel of what's going on with the concentration, gradient. And when the to equal each other, when the amount of K moving out equals the amount of K moving in, we get to this kind of plateau and turns out, it's about 90 - 92 millivolts. So that's the point where you really have almost no difference.  In terms of the net movement of K, it's equal. And in fact, we even call that term, we call that the equilibrium potential for potassium. So when you get to that negative 92, and it differs depending on the eye on, but when you get to the negative 92 for potassium, you've hit its equilibrium potential. So, let me just write that out for k.  Is - 92. And again, this is assuming that the cell is only permeable to one thing which is potassium. Now this actually might still bring up a certain question. You had you might be thinking and I want to make sure I address this. Well, wait a second, if potassium ions are moving out, and that's what I said is happening, then at some point, don't we have a lower concentration in here?  Because the potassium is actually left and a higher concentration out here because, you know, potassium is moving outside. And technically, that is correct. I mean, of course, you have more potassium ions on the outside. And, you know, I haven't said the volume is changed. So, yes, you would have a higher concentration and the same is true for the cell. You would have a lower concentration technically, but realistically, I haven't changed the numbers in the reason I haven't changed the numbers is because if you look at the numbers, these are moles. I mean, this is a huge number, right?  6.02 times 10 to the 23rd. That's not a small number. And if you multiply it by 5, then you get something, you know, this kind of works out to about, I'm going to quickly do the math. Six times. Five is about 30, and then you got mmol here to consider. So about 10 to the 20 moles, right? I mean, that's an enormous number of potassium ions. And really, you just need a handful of ions to create this negative charge. So if only a handful of ions  Eyes are moving back and forth. You're not going to really make a difference to that enormous. Number 10 to the 20th. So that's why we don't really think of the concentrations is changing very much at all.\",\n",
       " 'vtei8hw': \"Have you ever wondered what it might be like to be inside a cell? Imagine the genetic material the cytoplasm the ribosomes you'll find those in almost all cells prokaryotes and eukaryotes eukaryotes cells in addition have membrane-bound organelles.  All of those structures and organelles have different functions, but cells are not isolated Little Worlds. They do have a lot going on inside them. But they also need to interact with their environment. It makes sense that to keep a stable environment inside themselves, otherwise known as keeping homeostasis. They must have some control on what goes in and what goes out of them. A very important structure for this that all cells contain is,  The cell membrane by controlling what goes in and out. The cell membrane helps regulate homeostasis. It's the homeostasis King. Let's take a look at the cell membrane. You could have a whole course on the cell membrane itself. It has amazing structure. It has signaling abilities, but to stick to the very Basics. It's made of a phospholipid bilayer, bilayer means two layers. So you have these two layers of lipids.  Now, these lipids, they're called phospholipids. Will they have a head? That is polar, and they have a tail. That is nonpolar, making them quite unique, some molecules. They have no problem going through the cell membrane and they directly go through the phospholipid. Bilayer. Very small nonpolar. Molecules. They fit in this category. They're a great example, like some gases oxygen and carbon dioxide gas. Those are great examples.  Bulls this is known as simple. Diffusion. Also, it doesn't take any energy to force those molecules in or out. So it's known as passive transport simple, diffusion moves with the flow. Meaning it moves with the concentration. Gradient molecules move from high concentration to low concentration.  So when you hear someone saying that something's going with the concentration, gradient. That's what they mean. They mean it's going from a high concentration of molecules to a low concentration of molecules. Now remember how we said the cell membrane is actually a pretty complex structure. Well, one thing we haven't mentioned yet are proteins in the membrane and some of them are transport proteins, some transport proteins act as channels. Some of these proteins actually change their shape to get things.  Cross some of them open and closed based on some kind of stimulus. All of these are good things because it's helping with molecules, that may be too big to cross the membrane on their own or molecules that are polar and therefore need the help of a transport protein. This is known as facilitated diffusion. It's still diffusion and it still moves with the concentration, gradient of high to low. It doesn't require energy though. So it's also a  a type of passive transport. It's just the proteins are facilitating or helping things pass charged. Ions, often require a protein channel in order to pass through glucose needs. The help of a transport protein to pass through in, osmosis for water to travel at a fast rate across the membrane. It passes through protein channels called aquaporins. So these are all examples of facilitated diffusion, which  Type of passive transport and moves with the concentration, gradient of high to low concentration. Now, all the transport we've mentioned, has been passive in nature. That means it's going from high concentration to low concentration. But what if you want to go the other way, for example, the cells lining your gut, they need to take in glucose, but what if the concentration of glucose in the cell is higher than the amount of glucose concentration in the environment?  We would still need to get the glucose in. So it's going to have to be forced against the regular gradient flow movement of molecules from low to high concentration will take energy because that's against the flow. Typically is going to require ATP energy, a reminder that ATP adenosine triphosphate. It has three phosphates and when the bond for the last phosphate is broken, it releases a great amount of energy. Yeah.  So ATP is a pretty awesome little molecule ATP can power, active transport to force molecules to go against their concentration, gradient. And one way it can do, that is actually energizing the transport protein itself. One of our favorite examples of active transport is the sodium potassium pump. So that's definitely something worth checking out. There's other times. A cell needs to exert energy for transport. We're still in active transport right now, but let's  A a cell needs, a very large molecule. Let's say a big polysaccharide, you check out our biomolecule video. That's a large carbohydrate. Well, you may need the cell to fuse with the molecules. It's taking in in order to bring it inside, and this is called endocytosis. Think Endo for in often this fusing of substances, within the cell membrane will form vesicles that can be taken inside the cell.  Endocytosis is kind of a general term. There are different types of endocytosis depending on how that cell is bringing substances inside amoebas. For example, rely on a form of endocytosis in this example pseudopod stretch out around what they are going to engulf and then it pulls it into a vacuole and there are other forms to such as the fancy receptor-mediated endocytosis. This is where cells can be very, very, very picky on. What's  Being in because the incoming substances actually have to bind to receptors to even get in or pinocytosis. This allows cells to take in fluids. So to the Google to find out more details of the different types of endocytosis, exocytosis is the reverse direction of endocytosis think exhausting exit. They sound very similar to exocytosis can be used to get rid of cell waste but it's also  Oh really important for getting valuable materials out that the cell is made. When a cool example will think back to those polysaccharides. Did you know that large carbohydrates are also really important for making plant cell walls. Cell walls are different from cell membranes in all cells have membranes but not all cells have a wall, but plant cells do and if you're going to make a cell wall, you're going to need to get those carbohydrates that are produced in the plant cell.  Out of the cell to make the wall. So there's a great example of when you'd need exocytosis right there. Well, that's it. For the amoeba sisters and we remind you to stay curious.\",\n",

       " 'QFQVm96YM': \"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is actually a spectrum of disease.  Going from least to most severe steatosis steatohepatitis fibrosis in finally cirrhosis.  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease result from fat deposition in the liver, which is unrelated to alcohol or viral causes.  Typically, it affects individuals with metabolic syndrome, which includes a combination of three of the five, following diagnosis, obesity hypertension, diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia and hyperlipidemia.  Given how common metabolic syndromes become, it's not surprising that the rate of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, is also increased dramatically. It's a massive problem growing in lockstep with expanding waist lines affecting about three-quarters of all obese individuals, including many children.  Although the exact mechanism of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, isn't clear insulin-resistant, seems to play an important role overtime, insulin receptors on various tissues, including the liver, become less responsive to insulin. And as a result, the liver goes into a mode where it increases fat storage and decreases fatty acid. Oxidation, that means decreased secretion of lipids into the bloodstream in the form of lipoproteins and increased synthesis and uptake of free fatty acids from the blood.  A process called steatosis.  See, you ptosis causes fat droplets to form within hepatocytes. Some of which become large enough to cause the hepatocytes to swell up with fat and push, the nuclei to the edge of the cell.  You can even see this on a histopathology slide of the liver. All these white circles are large, deposits of fat.  Zooming out and looking at the liver. You see widespread steatosis, which makes a liver, a large soft. Yellow and greasy.  Over time that fat in the hepatocytes becomes vulnerable to degradation unsaturated, fatty acids, or fatty acids that have at least one double bond in their carbon chain. Have hydrogen atoms that are especially vulnerable to initiators like reactive oxygen species. Like the hydroxyl radical which has an unpaired electron.  In this example, the hydroxyl radical pairs with the vulnerable lipid, hydrogen to make water and a fatty acid radical.  The fatty acid radical is unstable and reacts with non radicals, including molecular oxygen and undamaged fatty acids.  This goes out until one radical species reacts with another radical species, which terminates the reaction.  This process damages lipid membranes leading to things like mitochondrial, dysfunction, and eventually cell death.  Cell death, generates inflammation and together, the process of steatosis and inflammation is referred to as steatohepatitis.  In the absence of alcohol. This is called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or Nash.  In addition to bloating and dying hepatocytes, there might be additional histopathologic changes like the presence of Mallory denk bodies, which are Tangles of intermediate, filaments, that can be seen in the cytoplasm of hepatocyte 16. The mechanism though, for how these form is still unclear, hepatocyte damage also attracts neutrophils into the liver tissues.  And finally chronic Seattle, hepatitis can cause liver stellate cells to lay down fibrotic tissue causing the disease to be classified as fibrosis.  As a process of fibrosis continues, the overall architecture of the liver changes to the point where the disease is classified as cirrhosis.  Even at the advanced stage of steatohepatitis, an individual might have no symptoms. And when there are symptoms, they're often vague like fatigue or malaise.  Once they're significant liver damage, though. There can be hepatomegaly or enlargement of the liver pain in the right. Upper quadrant of the abdomen jaundice, and even an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity called ascites.  Because of parasites are being destroyed. There can be an increase in liver enzymes like aspartate, transaminase or AST. And to a lesser extent, alanine transaminase or alt plastically. Progression of steatosis. Does the a do hepatitis and then to cirrhosis causes an increase in the alt? And sometimes, AST in contrast alcoholic liver injury, generally causes a big increase in AST, in a more modest, increase in alt giving an AST 2  T ratio generally greater than 2.  If not, alcoholic fatty liver disease is suspected, a diagnosis can be made with imaging studies, like ultrasound a CT scan or an MRI to look for fatty infiltrates.  In addition to biopsy of the liver can be done to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the disease. Generally speaking a liver with more than 5% fat content is considered abnormal.  Steatosis. And to a lesser degree steatohepatitis is generally reversible by addressing the underlying cause although that's generally not the case. Once fibrosis and cirrhosis is set in  The goal is to reverse the factors that contribute to insulin resistance, mainly through a healthy diet and an active lifestyle as well as medications to control blood glucose levels, if needed.  All right, as a quick recap non-alcoholic fatty liver disease happens. When fat is deposited in the liver, a process called steatosis inflammation from see as can lead to steatohepatitis and chronic steatohepatitis can lead to fibrosis and ultimately to cirrhosis.  This spectrum of disease is thought to be caused by insulin resistance, and depending on the stage of the disease. It can be reversed with careful attention to diet and exercise, as well as with medications to help control blood glucose levels.  Thanks for watching.

       " 'wH4oEz94qE': \"As you can see, in this gentleman right here. He's got a liver and then this organ down here. It's referred to as the pancreas. Now, the pancreas sits in the retroperitoneum, which relative to the liver, which sits in the peritoneum or in the abdomen. The pancreas is found to the back and to the left to the back and to the left and what's distinctive about the pancreas is its blood supply and so we can go through that in a little  More detail after I blow up the pancreas right here and move it over just a little bit. Now. The pancreas is like most organs in that it receives, oxygen rich, arterial blood flow and gives off oxygen poor blood flow through the venous system. So this is the venous blood right here and this is the arterial blood. But in addition to these two things, the pancreas also receives blood flow from the  Austin, which I can draw right here. The small intestine will deliver unique nutrient-rich blood through the pancreas and this is nutrient-rich blood through the portal venous system. This is the portal venous blood flow. And once this nutrient rich, blood flows through the pancreas, it will trigger hormone release hormones, such as insulin and glucagon, and that'll actually be released into the  Portal venous blood and travel, along with the rest of the nutrients, to the liver, and the cool thing about the hormones, going straight to the liver. First means that the effects they have. There are four times greater than what you will see in the rest of the body. So, insulin and glucagon from the pancreas will have four times greater effect in the liver than in the rest of the body. But now the thing about the pancreas is that it doesn't just contain insulin and glucagon hanging out in  And themselves. They're organized. So if we blow up a small part of the pancreas, right over here, we would see this, which is a collection of cells here like an island surrounded by other cells. These other cells in the outside secrete enzymes that go into the GI tract, and we won't worry too much about them now, but the cells here in this island are referred to as the eyelet.  Of langerhans, so it's the islet of langerhans, which is just a fancy term for an island of cells. And the way the cells are organized in here is very structured, you'll have what are called beta cells in the middle of the island. And on the outside you'll have what are called alpha cells. So alpha cells on the outside and the key thing to remember here is that your beta cells release insulin while the alpha cells.  Release glucagon, the alpha cells release glucagon, and we can actually go into further detail about how beta cells. For instance, secrete insulin into the blood. Let's start by focusing on this beta cell right here and I'll be sure to label. This is a beta cell right here. This is our beta cell and these guys store insulin. So I'll write insulin here in this secretory vesicle and I'll show you how it's released into the  Stream, this secretory vesicle much, like many secretory vesicles in the body will release their contents outside of the cell, if there's calcium present. So, I'll put this calcium receptor here for now. The other thing that's unique about beta cells is that they have these potassium channels. So potassium channels that allow potassium to leave beta cells through facilitated diffusion. So they're just naturally leaving the beta cell over time, which means that it rest. There's a lot more potassium.  Ions living outside of the beta cell, then there are inside of the beta cell and that's an important distinction because that's how we prevent the beta cell from being depolarized or getting a more positive charge within the cell. And this potassium Channel also has a receptor on it that I promise. I'll go into more detail about in a minute, but it grabs onto a teepee, the basic molecule of energy. And in addition to the potassium Channel. There's also this calcium channel, so it's a  Calcium channel that sitting here like in most cells and open through depolarization and we'll go into how that happens in a second. All right. So now we're ready. How does insulin leave the beta cell? Well, the first thing that has to happen is that glucose needs to enter the cell somehow, because when there's a lot of glucose around, we want to store it away. That's what insulin supposed to do. And the way it enters is through this unique transporter. It's called the glute to transporter and it allows glucose to enter into.  Your beta cell. Once we get glucose inside of the cell, glucose will undergo what it usually does. In most cells processes such as glycolysis or be broken down into things that are sent through the Krebs cycle. And doing this, second thing here will produce a lot of ATP molecules. So we mentioned ATP already atp's that basic form of energy, and it's important in this cell. Because once we start to build up the amount of ATP, that's present some of it.  Go down here to this potassium Channel, and bind the ATP receptor that sits here. Now, the interesting thing about this ATP receptor is that once it locks in, it'll actually block off this channel. It will prevent potassium from leaving. So, the next thing that will happen is that the amount of potassium in the cell will start to Skyrocket because there's no way for it to get out anymore. So, you'll have a lot more potassium, or a lot more positive charge inside of the cell, then you have relative to what's outside.  Side. And what that's going to do is cause depolarization, depolarization of the membrane of the beta cell that then we'll go and activate these voltage-gated calcium channels. Allowing calcium to enter the beta cell, which in turn can also cause calcium dependent calcium release into the cell, but over wall, it starts increasing the amount of calcium that's present on the inside. And as you might remember,  The insulin secretory vesicle has a calcium receptor here. So sure enough. The next thing that occurs is that calcium will bind this receptor causing this vesicle to fuse with the membrane of the beta cell. That'll cause insulin to be kicked out of the beta cell and be released into the bloodstream. This step here is you might recall this final step that kicks the insulin out of the cell is what's called exocytosis.  Exocytosis where a vesicle fuses with the cell membrane to release its contents into the outside or the extracellular space, which in this case is the portal venous blood, which will send it to the liver. So that's how insulin is released from beta cells. What about glucagon? How is it released from alpha cells? Well, unfortunately, we don't know as well, how this process works all we know so far is that amino acids trigger?  Glucagon release. How it does, this specifically is a question and even perhaps a Nobel Prize up for grabs, which I think is fair to say. Because the Nobel Prize in 1923 went to two scientists named Banting and Best for discovering insulin. And the crazy thing about that. Is that Charles best who shares in the Nobel Prize was a medical student the time. The study was done in 1921 and then two years later.  He was able to share the Nobel Prize with his Professor, which is just mind-boggling to think about.\",\n",
       " 'KW04fSoA': \"Makeup challenge that all of these Able Body YouTubers do that kind of simulate being blind or being deaf and kind of our opinions on them. So what is your opinion on? Yeah. So basically, if you don't know what the whisper challenge is, I think there might be a few variations on it. But the one that I'm most familiar with it was people had have headphones on. I don't know if they had music on or what but, um, you know that have, you know, their ears cover what possibly music on and then the person will, you know, talk and then they try to guess so. But  Basically, it's like a lip ring challenge. But what kind of like the game of telephone? Like when you're yeah, that's probably your least favorite game during. Oh God, biology class. We're gonna put telephone. I'm like, I'm gonna ruin the game. Yeah. But anyway, yeah, so I'm actually made a video about this like in your and a half ago, my made it private because I feel like my opinion. It has kind of changed just ever so slightly like I think what I'm most  Or is kind of about about approach. Yeah, but at the same time I'm kind of like look if you really want to do a challenge like this. You might want to be a little more realistic about it. Like I don't really cook like it. This happens in ASL. Classes are going, this is ridiculous, but you would be better off like the king, your plugs, in your ears and stuff like having your bones of Music laughter, you know, the whole time. But yeah, before your hair color,  I was like, oh my God, I do this all the time. Again, kids are, you know, laughing about it? And you know, blah blah blah, but just was like in real life. If I didn't understand what you were saying, most of the time, my, the reaction to like, oh my God, you didn't understand be okay. Now, for my whatever I'm still, you know, a lot of the way so that when it really gets annoying, so I guess it really depends on who does it. Yeah. So it's like, I know I'm watching you like, if I know you've done with my Jones before and you laughed about it, and then you're going to treat me like, you know, poop because I didn't want to know what you're gonna say.  All you whereon. Yeah, like if you're like, oh, I just won't bother talking to her, because she can't understand what I'm saying. It's like, you should have, if you did the whisper challenge, you should have gained some respect for ended up. Exactly. It's kind of weird. I mean, if you're gonna do it, you're gonna know it, whatever, but it's just look wrote about it. I agree. Like when I see YouTubers, do the blindfolded makeup challenge or no mirror makeup challenge and like and they're just going on about how it's like so impossible and so difficult. I feel like they're over dramas like they're making it so dramatic. Unlike its  I'd literally do my makeup without a mirror without looking at every single day of my life and I get that, I do it every day. So for me, it has become easier, but even when I first like, I feel like they just get so dramatic about how it's just impossible and all I got was no. I know, I'm like, stop being overdramatic. It's not impossible. And and I do think it's all about the approach, like when they're being realistic about it, when they're being respectful and recognizing that some people like us do go through life as if there's headphones on her ears and can't hear properly. And some people do  Do our makeup without being able to look like it's it is possible and when you be respectful when you're making these videos and recognize that some of your viewers who are watching it might not be able to hear well or might not be able to see like it's all about the approach and not making it like so overdramatic and and almost like disrespectful to communities of people who do actually have to live their life that way. So I feel like we had probably have a pretty similar. Yeah. Yeah. And you know on it that it's like it's cool to do but just like be respectful.  When you're doing like is that man in the world, but, you know, like if we're seeing at that time, you know, we're going to make a comment about it and I'm like, okay by my side. Okay, fine. What's this? What's this? What's this issue here? Every mirrorless makeup challenge, I have commented on about how I do it every day. I just get, like, hundreds of replies in. Like, you're not blind, you're typing. I'm like, oh God. All of the people who, like, the misconceptions that are out there in the lack of lack of knowledge, which is  Why we make these videos, right? Yes. Okay. So some of the other topics we thought we would talk about are things like education. So how being blind affected my education growing up in the accommodations that I need and helping deaf affected kind of your education. What combinations? Yeah, and keep in mind that this is all of your personal experience, of course, you know, love like a 38 to 48 million people who are deaf or hard of hearing and you won't die. It stays low. They know every it's different for everyone. But yeah, but like, you know,  No, there's always going to be like a group of people to read the same experience. Oh, so, you know, just keep that in mind. So I started first thing. You wanna talk about school. /? Yeah. So for me, growing up, I had an E, A. So an educational assistant and a vision, I territory VI teacher. So my EA would be with me 50% of the time, so it in Canada. It depends on the amount of vision you have. So some people who have more Vision, get less support simply because they don't need as much support and then people like me. So because I grew up  More significantly, visually impaired. I had 100% support which means 50% of my time and I Danny a fifty percent of my time. I division itinerary. So I had a one-on-one teacher with me at all times pretty much which in some ways I liked, but in other ways was really frustrating because it made me it like just made me different. You know, it made me stand out in school. Everybody was like, oh, she's the girl with teacher sitting beside her. We don't want to talk to her. So that was frustrating. And one of my vision itinerants people actually thought was my mom, like, oh, I guess she looks.  Similar to me. So people thought I brought my mom to school with me. I was like, oh no, I don't know, Ruby legal annoying. So so like obviously it's something I needed in order to get my education to in order, you know, my vision itinerant would translate everything from print to Braille or from small print large print and she would help me just get the accommodations I need and help the teacher. Understand my situation when I was at an age that was too young to be able to explain it or advocate for myself. So the obvious system that was necessary for me to have but at the same time  It was frustrating at times Rumi. I was one of the very many, you know. Darko's, I grew up many times. I went to public school with like a crap ton. I'm hearing because I probably like one of them only their options are open. The only one but um, so I didn't really get that in those officially until I was 12 and he meant for a couple of years after that. I didn't really pay attention to it. Like I think it was like one of those things where I was like, no, it's fine. It's fine. It's all fine. We're like  And pay attention to it, because I'm a teenager who care. But, um, so growing up there. Um, let's see, I didn't have access to closed captioning. So when we had to watch films and do like, write down 30 backs, you know, a lots of papers were incomplete. Normally, I could get away with, like, you know, finding another person paper isn't like copy it down because we all did that here or not, but there was one time when our teacher literally made fun of me about the attack.  Glass ringing out my paper videos. Yeah. Entire video on that. So you can go to my channel and find that and then like really mostly a combination quote that they gave me was just like sitting on the phone to class and hoping for the best. Like so do they not have like special teachers that would go to school with you or if they did I think the most we have would like the special education classes, Allah Almighty mother like dude.  Drinking knew about the fact that I couldn't hear very well but like a, my counselors know, but they didn't really suggest anything. So, I was just kind of like I was just standing there and I'm kind of hoping for the best. Yeah, so, it's just like, okay, fend for yourself. Like you figure it out. Yep. Good luck. It was okay. No. Wow, that's, uh, now, I feel more grateful for the accommodations. I did have even though it was frustrating at times. Oh, yeah, and now more and more as like. Are you kidding me right now?  I'm shocked. You didn't like, they didn't provide more for you. That's, that's not. I mean like I went to the School for the Blind for two years. So, obviously there, I didn't have one on one sport because the whole school was designed for blind people and all the teachers were specially trained to work with my people. So you probably could have gone to a School for Deaf but chose not to. Yeah, it turns out that there was one a little farther out. Like I said, a little bit more than 30 minutes, maybe 20 minutes. I was an hour and a half away. So I took an hour and a half bus right there, every day and an hour.  Half was recalled. Uh, yeah, for me I would have to be driven. Like, I don't know, they have any buses but like, the person has mostly at home. She is a word that you could describe it to make this. Not so, you know, sad and stuff. But um, so yeah. In North Carolina where I live at other. The Morgan Hill School for the Deaf and I don't know. Like I could think most parents my dad really didn't even pay attention to all, you know, hearing off something so like  Maybe about had a dump people come up to the door at our house and then be like, hi were teaching ASL classes. I'm gonna be like, uh, not very good with the like, you know, nobody in a bit. So that's pretty much my entire childhood as a deaf person in a nutshell, which is crazy. Because to put that in perspective for my blind viewers, like that's like your parents being like, oh, she doesn't need to learn Braille. Like she doesn't need to know how to read or write. That's that's nice that your friends like that. You didn't get to be able to like have the  Opportunity to learn ASL growing up which could have probably really helped you now, so you don't have to learn now to be more a part of your deaf Community. Yeah, and like there was a thing where I like most of the kids warmington, I think like because teachers just don't know how to teach that kid. That there are mainstream school. Like they end up graduating school with like a third grade reading level for the most part. So it's kind of like, okay, there's no like from that program looking to shut down.  Now, twenty sixteen years old. Fuck a duck. Yeah, when you learn about, I know, I mean, people now Braille is kind of like a dying language. Like now some kids are learning Braille in school. Instead. They're just learning how to use technology because when I was growing up technology wasn't where it is now, so I had to learn. Braille. It was my only option, whereas now technology is someplace. They're just teaching blind children and low-vision kids how to use technology instead of learning Braille, but the problem with that is especially if you're, if you're learning something like voiceover,  Our Jaws, which is a speaking program. You're only ever listening to things and you're never actually reading them with your eyes or fingers. So you don't really learn proper grammar, proper spelling, all of these things that are so important for the English language and because like English language are words aren't phonetic. Our words aren't spelt the way they sound. He'll flip burning so difficult. Yeah, I can imagine. So it's anyways, um, another topic we wanted to cover something. I've talked about a lot here on my channel is  Is.\",\n",
       " 'q2vPQYP0dpI': \"Hey guys, dr. Burke here. Now. I want to do a video on the most important electrolyte. Now. Let me explain. What electrolyte is. If you ever take salt and put it in water and dissolve it, it disassociates the sodium and chloride disconnect, and they become two separate minerals. Okay, and that fluid is very electrically conductive. So basically electrolytes have to do with minerals that help conduct.  TriCity in the body. So they helped with a lot of different things. And so as far as electrolytes, it would be like, potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, chlorides all those minerals. Okay. Now potassium out of all of the electrolytes is the one that we need in very large quantities, and I was curious. Why is that? Why do we need potassium in such large amounts? I'm talking. 47 hundred milligrams to  6,000 milligrams every single day. That's equivalent to 7 to 10 plus cups of salad or vegetable every single day. That's a lot. That's odd to me. And no one consumes that much, but let's, let's go dig further and exactly why we need potassium. There's something in the body called the sodium potassium pump. Okay, and it's built in a little protein connected to an end.  Zyme it forms a whole enzyme on the surface of your cells. And you have between 800,000 to 30 million of these little tiny pumps. And their little generators, that generate electricity to allow things to go through the cell. So they take a lot of energy to to work. In fact, one-third of all the food that you eat, the energy of one, third of your diet, goes to run.  Those pumps. Okay. You also have another pump in the stomach called the hydrogen potassium atpase. Don't worry about the name, but it's basically another pump that's build with potassium that allows you to create stomach acid to help you digest. These pumps also are in the muscles, there in the nervous system, and the pumps in the nervous system use about 60% of your body.  He's caloric intake of energy. So in other words, these pumps are really critically important in exchanging nutrition glucose amino acids and other minerals to allow them to transport in and out of the cell. So potassium is essential for building the pumps to allow these functions right here. They charge the cell electrically. So your cells have certain voltage that allows things to work and go in and out of the cell.  Create different energy. In fact, your energy that you have that controls controls. Your metabolism is controlled partly by this little pump. So it charges the cell electrically, it gives you energy.  It helps the muscles contract and relax because it allows calcium to go into the cell as well. So it controls the transport of calcium. Wow, interesting. So, if you're low on,  Something in this pump and these pumps aren't working. Your calcium. Is not going to relax the muscle. So you'll get muscle cramps. Okay? From potassium, but it's really calcium, but we can't fix it by giving a calcium. We have to give you a potassium. I'll get more into that. So the muscle needs this pump, the nerves to conduct electricity. Need this pump desperately and fluid the transport of fluid the, hydration of your body, is controlled by this pump, and your overall physical.  Okay. Now, since potassium is so hard to get in the diet because people don't realize how much they need and they're not eating enough vegetables. You can experience a set of symptoms that I'm going to describe to you and you might have some of these number one fatigue, fatigue can come from a potassium deficiency. Because if you're not an up, if you don't have enough, potassium your cells electrically are going to be way way, way down that you can't pump anymore. And that's why when people start eating more potassium foods that have more energy there.  Problem is if you try to take a potassium pill, it only is comprising about 40 mg. Maybe 90 mg. You need, forty seven hundred milligrams. So you'd have to have a whole bottle, the pills are not going to work and plus if you took that much potassium without the other minerals, you can throw it out of balance. So you want to get your potassium from food or food? Concentrates. So then we have, we have energy fatigue. We have muscle fatigue. So if you go up a flight of stairs,  And you feel like your legs are really heavy or you don't have the endurance. That is a potassium deficiency nerve if the nerve is tired. Your electrical impulses won't work. So you have arrhythmias, you'll have an alteration in heartbeat problems. Skip beats atrial fib. That's electrolyte deficiency. Okay fluid fluid retention swollen ankles. That's a potassium deficiency. What do doctors do they tell you to avoid salt?  A big mistake, they need you should increase potassium. Okay, and then overall Just Energy in the cell to work correctly. Okay? Now in the stomach, if you don't have enough potassium, you can't create the acid that you need to help digest protein and absorb other minerals. So again, the stump the potassium is needed for the stomach, the nerves the muscles for energy for fluid for hydration, all these things. Okay. So now that, you know that, let's talk about how you become deficient. Number one reason, is you  Don't have enough potassium in the diet. You need to consume 7 to 10 cups of vegetable or Salad a day to achieve this. Now, I enhance this with food. Concentrates, a lot of times if I can't get the quantity and I use my wheat grass juice powder. I take a teaspoon of that and that will give me a blend of a lot of potassium and magnesium. And a lot of other things to be able to spike that sodium potassium pump to boost my energy as well.  Vomiting diarrhea will also create a deficiency surgery. When you get a surgery. What happens is your potassium, just dumps because of the stress. And that's why they always give you a potassium IV because to replenish that potassium stress will also decrease potassium. So in let me just grab this right here. My favorite Sybil encyclopedia for endocrinology. We got right here adrenal stress, right?  Here, creates potassium loss. So, it's stress creates a loss of potassium through the urine. Okay. So sugar creates a deficiency of potassium. Why? Because insulin is the hormone that helps you absorb nutrients, right now. It also causes everything to go into fat, and if you have a problem with insulin, like insulin resistance, you can't pull glucose into the cell and that's why you're craving.  Oh, sweets, by the way, but see what insulin does. Its it only is acts as a trigger for the sodium potassium, pump to trigger the absorption of nutrients. So that doesn't get triggered. So you can't absorb things. So, by taking more potassium, you can actually decrease the need for insulin. And that's what I recommend for my diabetics. It's very difficult to fix diabetes without enough potassium. Okay, without enough vegetable. So if you have a lot of  Good, that'll do people, eat potassium. If you take potassium, it'll help with cravings and decrease your need for insulin diuretics, like like blood pressure. If you're low on potassium, your blood pressure will go up and you also have problems with calcium. Not moving in the correct places. So that's why they doctors, give you a diuretic to get rid of fluid and they give you a calcium channel blocker for high blood pressure, but they don't recommend potassium enough potassium. There's so many  any people that consume enough potassium in the blood pressure comes down. So diuretics will deplete your potassium. So the get rid of electrolytes, your blood pressure stays high salt, sodium, potassium. They always work in the balance. It's the reason I'm not talking about salt is that your body will tend to conserve salt, more than potassium. And also people, it's have a lot of extra salt in their diet. Like, naturally, just eat more salt than potassium. So, they're rarely deficient in Seoul. Okay, so salt too much.  All can deplete potassium alcohol, will deplete potassium. And the last one is ketogenic diets, which is interesting. So you go on a higher fat, low carb diet, what happens, you will deplete potassium. Thus, the reason why I tell you to consume more vegetable, when you do a high protein, high fat diet, so you can replenish the potassium and feel fine. Because a lot of times, you'll dump a lot of water from losing a lot of fat as well when you're burning fat.  Fat or you might feel fatigued or you might feel kind of like constipated by adding more potassium from the vegetable. It's not the fiber. It's potassium in that food that will help flush you out and keep the liver clean and help these pumps work a lot better. So I just wanted to kind of give you an idea of the most important electrolyte what it does and your body. Okay. That's what Delights do. And then also how you become deficient and what you need to do to correct this. Okay. Hope this helped and I will see  You in the next video?\",\n",

Click this link, share the video with others, particularly women that, you know,  No need this information because I personally know people who have four five even six UTIs a year and they are really damaging to life and health Etc. So let's get started. Number one, avoid factory-farmed meat. Now, you might know that organic could be more nutritious and have less pesticides, Etc. Maybe less GMOs, but did you know that factory farm meat contains small doses of antibiotics? That's right. Most of the antibiotics in  Erica are given to livestock conventional, chickens beef turkey, Etc eggs as well. When you consume factory farm meat or when you consume conventional meat in general, you are getting small doses of antibiotics. And what that does. Is it trains your microbes to become resistant when you have a UTI and it's severe you might need an antibiotic.  The antibiotics won't work as well with resistant bacteria. So avoid factory farm meet go for grass-fed, go for local, always ask about what the animals eat. And if you want to be sure. Sure go for organic. Best of all pasture-raised, organic grass-fed organic would be the ultimate wear loose clothing. This is probably obvious, but when you're dealing with a UTI, and you're dealing with bacteria, and then there can also be  Yeast as well, especially if you're on an antibiotic. You want to wear loose clothing. Particularly when you're dealing in the Crux of it, because very tight under garments and garments can create a warm moist environment, which is ideal for bacteria to thrive and that can cause UTIs and think about the urogenital system. There are a lot of ways to contaminate that area. So you want to be very  Very careful, when you're dealing with something. Some people that have recurrent UTIs know that.

Even if you're starting to burn a little bit, drink, a lot of water. Get that stuff out. You will do a great.  Neon urinary tract flush by drinking a quart of water as quickly as possible. Number four, consume probiotics, probiotics are critical to balance the gut when the gut is balanced. The urinary tract is balanced. If you have a UTI and you are on antibiotics, you definitely want to take a probiotic at the same time to prevent yeast infection or to prevent something systemic. I recommend a probiotic with SBO, s, or soil, based organisms.  It's because they are very effective at keeping yeast at Bay and can be highly antimicrobial. Look for a probiotic with fermented foods included and also eat some fermented foods. You're looking right now at yogurt, curd cheese. Kefir, kvass. Kombucha, cider vinegars are great, Probiotic foods are wonderful.

It stinks, but it doesn't stink nearly as bad as having a UTI because man is that painful consume a few cloves of garlic. A day, you can even consume up to  Seven cloves a day in food in t. Some people just chew it up and eat it. Not my taste, but you can do that. Garlic is very antimicrobial and antifungal get good sources of vitamin C. My favorite is lemon limes are great as well. Even though those seem acidic they will help to change the body's pH and are very effective for dealing with a UTI can also help flush the body out when consuming vitamin C. I recommend a whole food.  Vitamin C or a fermented form, but if you're someone who benefits from large quantities of vitamin C, I would get a vitamin C that has cofactors. Bioflavonoids Etc. And I think 1,000 milligrams a day is probably where I would go. I'm not a big 10,000. 20,000 mg. Vitamin C guy. I'd rather do it through Citrus and vitamin C. Rich foods, Peppers, broccoli, Etc. Lemongrass is amazing. I had some fresh lemongrass the other day. I put it in a cup and I poured,  Boiling water over it lemongrass infusion or t is amazing lemongrass essential oil consumed orally.

       " 'QA2_uA0qJls': \"That's two hours. I haven't had any protein or fat for the last four hours. So I'm not exactly fasting. I'm postprandial. I didn't take any insulin for the carbs that I had a couple hours ago. And what that means is that my blood sugar is high and it's high on purpose because I want to see what actually happens when I take this off. Reza. First of all, I want to say that I got with my prescription 90.  Little cartridges of a Fresca and each of those cartridges contains four units of insulin or at least the equivalent of four units of insulin. So if a frazzle works exactly the same or is exactly as strong for me as Humalog or novalog, then four units of a fragile. Fresno should lower my blood sugar by about the same amount as four units of Humalog or novalog. Now, I've heard that that's not  Really true. I've heard that a frazzle Works a little bit differently. So maybe four units of a Fresno doesn't exactly equal out to four units of Humalog or novalog. And that's why we're going to do some math and some experimentation and some waiting to to see how well it actually works. So the first thing I'm going to do is note the time. It's 7:37 p.m. Right now, and I'm just going to check my blood sugar. Oh, yeah, you know.  It just fell out a bunch of used test strips. I bet you've done that before. Oh, crap - trips. It's a good thing. I brought some more strips. Okay, so I'm going to check my blood here.  You can't really see what I'm doing. It's okay.  Here. Now. You can see what I'm doing. There we go. I myself will get a little bit of blood.  And we'll see what my blood sugar is. All right, so I'm 2277. So that's been pretty consistent for me, actually, for the last couple of hours. I've been between, I would say, 275 and 300. So I think my blood sugar is pretty stable right now. It's stabili high, but it's still stable. And so, what I'm going to  Next is figure out how to use this darn thing. So my first came in this like, oh wait. No, it's okay. So this is the inhaler. So there is an inhaler piece to the oppressor and there looks like there's some sort of cover on it. So I'm going to pop that cover off. So it looks like my mouth is supposed to go on that.  that's,  Okay, so I'm gonna read the instructions. God. This is just ridiculous. Like, who, who has the patience to read instructions, like throw those away and take out one of these guys. So this this is a package that  Means three insulin cartridges. One, two, three. And each cartridge is supposed to contain four units of insulin. So, let's see, what has to the pharmacist. Said. There's only one way to load a cartridge into the inhaler. So I guess that means I supposed to open the inhaler somehow.  Oh, okay. There you go. I opened it. So goes open like that. All right, so just setting this down for a second, so I can figure out how to end. This looks like I should just push it out.  Yeah, I guess so. All right, push it out.  It's like like a pill pack your shove, it out. I guess, all right, put this in my trusty box and okay. So wait a second. I need to do some math.  So my blood sugar's 275, my insulin sensitivity factor with Humalog and novolog is 65. So it's 65 times for.  260. So if this Africa is actually, as potent as Humalog or novalog, it should lower my blood sugar by 260 points. My blood sugar's only 275 so that would bring my blood sugar down to 15.  That sounds kind of bad. But that's okay because look have my trusty carbs with me. So we'll see what actually happens. I don't actually expect this to be as potent as Humalog or novalog. All right, so  I'm gonna thing, I guess. Can you see that? This is hard to see that loads in. Okay, then I guess when I close it, some sort of poking is supposed to happen. And I don't think I'm supposed to shake it up or anything. You know, I'm going to pause this video real quick and see if I can find some instructions online. All right, I can totally do this.  All right. What was I supposed to do again? Okay, so I am supposed to close this by snapping it down.  All right. I heard a snap.  Okay, so I'm supposed to hold this flap. I'm just going to look at the picture real quick.  Yeah, this looks pretty good. Okay. So now I remove the mouthpiece. I'll go this way. Okay.  It didn't really feel like anything. So, all right.  Set a timer for 5 minutes.  So, I think I'm supposed to probably remove this old cartridge and throw it away and I'll see you in five minutes because that's what I'm going to check my blood sugar next.  It hasn't been five minutes yet, but I wanted to mention that only two inhalers came with my set of 94 as a cartridges. So I guess I'm supposed to use this thing, like maybe 45 times and then use the other inhaler, 45 times. Or maybe I'm just supposed to start hoarding them because I'll probably like lose them or something. But anyway, I also wanted to mention that I feel kind of weird and it might  Because I held my breath for so long, but it hasn't been five minutes yet, and I can't imagine the aphorism would have worked this quickly. So I think I'm tracking up the weird feeling to just holding my darn breath for so long. So see you in a minute.  Okay, it's been almost there. It went. Okay, it has been five minutes. I was 275 when I first took the oppressor and so I'm going to check my blood sugar again. See what happened.  Do do, do do.  Wipe my hand down my pants to clean it off.  This is how we make do and we're diabetic. Okay, let's see. My blood sugar says this time.  268. Well, that doesn't really mean much. So I'm going to wait another five minutes and see what happens.  Set a timer for 5 minutes.  See you in five.  Okay, so I'm 10 minutes. Post a frozen inhale. Do your look? I'm just going to clean my finger on my shirt and I'm going to bulk it and oh, whoops. I should probably put a strip in the meter first. Hang on one second.  Okay, do do do do.  Blood. See, the blood. It's really grainy. Isn't it? Probably because of the lighting in my bedroom.  Okay.  Good.  Ten minutes later 269 not much of a difference. I'm still not all that impressed. Okay, so we're going to wait, five more minutes, and I'm going to test again and then I'm going to test in 15 Anchor up 15 minute increments after that. So we'll do one more. Five-minute break, one more test, then I'll test every 15 minutes after that. So it's been 10 minutes.  And nothing. Interesting has happened so far.  Hey, we're back. It's been 15 minutes total. Now since I took my first hit of my friends inhaler, and I'm going to check my blood sugar again.\",\n",

Unhealthy, white fat starts to look like metabolically active Brown fat. We know that exercise is very important effects on the heart and muscles but exercise is affecting every tissue in the body. And now we have some really strong data to show that fat which we think of, as sort of as the bad tissue can actually function in a positive way. Lori Good Year in Christian Stanford used both human and animal models to show that. As a result of regular exercise training, white fat increases, its metabolic activity transplanting that trained fat into a sedentary animal model also showed beneficial metabolic effects. We're seeing the effects of adipose tissue affecting skeletal muscle affecting Brown, adipose tissue, and having whole body affecting whole body, glucose homeostasis. The trained white fat had more than 1000 newly activated jeans, specializing in a rabbit.  Up metabolism. So this really shows that exercise really improves your overall metabolic health and that the effects of exercise which are typically attributed to skeletal, muscle can actually improve adipose tissue function. So even if we're not seeing changes in body mass, we're actually seeing that the fat when you exercise become more metabolically active and healthier being able to make white fat act like brown fat could have clinical implications through good fat, transplantation or fat changing pills. Another research area we have going on in the lab, right?  Out is to really try to identify proteins that are changing within the train fat proteins that are being secreted from this fat with the idea that these could potentially become targets for therapeutic treatments, but I always like to emphasize that that exercise training affects so many tissues throughout the body to make one pill. That's going to mimic all the effects of exercise. I think is very difficult to do but I think there are  Our possibilities to activate some of the proteins that we know are activated by exercise.

       " 'qNdoOd11Vi8': \"Was our second child and I realized that I was three hundred and twenty some odd pounds. And I had become very much out of shape, and my knees hurt my feet hurt, my whole body really hurt. And so, I decided that if I was going to be there for them and help those two boys grow into, you know, healthy well-adjusted young men that I needed to be in shape myself. I started slowly with my physical activity routine, and I walked for 45 minutes at a time, three days.  Days a week and gradually over time. I've increased that to 60 Minutes. I also added some free weights to what I did about 30 minutes, three sessions a week and a light routine. But nonetheless consistent my advice to another person who was getting started with to be just put one foot in front of the other and do what you can do walking. I think is the most natural thing you can do. It's something that you know, many of us, you know, can do and it doesn't require any equipment and it's what your body was created to do.  It's the most natural thing to do.  Before I started skating, I was in the weakest physical condition of my life. And I knew I needed to be healthier, but traditional exercise just didn't interest me and I was encouraged to take up a sport where I got joy. I always wanted to skate but I didn't think I could do it. I would skate once or twice a year and I'd get too tired. But the thing is, you need practice and each week. I got stronger and stronger at first. I just focused on the skating here, and I knew that on my off days.  From the rank, I needed straight training. So I added that in at home because I didn't have the money or the time for a gym membership after about a year of skating. I added in a dog into my life and we walk every day and that has helped my cardiovascular strength and we have so much fun together. There are recreational leagues and like every sport especially in Metro areas, go online and find something that you love and take lessons.  Yes, there's something out there for everyone.  I was in an automobile accident. I broke my neck and I was in ICU for about five weeks and lost more than 70 pounds. So I was 63, little over 110 pounds, nothing but skin and bone, so I just started trying to rebuild muscle with just a little weight workouts every day and then just slowly started building with a number of weight exercises. I would do and trying to do trying to work my abdominal somehow by  Holding my legs and pulling myself up to do a sit-up and slowly moved into more cardiovascular. Works workouts by just going on chair rides, pushing the chair for whatever distance. And soon as I got the hand cycle. It was pretty easy to make a Daily Commitment to that. Just really enjoy cycling itself and I'm motivated like all humans. It's human trait to want to do better and be better. And live is healthy. Life is possible.  It's hard when you have a lot of kids to do exercise, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure two years ago. Then I started walking 20 minutes a day. After that. I gradually started walking our with me and my grandkids, then I started doing it six times a week. I recently added weight and strength training to my routine.  I like walking and make me lose weight and keep my weight under control. Also, when I was walking that would clear my mind and then I feel better about myself.  I was literally a slug. The hardest thing in the world was to take that first step at 47 years old. I hadn't done anything. So I started slowly and just small steps walking in the neighborhood. I couldn't even make it to the end of my community. And now I'm to the point where I really enjoy it. I look forward to it, two three times a week. Just walking, anybody can do it. You don't need a gym. You can do this at home. You can do it anywhere.  It doesn't have to be a bad word. Now, not only has my energy increased but my family is really a family. We do this together and it's wonderful just find an activity. You like to do and get started. Believe me. The hardest step is the first one. Many people find that doing activities with their family, friends or coworkers. Helps them to get started. Try joining a regular walking group at work, sign up for a team sport. Or going to the gym with a friend, having a support network.  Network can help you stick with your program. I've also found that keeping a personal log or Journal of your activities, is an excellent way to stay committed, to being Physically Active, write your goals down. Mark, your activities on a calendar and keep track of your progress.  Okay, before we go. Any further, let's take a minute to review. The guidelines. They say that for substantial health benefits. The guidelines recommend that most adults get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity. Such as brisk walking.  Or 75 minutes a week of vigorous intensity aerobic activity such as jogging or an equivalent mix of both moderate and vigorous intensity aerobic activity each week. In addition to aerobic activities adult Americans should include at least two days a week of muscle-strengthening activities. You can get even more health benefits by working your way, up to 200 minutes, to 300 minutes, or more of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week.  But if you haven't been active in a while, start out by doing what you can once you feel comfortable slowly, add more time in days, many people's big mistake is to do too much too fast. Remember this is not a race. Walking is a great way to add physical activity to your life. Start with a 10-minute brisk walk twice a day. And if you feel like you can do more try to 15-minute walks a day before, you know it you can be up to 30 minutes a day, five days a week. And that's one way to meet the 150 minute total.  For moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. Now, just put in your two days of muscle-strengthening activities that work all seven, major muscle groups and you're meeting all the minimum guidelines after a couple of months. If you feel ready, instead of doing only moderate level activities, like brisk, walking replace them with more. Vigorous types of aerobic activity, like, jogging do what works best for you, but always start with moderate intensity activities and then add ones that require more vigorous effort. Little by little the  The thing is to find activities you like to do so that you'll stick with them. Sometimes getting started is the hardest part of meeting. The physical activity guidelines, but all it takes is just a little desire and commitment to take that first step. I'm Dave patania, please. Look at our series of videos that can help you get active healthy and happy.\",\n",
       " 'QRLZwXL6w1c': \"Is the amount of glucose in the blood by binding to insulin receptors embedded in the cell membrane of various insulin response of tissues like muscle cells and adipose tissue. When activated, the insulin receptors causes vesicles, containing glucose transporter that are inside the cell to fuse with the cell membrane allowing glucose to be transported into the cell.  Glucagon does exactly the opposite. It raises the blood glucose levels by getting the liver to generate new molecules of glucose from other molecules and also break down glycogen into glucose so that I can all get dumped into the blood. Diabetes mellitus is diagnosed when blood glucose levels, get too high and this is seen among ten percent of the world population. There are two types of diabetes type 1 and type 2. And the main difference between them is the underlying mechanism that causes blood glucose levels to rise.  About ten percent of people with diabetes, have type 1 and the remaining 90% of people have type two.  So let's start with type 1, diabetes mellitus. Sometimes just called type 1 diabetes in this situation. The body doesn't make enough insulin. The reason this happens is that in type 1 diabetes. There's a Type 4 hypersensitivity response or a cell mediated immune response where a person's own T cells attack the pancreas as a quick review. Remember that the immune system has T cells that react to all sorts of antigens which are usually small peptides polysaccharides or lipids and  Some of these antigens are part of our own body's cells. It doesn't make a lot of sense to allow T cells that attack, our own cells to hang around until there's this process to get rid of them called self tolerance with type 1 diabetes. A genetic abnormality causes a loss of self tolerance among T cells. That specifically Target the beta cell. Antigens.  Losing self tolerance means that these T cells are allowed to recruit other immune cells and coordinate an attack on these beta cells.  Losing beta cells means less insulin and less. Insulin means that glucose piles up in the blood because it can't enter the body cells.  One really important set of genes involved in the regulation of the immune response is the human. Leukocyte antigen system or HLA system. Although it's called a system. It's basically this group of genes on chromosome, 6 that encode, the major histocompatibility complex or MHC, which is a protein that's extremely important in helping the immune system recognize foreign molecules, as well as maintaining self tolerance.  MHC is like the serving platter that antigens are presented to immune cells. Interestingly people with type 1, diabetes often have specific HLA genes in common with each other. One called HLA dr3, and another called HLA dr4, but this is just a genetic clue, right? Because not everyone with HLA dr3 and HLA. Dr4 develops, diabetes.  In diabetes mellitus type 1, destruction of beta cells usually starts early on in life. But sometimes up to 90% of the beta cells are destroyed before symptoms crop up.  For clinical symptoms of uncontrolled diabetes. That all sound similar are polyphagia glycosuria, polyuria and polydipsia. Let's go through them one by one. Even though there's a lot of glucose in the blood. It can't get into the cells which leaves cells start for energy. So in response adipose tissue starts breaking down fat called lipolysis and muscle tissue starts breaking down proteins. Both of which result in weight loss for someone with uncontrolled diabetes.  This catabolic State leaves people. Feeling hungry, also known as polyphagia faiza, means eating and poly means a lot.  Now, with high glucose levels, that means that when blood gets filtered through the kidneys, some of it starts to spill into the urine called glycosuria, lycos refers to glucose and urea refers to the urine.  Since glucose is osmotically. Active, water tends to follow it. Resulting in an increase in urination or polyuria Pauly again. Refers to a lot in urea, again, refers to urine.  Finally, because there's so much urination people with uncontrolled, diabetes become dehydrated and thirsty, or polydipsia. Poly means a lot and Dipsy amines thirst. Even that people with diabetes aren't able to produce their own insulin. They can still respond to insulin. So treatment involves lifelong insulin therapy to regulate their blood glucose levels and basically enable their cells to use glucose.  One really serious complication with type 1, diabetes is called diabetic ketoacidosis or dka to understand it. Let's go back to the process of lipolysis where fats, broken down into free fatty acids. After that happens. The liver turns the fatty acids into Ketone bodies, like acetoacetic acid in beta hydroxy, butyric acid acid, or acetic acid is a keto acid because it has a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group, beta-hydroxybutyrate gas.  On the other hand, even though it's still one of the Ketone bodies isn't technically a keto acid since its Ketone group has been reduced to a hydroxyl group.  These Ketone bodies are important because they can be used by cells for energy. But they also increase the acidity of the blood, which is why it's called ketoacidosis.  The blood becoming really acidic can have major effects throughout the body. Patients can develop Cosmo respiration, which is a deep and labored breathing as the body tries to move carbon dioxide out of the blood in an effort to reduce its acidity.  Cells also have a transporter that exchanges hydrogen ions or protons H+ for potassium when the blood gets acidic, it's by definition loaded with protons that gets sent into the cells. While potassium gets sent into the fluid outside the cells.  Another thing to keep in mind is that in addition to helping glucose enter cells, insulin stimulates, the sodium-potassium atpase has, which helped potassium get into cells. And so without insulin more, potassium stays in the fluid outside, the cells  Both of these mechanisms lead to increased potassium in the fluid outside the cells which quickly makes it into the blood and causes. Hyperkalemia. The potassium is then excreted. So over time, even though the blood potassium levels remain high overall stores of potassium in the body, which includes potassium inside cells starts to run low.  Patients will also have a high anion gap, which reflects a large difference in the unmeasured negative and positive ions. In the serum largely due to this buildup of Keto acids.  Diabetic ketoacidosis can happen even in people who have already been diagnosed with diabetes and currently have some sort of insulin therapy in states of stress, like an infection, the body releases epinephrine which in turn stimulates the release of glucagon too much glucagon. Can tip the delicate, hormonal balance of glucagon and Insulin in favor of elevating blood sugars and can lead to the Cascade of events. We just described increase glucose in the blood loss of glucose in the urine loss of water.  Hydration and in parallel and need for alternate energy, generation of Ketone bodies. And ketoacidosis, interestingly. Both Ketone bodies break down into acetone and Escape is a gas by getting breathe out the lungs, which gives a sweet fruity smell to a person's breath in general, though. That's the only sweet thing about this illness which also causes nausea vomiting and if severe enough, mental status changes and acute cerebral edema,  Treatment of a dka episode, involves giving plenty of fluids which helps with dehydration insulin, which helps lower blood glucose levels, and replacement of electrolytes, like potassium, all of which help to reverse the acidosis. Now, let's switch gears and talk about type 2 diabetes, which is where the body makes insulin, but the tissues don't respond as well to it. The exact reason why cells don't respond isn't fully understood essentially.  See the bodies providing the normal amount of insulin, but the cells don't move their glucose Transporters to their membrane in response, which remember is needed for glucose to get into the cell. These cells. Therefore are said to have an insulin resistance.  Some risk factors for insulin resistance, our obesity lack of exercise in hypertension and the exact mechanisms are still being explored. For example, an excess of adipose tissue or fat is thought to cause the release of free fatty acids and so-called adipose coins, which are signaling molecules that can cause inflammation, which seems related to insulin resistance.  However, many people that are obese are not diabetic. So genetic factors probably play a major role as well. We see this, when we look at twin studies. We're having a twin with type 2, diabetes, increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, completely independent of other environmental, risk factors.  In type 2 diabetes since tissues, don't respond as well to normal levels of insulin, the body ends up producing more insulin in order to get the same effect and move glucose out of the blood. They do this through beta cell hyperplasia, which is an increased number of beta cells and beta cell hypertrophy, or they actually grow in size all in this attempt to pump out more insulin.  This works for a while. And by keeping insulin levels higher than normal blood glucose levels, can be kept normal called normal glycemia. Now along with insulin beta cells, also secrete islet, amyloid polypeptide, or amylin. So, while beta cells are cranking out insulin, they also secrete an increased amount of amylin overtime, mammal and builds up and Aggregates in the islets. This beta cell compensation, though isn't sustainable and over time those max out beta cells  Exhausted, and they become dysfunctional and undergo hypertrophy and get smaller as well as hypoplasia and die off.  As beta cells are lost in insulin levels, decrease glucose levels in the blood, start to increase and patients develop hyperglycemia, which leads to similar clinical signs that I mentioned before. Like polyphagia glycosuria, polyuria and polydipsia, but unlike type 1, diabetes. There's generally some circulating insulin in type 2 diabetes from the beta cells that are trying to compensate for the insulin resistance. This means that the insulin glucagon balance is such that diabetic ketoacidosis.  Osis doesn't usually develop, having said that a complication called hyperosmolar, hyperglycemic state or HHS is much more common in type 2. Diabetes than in type 1 diabetes, and it causes increased plasma osmolarity, due to extreme dehydration and concentration of the blood to help understand this.\",\n",
       " 'QSXWXPWUWEc': \"Diabetes frequently asked and question part 2.  Five, injecting with an insulin pen before you inject, make sure there is enough insulin in the cartridge for your injection and check that the expiry date on the cartridge has not passed, screw on the needle. Before each injection. Make sure that your pan is giving insulin by dialing, one or two units, and holding a pen, upright, press the plunger. You should see a drop of insulin on your needle. Tip after the plunger is pushed in, leave the needle, in the skin, for at least  And S. This will allow the last drops of insulin to be completely injected after. You have finished, remove the tip and put it in a needle, disposing bin.  6, how do I inject?  If your nurse has asked you to inject, using a skin fold do so by taking a clean fold of skin between your thumb and index finger, making sure that you only lift the skin and not the muscle beneath quickly. Push the needle, straight into the skin fold, as far as it will go and with your thumb on top of the plunger smoothly. Inject, all the insulin. You must continue to hold a skin fold throughout all the injection of the insulin. When finished remove the needle slowly and only then release the skin fold.  Seven. Where do I am Jack? My insulin. The vast areas where to inject our stomach upper arms thighs. Buttocks, insulin is absorbed in different speeds, depending on where you inject. So in order for your insolent to work the same way from one day to the next always inject in the same area at the same time. Ask your diabetes specialist nurse, which injection areas are best for you and write down the time of the day for  Should them ate how, and why do I rotate my injection sites?  It is important that you don't keep injecting your insulin in the same place change sides. Using, for instance, your right thigh. One day and you're left by the following day and vice versa. Each time you inject, Anna site. Make sure that you don't inject in the same place as the last time, move the location of the injection by about a fingers width, from the place you use the previous time. There are side rotation guides available to help you, rotate your injections. Ask your nurse if you want to use them.  If you always inject in the same place and her reuse, your needles more than once, your sites may become red Soren lumpy. This is what we call it the dystrophy or lipo lipo, scan develop anywhere on your body. Where you inject insulin injected into a lipo, may not work properly and it may affect your blood sugar level. This is why it's very important to always rotate your injection sites, and change your needle after each injection 9  Well, I always need insulin. In your case, you have what is called type 1 diabetes. This means that your body completely stops making the insulin it needs to work properly and injecting insulin is the only way to replace what your body no longer makes. You may have heard about a person having diabetes and taking pills, but it's not same diabetes. That's what we call. Type 2, diabetes.  10, what makes your blood sugar? Level rise and fall?  Looking after your diabetes isn't just about insulin injections. You should eat regular meals and avoid too many sugary foods and sweet drinks doing regular exercise. Several times a week will also help you to balance your blood sugar level. Controlling your diabetes is all about getting the balance right between insulin food and exercise. Imagine a submarine, has your blood sugar level. When you eat or drink, your blood sugar level rises when you inject insulin,  On your blood sugar level Falls. If you exercise your blood sugar level Falls even faster. This is why balancing the amount of insulin food and exercise are so important. Your blood sugar level should not be allowed to go too high or too low by doing regular blood sugar. Level tests. Your insulin dose can be adjusted to keep your blood sugar level as healthy as possible.\",\n",

Are you tired of taking medications? Medications is definitely the popular way of treating peripheral neuropathy. Here's the problem. If nothing changes, the nothing changes, both the doctor and the patient are caught in a terrible cycle. The peripheral neuropathy is treated the condition gets worse. They prescribe medications. The condition gets worse. They use the maximum dosage of medications. The condition gets worse, then they resort to using heavy-duty pain medications that  Gets worse. Then. The patient is completely debilitated or disabled. And as a last resort, there's a Tatian a terrible cycle, indeed.  It is sad. This country isn't a health care crisis, heart disease, diabetes and neuropathy account for 75% of doctor's office visits.  Do you know what the leading causes of death are? Number one is heart disease. Number two is cancer. Can you guess what? Number three is prescription medication prescription medications are the third leading cause of death in the United States. Over 100,000. People die each year from properly prescribed medications.  Remember each medication is accompanied by a host of negative side effects. Here are some popular medications used to treat peripheral, neuropathy, Cymbalta Neurontin, Lyrica as well as opiates for the pain. You can see the side effects range from constipation to diarrhea, too, fatigued to headache, to nausea to weight, gain to vomiting. Now, Pleasant.  Now Neurontin is the most widely prescribed drug for peripheral neuropathy. Generally, speaking about 20% of all drugs are prescribed off-label. What that means is it's about 20% of the time. Drugs are prescribed, not for the original purpose that they were created for now. The use of Gabapentin also called, Neurontin has become. So widespread, that is many as 90% of the prescriptions are for off-label, use such as for the treatment of peripheral neuropathy.  Again, here's the problem.  Neurontin or Gabapentin is not FDA approved for neuropathy treatment. The FDA has approved a rotten for seizure disorders. This is a typical course of medication. First one pill at 300 milligrams. Then two pills 600 milligrams for pills, 1200 mg. 8 pills, 2400 mg and on. And on remember, as the quantity goes up. So do the side effects.  It's interesting that we treat our cars a lot better than we treat our bodies. When our car shows a sign that something's wrong such as the check engine light. What do we do? We immediately set an appointment to go into the mechanic or the dealership and have it repaired. We don't always do. So, with our bodies, when our body gives off signs and symptoms, that things are wrong. Oftentimes. We cover them up, which would be the same as taking a piece of tape and just covering up the check engine light. No one would do that, right?  Well, your body has signs and your body's alarm our feelings like burning cold prickling, poking aching, numb, vibrating feet. These are all signs that the alarm in your body is going off telling you that there's a problem underneath.  So, let's delve into peripheral neuropathy. But this is a great example. What do you see here? Are frayed electrical wire when the outside protective coating of the electrical wire gets withered away in the wires exposed, you get a shock. Have you ever felt shocks in your feet or in your hands?  There are different types of nerves. There are many different types that give off different types of Sensations. Some nerves give off, sensations of vibration. Some cold hot light, touch heavy touch position sense, for balance pressure, all these different things over time pressure on these different types of nerves causes them to give off abnormal Sensations. It progresses slowly for sometimes two or even five years, but at some point, it has what we call the dropping off point.  Dramatically gets worse, and it's very difficult to treat.  There are different types of nerve fibers in your body, as we just showed, when you have problems with large fibers balance and coordination become a problem loss of balance and coordination, and the need for walking assistance such as canes, Walker's, even sometimes a wheelchair. When those fail, the big problem is that it falls increase. When you have large fiber problems, these put our seniors and anyone who falls lives at risk did.  You know, that one out of three adults over age 65 experience, a fall each year and that 10% of all falls are fatal. The problem is less than fifty percent of seniors talk to their healthcare provider after having a fall.  Another type of nerve fiber that gets effective. Which is very, very, very undesirable would be the small nerve fibers. This makes it so that the patient's don't feel when their feet are cut or injured. If you experience. Numbness, tingling, pinching sharp, deep stabs or electrical shocks and buzzing. Those are signs of small, fiber problems.  Ulcers and cuts, that don't heal that form on the feet, come from small fiber symptoms. The problem is, we just don't feel those Sensations in the injuries occur over and over and over again. Deep Cuts, broken toes and damage just occurs repeatedly and it never gets a chance to heal.  If you have a problem with C fibers, you may experience burning pain, C fibers. Let your brain know that the normal temperature of your feet is. In fact normal. Have you felt freezing or Burning Sensations in your feet or it possibly in your hands. Those are damaged C fibers.  Unfortunately, peripheral neuropathy is the number one cause of amputations and diabetics when something called nitric oxide is decreased in the blood. Then we get a decrease blood flow to the nerves, in the skin, when you get decreased blood flow to the nerves in the skin that decreases their healing times when they have ulcers and cuts on them. This leads to infections and ulcerations, which ultimately lead to something called gangrene gangrene is when the tissue is actually dying in writing off.  In order to save the client's life.  This can eventually lead to amputation.  Not very desirable choice. Is it? So what are the other choices? Well classically. It's to go to the primary doctor and get drugs to mask the symptoms. And then it's on to getting referred to the neurologist for nerve testing, more medications.  Let me ask you. Have you ever heard of the word, Insanity? Insanity means doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results. That is true. Insanity.  Have you heard this? Nothing can be done. And you have to live with it?  We feel that restoring nerve function and health from the inside out as the best approach here. We take a comprehensive approach to treating peripheral neuropathy and feel strong that the best outcomes are a result of addressing the body as a whole, the critical and unique part of our treatment plan involves a complex supplemental program that enables all our natural vasodilators to help put the body back into an Optimum position to heal itself the body.  Just needs a little help.  Let's look back at the nerve pathology chart at the top. We see the healthy nerve with healthy, blood supply. And the middle. We see disease to blood vessels that are swollen inflamed and constricting that end up shriveling, and then causing the nerve to shrivel and wither away as well. Remember, as a nerve Withers away. It gives off those bad Sensations associated with neuropathy.  Another side effect of neuropathy is what we call hypoxia. Now, hypoxia means a lack of oxygen. Oftentimes. We see hypoxia of the legs and the feet.  When a normal artery becomes thickened, and swollen and inflamed, it's then prone to havin plaque buildup on it. This leads to poor circulation and toxic buildup. Remember circulation, not only brings good, things like oxygen and nutrients into an area. It takes the bad things away with poor circulation, comes toxic buildup.  So, our nutrition protocols for addressing peripheral neuropathy are as follows.  The entire program is founded on nitric oxide and it acting as a natural vasodilator. Now again to be clear, vasodilation means it opens up. The arteries arteries are long tubes of smooth muscle. Nitric oxide causes these muscles to Simply relax with no side effects. You know, what happens is in our diet, we get increased sugars and starches, those bind to nitric oxide and they reduce its  In C, then we have problems with circulation. The typical American diet is of high, sugar, high starches and this creates decreased blood flow within the microvessels are, that little tiny arteries, which feed the nerves that are involved, with neuropathy sugars and starches. Also, create inflammation in the artery walls, which further decreases blood flow.  Here's a great drawing of vasodilation on the left. We see a constricted tightened artery. Not much room for blood on the right. We see an artery under the influence of nitric oxide. The artery smooth muscle is relaxed and dilated. That's a great circulation.  In 1998. The Nobel Prize was awarded for research and work in cardiovascular health using nitric oxide.  In addition to nitric oxide are supportive nutrition is as follows.  We offer a customized support of nutritional program that allows your body to actually take advantage of the effects of nitric oxide. Now, under the influence, in the effects of nitric oxide, the things necessary for healing can get to the tissues that need to heal the\",\n",

In other words, if you're eating more calories than you're burning off with your muscles, every day that X, those extra calories are stored as fat and they're put in the muscle cells, there put between your muscle cells there, put inside.  Your liver as fat, their put inside the in the abdominal organs inside of the in around those organs, as lay down as fat. And as you accumulate more and more of this fatty tissue, your tissues start to become resistant to insulin. And they essentially say to incent look, we have all of the calories that we can handle. We don't want anymore. And so they resist the effects of insulin and because of that blood sugar doesn't get into the into the cells like it did before and so it stays  Doubt in the bloodstream and so the pancreas seeing the blood sugar rise, puts out more and more insulin to can't go anywhere because the cells were saying, no, that's correct. So insulin in try it tries to get in so to speak. That's right, and it's let in for a certain amount of time. We've got a couple Graphics that help illustrate your point here about why we should have those levels lower. Let's look at those. Well, you know, the thing to keep in mind, is that as your insulin level goes up.  You're raising a hormone that promotes cell division cell growth. And so that can lead to a greater risk of cancer. And so here, we see that individuals who are taking in foods that promote insulin levels. So these are the high glycemic. That's right. That's what researchers. That's the term. We use for foods that are most likely to raise your insulin level. So the high glycemic index here. It says 1.7. What's that mean? That means that people that eat food.  That are very good at raising your blood sugar. Very good at raising your insulin level. They have a 70% greater risk of colon cancer. And so here we here, we see that individuals were eating foods that raise the insulin level more than other Foods, more than foods that are much less likely to raise blood sugar levels, much less likely to raise insulin levels. Those individuals with these high insulin levels, and eating foods that are high in blood sugar, raising ability.  They have more cancer. Okay. So the glycemic index of a food is important. Tell me a little bit. What that means a little bit more. I'm not sure I'm picking up on that. Exactly. What they basically do, is they give test subjects who are wealthy are not wealthy but healthy and without disease, they give them a certain food and they test their blood sugar before they eat it and they test their blood sugar a certain amount of time after they eat it and then they give them another food and they test their blood sugar again, and they find out which  Food, really make a go of it, really makes it go up. And what you have to remember is most of us think? Okay. We eat a food, a blood sugar goes up, but they may not realize that as the blood sugar goes up. So the insulin level goes up and if you have a food that greatly raises blood sugar levels, you're going to get an even more robust elevation in your insulin level and they have been there. If they've seen in study after study, that these kind of foods that are great at raising, your blood sugar are also great at  Using insulin level and promoting cancer in this case, 70% greater risk of colon cancer. So one reason than to keep it low is to make sure that we're not setting ourselves up for cancers. That's right. Insulin resistance. When you're a carrying extra weight, especially in the midsection, you're not doing much with your muscles. Their insulin resistant, insulin resistance in your tissues leads to a high blood, insulin level and that leads to higher risk of cancer. That's another reason we have another graphic here, too.  You know, about a reason to keep it low. What's another reason we want to keep it low? Well, another reason to keep the insulin level low is that researchers have also discovered Doctor Who and his colleagues at the Harvard School of Public Health found that individuals who were eating the foods again, most likely to raise your blood sugar foods that are that raise the blood sugar, most easily into the greatest extent. They have the greatest risk of our number one killer coronary heart disease. In fact, they have almost  threefold greater risk of the nation's. Number one killer than individuals who are eating Foods least likely to raise your blood. So that 2.77 is like 3 and the other ones one. So exactly. So that much greater. So you have the risk of heart disease. That's when you have the risk of cancer. These are reasons to make sure the insulin is as low as it can be. But haven't I heard that? If the insulin gets too low, you pass out. Well, if you're on a medication and  And you're not eating enough of the calories to match that insulin that you've just injected. Yes, you can bottom out your blood sugar. No question about it. This isn't talking about that you're talking about overall. We're talking about foods that can actually increase your insulin level because they are very good at raising your blood sugar level. I see what's the best way to lower my insulin level. Well the best way to lower your insulin level is frankly to find a program that will help you to lose weight in the  the short term but also a program that you can stay on for the long term, you know, there's lots of programs out there that will help you to lose weight. But how long can you live with them? How long can you, for example, live with a diet? That's essentially very low in fiber leads to constipation and fatigue and you're talking about the, the low-carb diets. Absolutely. And so you want to find a diet. That's why we have success, the Lifestyle Center of America. Because individuals come and they find that they can actually  Eat foods that are not only nourishing, but tasty and fact, they can actually eat more in many cases than what they were eating before. Because the beans, if they're cooked, the whole grains, if they're cooked fruits and vegetables, those for foods are 80% water. And so if you're putting into your stomach four cups of food, that's 80% water. It's going to be very difficult to gain. Weight fact, people are going to lose on that program and  It's a program that can stay on. So the most powerful way is to do what again, eat Foods as grown. Is that what you're saying Foods? As growing plant Foods as grown, just as they come from nature and you will be able to, for example, increase perhaps the amount of volume that you're eating, but the calories will be reduced. Now they foods with the lowest calorie density. Yeah. I was going to ask that. What are the foods with the with the lowest? Lowest calorie density are vegetables, vegetables, vegetables will only give you three hundred calories.  That's it. Eh six cups of vegetables. So broccoli, broccoli cauliflower, kale carrots. Onions, celery. You name it though. Tomato a fruit or a vegetable. As I understand it. It's a fruit but you know, it acts like a vegetable. Okay, but the reality is, you can eat vegetables. And we would encourage individuals who want to lose weight to make that the focus of your noon meal make that at least 50% two cups of vegetables.  At lunch. Because again, very low in calorie density. Other one is fruits and fruits are again 80% water low in calorie density. Now, you want to choose the right fruits, otherwise fruits can raise your insulin level more than it is. So what are the right kind of fruits? Well, the right kind of fruits are asked what we term at the Lifestyle Center of America, Northern fruits. Northern fruits. Northern fruits are things that grow primarily and Washington, and  Again, we're talking about peaches peaches, pears hair apples. That's correct, plums, berries, cherries things that have a pit that grow up north and all those berries. What are the ones that are not? Well, the things that tend to raise blood sugar and watermelon insulin melons absolutely melons are high in sugar low in fiber. Now, it's something they have fiber, but it's not much of it. So, you know, that's fine for a Sunday picnic, but if you're carrying extra,  Await and you're sedentary or certainly, if you have diabetes, melons aren't something, you want to be doing a lot of get out those delicious McIntosh apples and that's exactly, right. So what are the foods that that we need to avoid? What types of foods raise insulin? The most besides melons. You have a Graphic on this, I think. Well foods that raise insulin levels. Most, you know, doctor will at his colleagues. Again, at the Harvard School of Public Health. I've actually looked at, you know, thousands of nurses, thousands of health professionals and found out  Do you know which of these are most likely to get diabetes and what are they eating?

       " 'qYBou4o9vNI': \"Welcome to the University of Rochester, Pathology video series. This video reviews the normal histology of the pancreas.  Using the Nano zoom digital pathology slides available in the U of R histology folder. We will examine the microscopic anatomy of the pancreas. Feel free to locate slide 66 and follow along. As we explore at the pancreas cross section.  The majority of the pancreas is composed of acinar cells, which comprise the exocrine pancreas the endocrine functioning islets of langerhans. Confirm that we are looking at the pancreas and not the parotid which lacks endocrine function.  First, let's examine the histology of the exocrine. Pancreas these triangular or pyramidal secretary cells are called acini and comprise more than 80% of the adult pancreas. The nuclei are basally located and the cytoplasm is very granular. The granules differ between the apical and basil cytoplasm, 's and the granularity is the result of a high density of organelles.  Here is a compact islet of langerhans with well defined borders, and course, speckled chromatin compact islets make up the majority of the endocrine pancreas. A small fraction of the total islet cells are more diffusely spread through the acini.  In neonates islets of langerhans, comprise about 20% of the pancreas, but only one to two percent of the total organ in adults.  There are four types of Endocrine cells, beta cells, alpha cells, Delta cells, and PP cells. Each is present in varying concentrations and with distinct functionality, but it is not possible to discern the differences between the cells at this level of microscopic staining beta cells tend to be located centrally in the islets and may have larger nuclei PP cells are very rare and make up the majority of diffuse islet cells.  The pancreas contains a large amount of connective tissue, the cept. I divide lobes of the pancreas.  We see arteries veins and capillaries throughout. The connective tissue here is an artery and vein and more connective tissue in the center of the image in the lower right of the frame. We see our first large. Pancreatic duct.  The pancreatic ducts are characterized by columnar mucus. Epithelium. They have round nuclei which are located on the basal layer.  Here is a closer image of a duct. The larger ducks have more rectangular columnar epithelium. Whereas Ducks within a cenar lobules contain shorter more cuboidal epithelium. This inter lobular duct. Epithelium is a transition between the columnar and cuboidal epithelium.  Here is an example of a larger duct. The epithelium is more columnar than cuboidal.  Here is an intercalated duct as an intra lobular, pancreatic duct. Intercalated ducts are found among the acinar cells rather than being surrounded by connective tissue. The smallest of the pancreatic ducts, intercalated ducts have cuboidal epithelium.  In review pancreas histology, may be divided into acini islets and Ducks. Acinar cells. Make up the majority of the pancreatic globules and are densely packed with organelles and basal nuclei. There are four types of islet cells, but they are essentially indistinguishable through H&E staining. The pancreatic ducts are lined by epithelium, which varies from cuboidal to columnar.  This concludes our review of normal pancreatic histology.\",\n",

First of all, the trace mineral, is a mineral needed in very small amounts, usually below 100 mg. But the unique factor of this mineral is it enhances the function of insulin so allows insulin to work better. Now, what condition do you think that would be good for you guessed? It insulin resistance, because what happens when the cells start resisting insulin, this the feedback loops that go to  The pancreas then tell the pancreas to make more insulin because it's not getting through. So people with insulin resistance have about five to seven times more insulin than a normal person. So, chromium allows this insulin to penetrate the cell better improving insulin resistance. Now, there's two other minerals that can or two other elements that can do that. One is potassium and B1. So now we got chromium.  Would be a really good combination to help someone with a blood sugar issue. It's actually called the glucose tolerance Factor because it improves the tolerance of glucose.

The glucagon procedure with you to ensure that you have the skills to perform this emergency medication administration store the diabetes, emergency plan and glucagon kit in a location that is easily accessible During a severe low blood sugar event. Be sure that staff members who have regular contact with the student know where the medication is stored.  The glucagon kit contains a vial with powder and a syringe with liquid diluent.  Be sure to check the expiration date on the medication package. Remember to keep Health Care information, confidential.  Procedure for medication administration, identify that symptoms of a severe low blood sugar reaction are present. And that based on the child's diabetes, emergency plan, medication needs to be given.  Call for assistance. Ask that another school staff person call 911 or Emergency Medical Services.  Explain the procedure to the child at his, or her level of understanding.  Assemble supplies and place on a clean surface.  Review the students diabetes emergency action plan.  Check the glucagon kit and order to be sure it is for the right child.  The right medication.  The right dose.  Being given at the right time.  And being given by the right route. Also check to ensure the medication has not expired. Wash, your hands of possible.  Put on gloves.  Remove the glucagon vial and syringe containing the liquid or diluents from the case.  Remove the gray cap from the vial.  Remove the cap from the syringe.  Place the needle tip in the center, top of the vial and slowly push the deal. You went from the syringe into the vial.  Gently swirl the vial with a syringe still in the vial until the solution is clear. This takes about 10 to 15 seconds.  Turn the vial upside down, being sure that the needle does not fall out of the vial.  Pull the solution into the syringe, by pulling back on the plunger as you withdraw. The ordered amount of glucagon solution.  If present remove air bubbles by tapping on the outside of the syringe and expelling the air, or by pushing the dose back into the vial and pulling back on the plunger again.  Recheck, the five rights again, checking the glucagon kit and order to be sure it is for the right child, the right medication, the right dose being given at the right time and being given by the right route.  Identify the location buttock thigh or arm for the injection, cleanse, the injection site with an alcohol wipe.  Insert the needle into the skin at a 90 degree angle.  Slowly inject the solution.  Remove syringe.  Put the used syringe in the carrying case. Closed the carrying case to avoid a possible needle stick injury, apply pressure, using the alcohol wipe and gently massage injection site.  If the student is not lying on their side move, the student to a side-lying position because vomiting often follows the injection of glucagon. If needed ask another person for assistance.  If alone with student and you have not already called 911 or Emergency Medical Service do so now.  Monitor, the students arousal pulse and respirations if breathing stops begin rescue, breaths.  If breathing and heartbeat, stop, begin CPR.  Maintain a side-lying position to prevent aspiration due to vomiting. Once Rescue Squad arrives inform them of medication administered including type of medication dose and time send along glucagon kit along with used dose dispose of all used materials. And proper receptacles, remove gloves and wash hands.  Follow up with the parent or guardian and healthcare provider as needed.  Document the event and administration of glucagon including time day dosage, and site of administration.\",\n",
       " '2cf5hValM': \"It is time. We have arrived at the final Conflict, the Battle Royale, a fight, to the well, hopefully not death, but a big fight. Anyway, it only seems fitting that we spend this our last episode of anatomy. And physiology talking about one of your body's last-ditch efforts to defend itself at all costs. This is what happens when all the other fail-safes have failed your skin and mucous membranes did what they could is physical barriers against infection and your humoral immune response cranked out antibodies in an effort to keep your interstitial spaces healthy. When those  Items weren't enough. Your cells themselves were breached and pathogens and abnormalities began to run amok where antibodies could not get to them. Now. It becomes the business of your cell mediated or cellular immune response. And that's where stuff gets real where cell fights cell and we're heroes. Look like t-lymphocytes, these lymphocytes known on the streets as T cells go after body cells that have been hijacked by things like viruses or bacteria or become cancerous. He sells cause inflammation, activate, macrophages, get other T-cells fired up and generally  Lead much of the immune response, which is important because of all the ways in this course, that we have described how you could die too. That we have neglected to mention our what happens if your body completely fails to protect itself and what happens if your immune system goes Rogue and attacks your own healthy cells, but even when they're functioning, well, some of your immune cells are careening around your body like miniature biological versions of Mad. Max War boys, amped up on signaling chemicals scouring, the terrain for hostiles and covered from top to bottom in the dismembered parts of the enemies that they have Bank wished around.  To protect all of the tissues and organ systems that we've been talking about for the past 46 weeks, and these guys play for keeps.  If there are cells in your body that look and act like they're from some post-apocalyptic hellscape. It's gotta be the cells in your immune system. Aside from the fact that they go around literally eating their enemies and have names, like natural Killers. Some of these cells are dressed for the part to specifically, they go around wearing parts of the organisms. They've killed. So others can see them. Sounds a little bit messed up, but we're talking life and death here. The stakes are high. This kind of behavior occurs both in your innate immune response, and he required response. We've already talked about how in the innate response.  Response when a phagocyte sees a suspicious character, it engulfs it and kills it. Right? But we didn't get into before is that during its attack? The phagocyte actually breaks the pathogen into tons of tiny molecules and then proudly displays those broken bits in grooved proteins on its outer membrane. These proteins are called major histocompatibility, complexes or mhcs and there are a lot like how Vlad the Impaler decorated his front yard with the bodies of his skewered enemies or how a battle crazed Warrior might show off a necklace made of knucklebones gazelles from both your innate and adaptive brake.  Just do this grizzly accessorizing like it's their job. They are referred to as professional antigen presenting cells, which might make you think. Is there an amateur version of an antigen presenting cell. And yeah, they're kinda is every nucleated cell in your body which means all of your cells except for red blood cells have one kind of MHC proteins on their surface called class 1 MHC, mhc1 proteins, present short, chains of amino acids that are based on endogenous proteins that is proteins synthesized inside that cell. So if a particular cell is healthy, the antigens on its MHC.  E1, tell roving immune cells that everything is. Okay, inside nothing to see here. But if the cell is say cancerous and it's making abnormal proteins, then it'll fix bits of those proteins to its image, see which alerts immune cells that there's a problem inside. And basically asks to be killed now, you're immune related cells, like macrophages, dendritic cells and B cells where Class 2 MHC proteins on their outside. So these are the professionals Class 2 MHC proteins, bind to fragments of exogenous. Antigens like a virus. That's been engulfed. Broken up and displayed to  Attention of other cells. And this is how mhcs are totally essential to the cellular immune response because the heroes of your cellular defenses, the T-cells can't actually detect whole antigens. They can only recognize them when they're all diced up and decorating an antigen-presenting cell T cells are made in the bone marrow, but they mature in the thymus the lymphoid gland that sits on top of your heart and which is actually what the T, and T Cell stands for, and you have several different kinds of T cells, but the to you really have to know about our helper T's and cytotoxic cells helper T's  as can't kill, but they can activate cells that do and they help call the shots for the whole adaptive. Immune response. Meanwhile, cytotoxic cells are the ones that actually do. The killing of the cells gone bad now much like, how a naive B cell carries antibodies, for one specific antigen, a naive helper, T cell has receptors that will only bind to one specific combination of a Class 2 MHC. And a particular antigen, if that matches, right? The helper T bonds to the MHC antigen bit and it gets activated, then just like with the B cells, we talked about last time, the helper T starts.  Copying itself like crazy making a few memory T cells as well, which remember that particular antigen should it meet one again in the future? And it also produces a whole mess of effector T cells. Mostly more helper T's but also some regulatory T cells that I will get to in a minute, but the main thing the helper T cells do is raise the alarm that tells other immune cells that there is a problem and they do this by releasing a cocktail of chemical Messengers called cytokines. When a cytokine enters another helper, T that cell usually starts dividing, making more memory, T cells and  More helper T's, which release more cytokines that keep boosting the signal. And some of those cytokines also go on to help activate. The cytotoxic T-cells know that, macrophages from the innate system, just sort of roll up and swallow, pathogens whole, but cytotoxic T cells. Do their killing a little differently. They roam the blood and lymph looking for hijacked, a mature body cells that are asking to be killed. Basically, these infected cells are already dying. So they've digested some of their Invaders proteins and stuck them on some of their class. One. MHC is effectively waving a surrender flag made.  Fragments of the very virus or cancer. That is destroying them with the cytotoxic T cell. With the right receptor floats by it binds to the antigen MHC combination and moves in for a mercy killing. It. Does this by releasing special enzymes, that punch holes in the cell's membrane or otherwise trigger apoptosis killing both the cell and whatever is inside of it, then the cytotoxic cell just detaches and continues to run down other prey. So by now, it should be pretty obvious that without T cells. They're basically is no adaptive immune response and it really all comes back to the helper.  Teas, which is why immunodeficiencies can be so deadly. AIDS for example, is caused by the human, immunodeficiency virus that specifically attacks helper, T cells and without the helper T's there wouldn't be much of a humoral response either because the cytokines that comes screaming out of the helpers not only activate other T cells, but they also finished the training of the B cells. The fact is most of your so-called naive B cells. Don't get fully activated and become memory or effector cells when they first bind to an antigen and there's a good reason for that since antibody receptors are generated randomly.  You might wind up with B cells that could bind to your own healthy proteins, like say your growth hormone. So once the B cell interacts with a substance, whether its growth hormone or some dangerous bacterium, it still needs to bind to it, engulf it and present some fragments of it, on its surface, but then it'll stop to await inspection. It pauses until the right helper T, cell comes by to check out its presentation. If the T Cell binds to the presented fragment, then it releases cytokines, which fully activate the B cell and suddenly you got antibodies going everywhere.  If it doesn't then the b-cell just goes about its business and doesn't trigger an immune response. This check and balance between bees and teas. Is an important Safeguard against your immune system becoming too good at its job, which is a very real risk hyperactive. Immune system can cause Mayhem by losing its ability to distinguish enemy from self as it turns on your own body, your regulatory T cells. Another type of effector, help prevent this by releasing inhibiting. Cytokines that tell other immune cells to stand down. Once the initial threat has been handled without that.  In the body might start cranking out too many antibodies and cytotoxic cells that could damage or destroy its own tissues. This dangerous confusion is what causes, many autoimmune diseases, like multiple sclerosis, which eats away at the myelin sheaths around neurons or type 1 diabetes, which tears up the pancreatic cells that make insulin. So the takeaway here is that your immune system is usually really good at its job, which is to kill stuff in the name of keeping you alive. And you really don't want it to go Rogue on you. Because if there's one thing you should have learned in the past year with us. It's that your body is both.  And fragile and it survives only when the sum of its many complicated Parts stays balanced and works together. And that is the Glorious Wonder view as we wrapped up our tour of the immune system today. You learned how the cellular immune response uses Helper cytotoxic and Regulatory T cells to attack body cells, compromised by pathogens. We looked at how cytokines activate B and T cells and what happens if your immune system goes Rogue and starts causing autoimmune trouble. Thank you to our Headmaster of learning Linnea boyev.

       " 'fepM3L7Pqc': \"In this video, we're going to talk about astrocytes astrocytes and their name comes from the Greek words for Star cell.  Astrocytes are glial cells of the central nervous system, which are derived from neural stem cells. Astrocytes have a Soma  A variable number and branches of processes, but they often have a lot. They often have quite a few processes that are highly branched which is how they got their name of star cells because some people thought they look like stars when they looked at them under the microscope and at the end of their processes, they have special structures called end-feet me just draw in a few of these and feet that are the at the Terminus of the astrocyte processes.  So that's end.  Feet.  That's all of these structures. At the end of astrocyte processes and astrocytes are work horses. They have arguably more functions than any other cell type of the nervous system. So first, we can talk about how the astrocytes really form, the scaffold for the entire central nervous system. These cells really occupy a huge amount of the space of the central nervous system and form, the majority of the structure that actually makes up the brain and the spinal cord. So,  Provide the structural support in the place for all the other cells to be like the neurons and all the other glia. The second function we can talk about is called the glial scar glial scar and that refers to what astrocytes do if there's injuries somewhere in the central nervous system. So if there is some type of injury somewhere in the brain or the spinal cord,  What we see is that astrocytes proliferate they divide and form more astrocytes and they migrated over to the area of injury. They then surround that area of injury and their processes hypertrophy. They grow these much larger thicker longer processes that actually serve to wall off that area of injury. And between all the processes they form a thick tissue.  Kind of like scar tissue that we see elsewhere in the body, but that scar tissue elsewhere in the body, is formed by different cell types because they astrocytes are only present in the central nervous system. So this whole process of astrocytes reacting to injury has multiple names. It's called gliosis or it's called Astro gliosis or it's called astrocytomas Isis or it's called reactive Astro cytosis and the actual Scar Tissue that's produced is called the glial scar. And the glial scar probably perform.  It's kind of a similar structural role to astrocytes role as the general scaffolding for the central nervous system because probably what they're trying to do is wolof in injured area and particularly, if there's a cavity of a whole has formed and they're trying to Shore that area up with structural support. From this wall. Another function of astrocytes is homeostasis and homeostasis. Just means trying to keep everything in optimal conditions and homeostasis of the  First ischl fluid, that is the fluid between all the cells of the central nervous system. And this is very important because the neurons require a very fine-tuned a very even Keel environment for them to function properly. And if certain things like the concentrations of certain ions and particularly potassium ions, if those concentrations are abnormal, the neurons can't function properly. So, one thing the astrocytes do is that they're constantly monitoring the  Digital fluid, and they're either taking in ions or they're releasing ions to try to keep those ion concentrations. Exactly the same. All the time in homeostasis. Another thing they do for neurons. Sometimes is they release lactate into the interstitial fluid. And the reason they do this is because neurons have very little internal energy stores in their cells. Neurons are completely dependent on a continuous supply of oxygen and glucose to have all the adenosine triphosphate.  Need to perform their functions. Now astrocytes do have some internal energy stores in the form of glycogen and they can convert some of that to lactate in secrete that. So that the neurons can use lactate in a pinch. If they have lost access to continuous oxygen and glucose. Another function of astrocytes is contributing to something. We call the blood-brain barrier blood-brain barrier.  And this is a barrier that prevents large molecules in the bloodstream. So I'll just draw a little blood vessel passing through the central nervous system and this prevents large molecules from leaving the blood to enter the central nervous system. Unless the cells actually want that large molecule to enter components of the blood vessels themselves. Play a role in this blood-brain barrier, but astrocyte processes also play a role and in particular It's The End feet.  These end feet on the end of their processes, are plastered all over the blood vessels that are passing through the central nervous system. And they play a role in preventing certain large molecules from leaving the bloodstream and entering the brain. So, that between the astrocyte and feet and components of the blood vessels of the central nervous system. There's a quite effective barrier function between the blood and the central nervous system in this includes the spinal cord, but we traditionally call this the blood-brain barrier. And one more very important function that  Astrocytes perform is that they help to clear out synapses between neurons. And so synapses are the connections between neurons and their target cells. So if we drew an axon of one neuron coming down here and this will be the terminal of the axon and then this axon is forming a synapse with say the dendrite of another neuron here.  Just like the astrocytes are using there in feet to surround the blood vessels that pass through the central nervous system. The astrocytes are also extending their processes and placing their in feet all over synapses. So that the end feet are plastered all over these synapses. And they're actually helping to clear out those synapses.  And we'll cover this more when we cover synapses. But basically they're clearing out the molecules that communicate between neurons and their target cell called neurotransmitters. And this is very important to reset the synapse so that it can be used again for communication between the neuron and its Target cell. Because if neurotransmitters just lingered in the synapse, then that synapse wouldn't be functional anymore. It would just constantly be turned on when instead the neurons need to be able to rapidly turn on and off the synapses to be able to communicate information.  Nation effectively, in addition to these functions astrocytes appear to influence neurons and other glia and vice versa through exchange of a variety of other substances. So as you can see, astrocytes are very hardworking cells in the central nervous system. No. Other cells of the nervous system appears to do such a huge variety of functions, like the astrocytes do.\",\n",
       " 'Rg-ao84fnrw': \"FDA and CDC are alerting Healthcare professionals about the risks of transmitting Hepatitis, B virus and other infectious diseases. When monitoring blood glucose in recent years, the FDA and CDC have seen an increase in reported hbv outbreaks associated with monitoring blood glucose. That's especially the case in long-term care settings, such.  As nursing homes and assisted living facilities, where residents often need someone to help monitor their blood glucose levels, but this risk exists in any setting where blood glucose monitoring equipment is shared or where those performing the monitoring. Don't follow basic infection control practices. This includes acute care facilities, as well as clinics health, fair's, shelters detention facilities, senior centers, schools and camps in a previous program.  Reminded practitioners that reusable finger, stick Lansing devices, should never be used for more than one person to avoid the risk of transmitting blood-borne pathogens, but the glucose meters themselves can also pose an infection risk because it's hard to ensure that blood has been completely removed from these devices. For example, a multicenter survey published in 2005 showed that 30 percent of blood glucose meters used routinely in the surveyed.  Vittles had detectable blood on their surfaces. So FDA and CDC recommended whenever possible blood. Glucose meters. Should be used for only one patient. That's not possible, clean and disinfect The Meters. After every use according to the meters labeling, to prevent carryover of blood and infectious agents, even when you're following these precautions.

       " 'hmAyFY6dhU': \"In screwed news last night. We told you about the potentially disturbing connection between Johnson and Johnson's branded baby powder in ovarian cancer. Well, it turns out that baby powder isn't the only Johnson & Johnson product Under Fire for dangerous side effects, Invokana a blood sugar drug made by Johnson & Johnson's subdivision, Janssen Pharmaceuticals. It's been connected to cardiovascular problems and kidney failure and now a recent court case in, Minnesota. Threatening to blow the whole thing wide open. I hope with me now for more on this is Consumer Attorney Travis lepas here a Travis welcome. I know you've been at this case now for a couple of years tell us what exactly Invokana is and what's it used to treat and what are the problems that we're finding with this drug? Sure pop. Well Invokana is a medication that's in a new class of diabetes treatments called sgml.  BLT to Inhibitors and the drugs are prescribed through type 2 diabetes patients with the intent of lowering their blood sugar and the drugs do that by preventing the patient from metabolizing the sugar that they consume and instead the person will excrete the the unmetabolized sugar through their urine and it just it passes through their system without ever being used as energy, you know, as you said Johnson & Johnson and Janssen are the the manufacturer in the cellar.  This drug in here in the US. The drug has been absolutely a huge Boom for for these companies to the tune of a billion dollars in annual sales and 2015. Okay, as you started looking at this case, first of all, the things that you found was was a cardiac arrest heart failure kidney failure ketoacidosis, which also can be fatal but it Travis isn't this another situation where  the FDA simply takes whatever the industries that whatever the drug manufacturer says, they take their word for it people think the FDA does their individual studies that Nifty does no studies Xarelto. For example, I know you're you you're one of the lawyers involved with that on Xarelto now, we're finding that the Duke studies that the FDA used might have been completely way way out of kilter. It might have been on purpose and so here this is another one that got bye.  It's a drug that nobody needs because there are plenty of drugs that do the same thing. How does this happen Time After Time Travis? Well, you know, I think it's even worse than just taking the company's word for it here, you know, especially with the cardiovascular issues. The FDA was aware that there was an increase or there's indications of increased risk of stroke and heart attack with Invokana yet. They still passed it through the advisory committee by 1/8 to  Even vote so it just got through by one vote and they were aware that the the cardiovascular events where a problem. So they told Jansen to go back and complete their trials and affect the fda's rubber-stamped using consumers as guinea pigs for Janssen while they complete their trial and determine whether or not heart attacks and strokes are a concern for Invokana and the initial trial numbers indicate that they are a problem Travis. Do you Fund in this practice that you do do you?  And that most people believe they honestly have a real belief that the FDA actually studies these drugs don't um, you know, that's you know, that's not accurate. I know that's not accurate but most people actually believe that the FDA has done studies on this themselves. Nothing is further from the truth. Is it? Yeah. Absolutely. I think you know the common person on the street expects the FDA to rigorously vet these drugs when they're coming up for approval and the reality is they don't do that at all.  It's much more of a rubber stamp and these drugs are put on the market and the American people are used as guinea pigs to determine whether or not they're actually safe and it all seems to flow from the top. For example, this committee that you talked about. The committee is political, isn't it? I mean this committee that reviews this is totally political there are plants that come directly from the pharmaceutical industry Sometimes they come directly from the company. Nobody asks questions about them being planted on this committee and it  It's just a matter of following the money, isn't it? Absolutely. All you have to do is look at Obama's recent nomination to had the FDA. You know that that person has been taking money from from Big Farmer for four years now and he's now being nominated to lead the FDA by the president of our country. So it's a pretty scary situation and Travis this Administration knows that I mean, it's very clear that you had Bernie Sanders out there on the stump saying that this guy is an Abomination and he is  Nevertheless Obama points him anyway because of the political impact that comes from the pharmaceutical industry so strong but with this Invokana product, this is a dangerous product the company the making it Jan Jansen is making it they call it their Cash Cow. It's making so much money. They call it their Cash Cow, people are being hospitalized. They're dying of heart attack. They're dying of kidney failure and the FDA sits there fat dumb and happy.  Did I get that right? Yeah, I think that that's absolutely right. And you know, I think it's really important that people understand one of the reasons this drug is so successful is because Janssen and Johnson and Johnson are out there grease in the doctors, right? So the doctors are the ones prescribing these drugs to the patients and we know that they have spent almost 30 million dollars since the drug has been on the market, you know paying doctors in various forms to be selling explain the  People can't even fathom that a doctor is being paid to prescribe medicine prescribed medicine explain how that works. Sure. It will it comes in many forms. There is often compensation for menial tasks and you know in the form of just a check to the doctor for performing a speech somewhere at a seminar there's often prestigious, you know seminar or speaking spots that they are offered there's vacations there's fancy dinners, there's all kinds of perks and benefits as well.  Laz just cash that these doctors are given in an effort to get them to prescribe the drug that the manufacturers want them to prescribe. So basically it's pay-to-play doctors know they have their hand out give me money and I will prescribe your new Cash Cow now the doctor at the same time and tell me if I'm wrong the doctor at the same time has many other Alternatives that have been on the market for a long time. They don't have to take chances. They don't there's  They have to do to take a chance here, but they take the chance anyway to make money. It's the old greed thing at work. We never believed that our doctor would do that but they're doing it everyday aren't they? Yeah, it appears. So, you know here it seems like greed is trumping safety. That's a really sad State of Affairs. But you know when it comes to Invokana and many prescription drugs that you see that caused the injuries that typically what you're seeing.  Approximately how many cases have been filed in less than a minute talk about is about how many cases have been filed in this case Travis? There's a there's a couple handful of cases that have been filed around the country. There's both state court and federal court litigation that's going on and you know, we're really getting ramped up for Discovery against these defendants. These are corporate Behemoth and it's going to take a lot to take them down on this drug, but we feel confident that at the end of the day this drug is causing.  These injuries ketoacidosis kidney failure and the heart attack and stroke as well. So we think that the litigation will go. Well it's very early on in the process but it will go up Travis. Thank you for joining us. Keep up the work on this case. If you don't do it, obviously nobody else is going to take care of this problem.\",\n",
       " 'LjSY00JlE': \"Every cell in the human body needs energy to survive and do it's different functions. If we're talking about a brain cell. It needs energy to keep stimulating other brain cells and sending on signals and messages. If it's a muscle cell. It needs energy to contract. They need energy just to do the basic functions of a cell. And the place that they get that energy from where the primary source of that energy is from glucose glucose, and glucose is a simple sugar. If you were to actually, Glucose. It would taste sweet, and glucose gets delivered to cells through the bloodstream. So this right here. I'm drawing some blood that's passing by a cell. Maybe the blood is going in that direction over there and inside the blood. Let me draw some small, some small glucose molecules passing by. And so in an ideal situation, when the cell needs energy glucose will enter the cell. So glucose will enter the cell.  Fortunately, it's not that simple for the great majority of cells in the human body. The glucose won't enter by itself. It needs the assistance of a hormone or molecule called insulins. Let me label all of these. This right here is glucose and it needs insulin. So let me draw insulin as these magenta molecules. Right over here, that over there. That is insulin.  In Zulan and the surface of the cells, they have insulin receptors on them and I'm just drawing very simplified versions of them, kind of a place where these magenta circles can can attach can bind. And what happens is in order for the glucose to be taken up by the cell, insulin has to kind of attached to these receptors, which unlocks the channels for glucose. In order for the glucose to go in insulin has to bind  To the insulin receptors. And then, once that happens, then the glucose can be taken up can be taken up by the cell. Now. Unfortunately, things don't always work as planned. So let me draw a couple of scenarios here. So once again, let me draw my very simple version of a cell and let me draw the blood stream going by.  Right over here. And then let me draw the glucose in the bloodstream. So I have my glucose floating by and then I have my insulin receptors, my insulin receptors on the surface of a cell. Now. The first thing that could go wrong here is what if the body does not produce insulin, insulin is produced in the pancreas. What happens if the pancreas is not producing insulin properly. So no,  No insulin. Well in this situation since there's nothing to bind to these receptors, the glucose channels won't be opened up, and the glucose will not be able to enter into the cell and this situation is type 1, diabetes type.  Type 1 diabetes, where you've got glucose. So in theory, you have energy and you have properly functioning insulin receptors, but you just don't have insulin to kind of unlock the gates for the glucose for the glucose to actually go into the cell, the other scenario that you could imagine happening. Let me draw the cell again, so there's my cell. And let me draw the blood flowing past the cell.  And once again, obviously this is just one of trillions of cells in the human body. We have an estimated 10 to 100 trillion cells. So this is a very simple diagram that hopefully gets the point across. So once again, let me draw some glucose floating by. Let me draw some insulin receptors on the cell. So insulin receptor, there may be insulin receptor right over there and let's say we even have some insulin so we are  Pancreas is producing insulin and putting it into our bloodstream. So it's there to be used but a situation can arise where the receptors are not working properly or we've become insensitive or, or desensitized to insulin. So, D, desensitized desensitized receptors. So, in this situation you have, maybe sometimes, maybe it might be the influence.  Hard to bind or even if it does bind, it's not working function properly. So the glucose will not enter the cell. And so neither one of the let me, well, I already wrote desensitized. So, in either one of these scenarios, let's just think in a very broad level. I'm not going to go into the details of the actual power P for these for these diseases of how it can be cured. Oh and I didn't even name the second one. The second one right here as you can imagine if this up here is type 1 diabetes, this down here is type 2 diabetes.  Type type 2 type 2 diabetes. Now, the way the simple way that or I don't want to say, it's definitely simple but the way that you can manage type 1, diabetes is you can inject insulin. The only problem here, is that the big one though is that there's no insulin in the blood stream. Everything else is working properly. So, over here, we can inject insulin, we can inject it, and then you'll have insulin to attach to the receptors.  And then the glucose can be processed properly type 2 diabetes. There's kind of multiple lines of attack. One thing that you can do there actually drugs that attempt to kind of re sensitize your insulin receptors. You can also do that with a combination of lifestyle changes that makes the makes your body. I guess more sensitized to do sugar or you can even and if things get severe enough you can  Add insulin. Just like you would do in type 1 diabetes and you can say, wait. I already have insulin here. Why would I add more insulin? Or remember? We're not kind of the cells can process in some but they're desensitized it would need more insulin in order to kind of up. Take the same amount of glucose. So if you add insulin, you could possibly have enough enough of a trigger that the glucose can actually be taken up, but there's multiple lines of attack here and usually, the first one are giving drugs that help. Hopefully make re sensitize, you, or make you less?  Desensitized to the actual insulin. So the last thing I just want to think about a little bit, is well, what happens if you didn't do this? Well, there's two major problems here. Obviously, your cells can't function if it's not taking up glucose. So your cells will have no energy. And another problem. If you, if you weren't to manage either one of these types of diabetes is that Sugar. Once it gets to enough, if it gets too high enough concentrations in the blood, it can actually cause a lot of damage, so sugar,  Sugar can cause damage damage to the body. So you don't want either of these things happening. You want yourself to have energy and you don't want to have too much sugar flowing in your blood and causing damage to your body.\",\n",
       " 'JFFzJ5g': \"Good afternoon. I would like to talk to you for a few minutes about my research in the area of type 2 diabetes self-management. I'll start out with just a few statistics related to diabetes in the United States. There are approximately 29 million people currently living with diabetes and about 95 percent of those cases have type 2 diabetes. About 86 million people also live with pre-diabetes and some of those don't realize that they even have pre-diabetes without significant lifestyle modifications about fifteen to thirty percent of those people will develop diabetes within the next five years. This is a slide from the CDC that shows the prevalence of diabetes in the United States and the increase And the numbers of people who have both obesity and diabetes that have occurred across a 20 year time period we're keenly aware and the South and particularly in Alabama of the incidence of diabetes and obesity and and how much it has increased in our area. So what's caused this increase? Well, primarily the lifestyle habits that we choose in the United States.  Our diets are not very healthy people in the United States many people tend to consume two large portion sizes. And then physical activity is not meeting their requirements for maintaining a healthy weight.  When used to think of type 2 diabetes as more of an adult disorder happened only to adult patients, but that has also changed over the years. There are now about 5,000 children diagnosed with type 2 diabetes each year. And you know why their parents are consuming these unhealthy Foods, they're feeding them to their children. They see their parents. He pain large portion sizes. They do the same thing. And then if they the parents are not being physically  Active then the kids are also less likely to be physically active.  So my interest for caring for patients with type 2 diabetes came and my nursing practice of taking care of many many patients with diabetes through the years and just always enjoyed working with this patient population who has a variety of educational needs.  The American Diabetes Association and the American Association of diabetes Educators recommends that patients receive self-management education and support initially at diagnosis and then ongoing as needed to help them manage their diabetes and make all these data they decisions that they're faced with and caring for their condition.  the aade specifically has seven self-care behaviors that they recommend patients with diabetes participate in and these include the ones you see on the screen healthy eating being Physically Active taking medications as they've been prescribed monitoring their blood glucose values problem solving for those day-to-day issues, you know, you wake up with a stomach virus you take your insulin that day  risk reduction behaviors going for annual eye exams annual foot exams to try to prevent some of the complications that occur with diabetes and then also healthy coping to deal with all the psychosocial issues that develop and people who live with chronic illnesses.  So my initial study was looking at relationships among these variables and found that self-efficacy was strongly associated with diabetes self-management behaviors. So I wanted to try and Implement something that would increase patients self-efficacy or their confidence to care for their diabetes. So we did a study at the diabetes and Nutrition Center that's affiliated with East, Alabama Medical  And we use an iPad application to track self-management Behavior. So participants log their self management behaviors each day and the study results found that their self management behaviors significantly increased in the second group of participants who use the iPads to track their behaviors have a couple of screenshots just so you can see  What the app looked like there are a kazillion apps out there now for diabetes self-management. So this is just one and these are some of the areas where they can enter their data. This is a screenshot of the glucose tab where they can enter their blood glucose each time. They assess bat at home.  A significant takeaway from this study some of the qualitative information that I got over and over again people said to me. Well, I really like this, you know, and they said things like it really helped me keep track of it. I found out that I wasn't doing as much as I thought I was doing for my diabetes, but lots of questions about diet that is an area that people living with diabetes need continual support and education for  Oh, I'm currently involved in a study where we've developed diabetes education modules and those have been placed on iPads and we're going out into the community and presenting that education to people in the community. So the educational modules were developed in conjunction with one of our graduate students in the School of Nursing and then we collaborated with dr. Richard Chapman and four of his  Your Design students and the computer science and software engineering so we developed all the educational content and they did something with the computer and put it on iPads for us so that it works  The name of the app is diabetes and you the School of Nursing conducts community health clinics or health promotion in clinics all across Lee County and surrounding counties these health promotion clinics are staffed by our faculty nurse practitioner who's sitting in front of me here and we take our undergraduate students as well as a nurse practitioner students to these clinics provide health screening.  Blood pressure screenings cholesterol glucose screenings. So in these clinics when patients are identified as having diabetes, then that gives me the opportunity to talk to them about their diabetes using this app.  These are the areas that are included in the app and you'll see that some of them are the same as the AED a de7 recommended behaviors.  As we go through some initial questions areas are identified with patients where they need additional education. So we may not cover all of these if they're totally comfortable checking their blood glucose and we may not cover that one. If they're not on insulin that we don't cover that one. The one that we always cover because they want to cover that one is the healthy eating section.  I have several screenshots so you can see some of the content that's within the app and we go through the content together and allowing the patient to ask questions.  Also has some activities built into the app. This is one of the questions that's in the app after we've covered some of the content. Then there are different activities that they can can do within the app. There's also a video which I do not have time to show you but there are videos like how to draw up your insulin how to monitor your blood glucose and this is another activity. So on all of the colored areas they can touch and  It's an appropriate area for insulin. It will tell you it's it is and if it's not it will tell you that that's not a place for injecting insulin. So you'll notice from this picture not all of our images show people of ideal body weight. Well many of our patients in these clinics are also not ideal body weight and because we want it to be able to relate to them we included diverse images to try.  I to reach out to two people who are also diverse and just a couple of more.  One on checking your blood glucose. And then this is another activity where after we've covered the content on complications. They can tap on any of those question marks and it will either asking a question that they need to answer or it will just provide a little blurb of content. So as our health promotion clinics continue to grow we hope to continue to involve an educational component for diabetes. I'll be finishing up the study.  At the end of this fall, but certainly hope to continue to include that education in our clinics.  Thank you.\",\n",

       " 'bIazck7rk': \"With peripheral vascular disease. Vascular refers to the blood vessels in peripheral means the outer limits or edge of something which are this case refers to essentially any vessels that aren't supplying the harder. The brain, like the legs arms or other organs peripheral vascular disease is when one of these arteries becomes narrowed, which reduces blood flow. And this often affects the limbs.  Peripheral vascular disease or PVD usually involves the arteries. And so sometimes it's also referred to as peripheral artery disease or PAAD.  DVD is most often caused by a blockage called organic PVD. Most commonly caused by atherosclerosis, which is a build up of lipids and fibrous material, just under the inner lining of the blood vessel called the Tunica intima when plaque builds up, it Narrows the artery which reduces perfusion to whatever tissue attends to supply, this buildup. Usually happens over the course of years. Also, though. The vessel could be blocked by an embolus which can happen suddenly. If a blood clot from some Upstream.  Lodges in a peripheral artery which obviously stops blood flow from getting to the tissue The Vessel supplies.  Besides organic pvd's though. There are also functional pvd's where blood vessels stop blood flow by changing diameter. Like with vasospasms with a vessel constricts in blood flow is reduced. This type is usually short term and can come and go.  Right. So the most commonly affected vessels in peripheral. Vascular disease are the arteries supplying the legs. So, when less blood gets to the muscle tissue in the legs that tissue sees less oxygen and becomes ischemic ischemic cells release adenosine, a type of signaling molecule, which is thought to affect nerves in these areas, which is felt as pain. This pain in the legs is often referred to as claudication.  Sometimes even though it's narrowed at rest. There's enough blood to meet the tissues demands, and many people are usually asymptomatic. But if that person is walking or exercising, then the leg muscles start to work harder, and demand more oxygen. So demand becomes greater than what's being supplied, which causes the claudication or pain.  The location of the pain is a clue on which arteries involved if it's the hips and the buttocks, think lower aorta or iliac. If it's the thigh then think iliac or common femoral artery for the upper two-thirds of the calf, The Superficial femoral artery, the lower one-third, that popliteal artery. And finally, for the foot, think tibial or peroneal artery.  Other symptoms include leg or foot wounds or ulcers that don't heal up normally as well as color changes of focal areas of the skin. So, for example, if the legs been affected the foot might turn pale white, when it's raised called elevation puller since gravity sort of working against blood flow, to the lower extremities, which already has a hard time getting through that narrowed artery.  Likewise the foot might turn red when it's lowered called dependent ruber. Since gravity is now working with the blood flow. We can see that gravity seriously starts to affect blood flow in the affected arteries.  As that arterial blockage gets bigger, less and less. Blood gets the tissues which can lead to more serious complications. First rest pain describes a continuous burning or pain in the four foot and toes when the legs are elevated and then the pain is relieved when they're lowered, like hanging the feet over the bed or walking around the room, which allows more blood to get down to the foot.  If the blockage is severe enough, then the limb might be at risk of gangrene death of the tissue because without oxygen for long enough, the cells can actually die or nekros in which case the dead tissue would likely have to be removed. And in some cases, the limb would have to be amputated.  The major risk factors in causes of peripheral vascular disease are the same as those for atherosclerosis. The same process that if involved in the neck, arteries can cause a stroke. And if involved in the coronary arteries can cause a myocardial infarction or heart attack, smoking seems to be the biggest contributor to PVD but other diseases and conditions are also linked to higher risk of PVD like diabetes, dis lipedema, or an abnormal amount of lipids in the blood and hypertension.  Diagnosing PVD usually involves listening to the pulse in the iliac arteries of the legs with a stethoscope since that artery's been narrowed. It can make a whooshing sound called a brute. Another test that can be done is a Doppler ultrasound which is a non-invasive way of visualizing blood flow.  The most common test though to diagnose peripheral artery disease is the ankle brachial index or ABI, where blood pressure is taken in the ankle, and in the arm and then compared peripheral artery disease, is typically diagnosed with the systolic blood pressure in the ankle. /. The systolic blood pressure in the arm is less than Point 9.  In general claudication is often seen in people with an ABI between point for and .9. Rest pain is seen between point 2 and point for and tissue loss ulcers in gangrene between zero and point four.  Treating PVD often requires significant lifestyle changes. That address the underlying risk factors like quitting smoking for one as well as adopting healthy eating habits and exercising. Regularly alongside these though, sometimes people with PVD will also get certain medications that typically aim to reduce the likelihood of blood clotting and obstruction of the blood vessels surgical intervention, like angioplasty or bypass surgery is rarely needed.

       " 'RudR2_VVoaw': \"Alright, so when you drink alcohol, what happens? Well, okay, what happens to the alcohol? Well, that's mainly your livers job, right? Basically, once the alcohol gets your stomach, most of it sent to your liver for processing in very small amounts. Alcohol is more or less harmless, but in excess, it can lead to Serious liver complications and is the leading cause of liver disease in Western Nations. Once in the liver cells or hepatocytes, it can take one of three Pathways one of which involves an enzyme called alcohol, dehydrogenase or simply ADH. And this happens in the cytosol of the cell, another involves a catalase inside organelles called peroxisomes and a third involves being converted by the enzyme cytochrome p450 to E1. Sometimes, just shortened to cyp2e1.  All three of these Pathways lead to the conversion of alcohol to acetaldehyde. Once the ADH enzyme is used to convert the alcohol. It needs another compound called nad+, which is then converted into nadh as nadh levels, increase and nad+ levels. Decrease. This has two effects, higher nadh levels. Tell the cell to start producing more fatty acids and lower nad+ levels, result in less fatty acid oxidation.  Both of which lead to more fat production in the liver.  Now, excessive fat in the liver is also known as fatty change or fatty liver, where it gets large, heavy greasy and tender, but typically at this point patients don't have symptoms like fever or high levels of neutrophils in the blood. The liver also often takes on a more yellowish color, which is due to all these fat deposits and we can see that on histology. All these circles are deposits of fat that contribute to fatty liver disease and sometimes this buildup  Fat in the liver is referred to as steatosis.  Treating fatty liver disease usually involves simply stopping alcohol consumption.  Okay, so that's fatty liver. But that's not the only thing that excessive alcohol consumption can cause right.  Looking back at our Pathways when you make acetaldehyde from ethanol, you also start to generate these ominous sounding compounds called reactive oxygen species. You can probably guess that these guys are super reactive and contain oxygen. Some examples are like hydrogen peroxide the hydroxyl, radical or the superoxide anion.  These reactive oxygen species, react with different components of the hepatocyte, like, proteins, and even DNA. And this process can cause serious damage to the cells.  Besides producing reactive, oxygen, species. Now. We've also got acetaldehyde to worry about and this compound combined to macromolecules enzymes, the cell membrane and all sorts of other compounds inside the cell. When they bind to some of these, they effectively inhibit that molecule. And when that happens they form what are called acetaldehyde. Add ducts.  And when those are formed, your immune system recognizes these new compounds as foreign and start sending neutrophils to sort of clean up the damage. So not only do you get these a ducts binding to and potentially messing with the function of certain molecules in the cell. You also get destruction of the hepatocyte. It's by neutrophilic infiltration.  As the cells become inflamed in damaged patients have now developed alcoholic hepatitis, and we start to notice a change on histology and notice these bundles of proteins called Mallory bodies. Specifically, these are damaged intermediate filaments and are located in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. The mechanism that produces these bodies is still unclear, but they're most commonly seen in alcoholic hepatitis.  At this point, the patient might have hepatomegaly. That's probably become painful. Since the liver is seeing more and more immune cells. They also may have neutrophilic leukocytosis or an increased amount of neutrophils In The Blood. Also as cells become damaged and die off Scar Tissue starts to form around the central veins of the liver known as para venir fibrosis. The Damage Done to her podocytes also results in leakage of liver enzymes like  Alanine aminotransferase, or alt or aspartate, aminotransferase or AST? Both types of transaminase. Usually, even though both are elevated, ASU will be found to be greater than alt and alcoholic hepatitis.  In addition to these two serum alkaline phosphatase or Alp and Gamma gluten meal transferase, or ggt will also be elevated in some cases thrombocytopenia a deficiency of platelets in the blood as well as possible hypoglycemia, or low. Blood sugar can also be found in the blood of someone with alcoholic liver disease.  Treatment again, involves completely stopping alcohol consumption. And in some cases, corticosteroids can help suppress the immune system.  Finally if it's allowed to progress far enough, chronic alcohol induced liver damage may lead to cirrhosis and liver failure.\",\n",
       " 'K0EiV_31o': \"Just in case any of you did not know. I do. Caption all of my videos. All you have to do is press that caption button, which is just below, its the little CC box. They're all captioned. So if you need it, it's there. Well, hello everybody. And welcome back to my Channel or if your new. Hello, welcome to my channel. My name is Sophie. Gastroparesis is a let's be honest, and they're sadly isn't safe options when it comes.  To food, there are safer options, but these still come with consequences for me at least. Anyway, I recently saw a nutritionist or dietitian. Is that a difference between the two?  I don't know, but she actually made quite a lot of sense in what she said. Now, in my many years of gastroparesis. I have certainly been through my fair share of nutritionists, and they basically told me what foods to avoid. And that I can't eat anything besides water pretty much this lady. As you told me what I can eat to try and reduce symptoms. It's not a cure and it's still going to come with some consequences, but it tries to reduce the symptoms whilst giving  Your balanced diet, which is what I have really, really struggled with over the years. And whilst there are foods that do take longer to digest and therefore give more symptoms. It is all about having things in moderation. Another interesting thing that I learned from her was that different foods actually digest differently when eaten together then eaten alone.  Mind blown. Let me give you an example. Bananas. I do love me a good banana. However, bananas do have a lot of fiber in and whilst it is good for your body. Fiber is harder to break down, especially with gastro process. So when you eat them alone, they take longer to digest and therefore can give more pain, more nausea and even lead to constipation. However, if you add some almonds or almonds, almonds almonds into the mix,  The two combined digest completely differently and are then actually really good for you. Almonds can actually help aid digestion.  Bet you didn't know that one. A lot of nutritionists have told me to avoid fresh fruit, where possible, because of the sugar in them and they take longer to digest and terms or breaking down that sugar. And because of our stomach, they sit there for longer and they can rot and they can even lead to stomach infections. And trust me. I've been there. It ain't Pleasant it hurts and it stinks because it gives you really, really, really bad wind that it makes the people.  In the car, went to clear out because it smells so bad. Sorry, Mom and Dad. But if you add a hard-boiled egg with that fresh fruit, bam, different story altogether, something to do with the protein in the egg and the fruit. I'm not a scientist. I'm not a nutritionist. I don't know the in-depth reasoning for these things. And I know that when you look up online, what it does tell you certain things, some of the things on there will vary for  people with gastroparesis because of the rate of body digests that anyway, but it's definitely worth asking your nutritionist and obviously everybody is different. Every person reacts to things differently. I used to have safe options now, I don't maybe someone still does but even if it helps just a little bit, every little helps as the price. Yeah, that was sad and if you don't live in the UK, you probably have no idea what I'm talking about, but  Members are advised. That was it Salon. I don't really watch TV anymore. Now, there are still things that are better to avoid just because they don't digest very well. I was told to avoid peanuts still and rather stick to tree nuts like almonds, cashews, walnuts because they can actually help aid digestion and that's obviously a good thing because and that means less symptoms. We hope and things like fresh fruit or raw vegetables. Obviously, if you  Can blend it great. You've done a half the work for your stomach and then your stomach should have absolutely no, excuse. However, it still does what it wants anyway, but if you don't want to blend it all, you want it, cook it. It's going to digest quick. Now. The one thing that I have always been told by my mom by my doctor's, by my gastroparesis specialist by like, literally everyone is that you should have small, meals little, and often everyone is actually supposed to do this. You're supposed to have six smaller.  Rather than three larger meals, but I mean, ain't nobody got time for that. So everyone does it the wrong way basically. And there's two reasons for that particularly in. Goshen polluters. Why you should do this. The first one is if you give your stomach, a huge meal to try digest, it basically goes goes. Well, what do I do with food? Like I can't even speak because my body's just like what what big male know basically it just makes your stomach go into complete like oh my God.  How do i digest this all? And it just spasms. And the second reason for this is because, but eating little bits of food, regularly actually helps to speed up your metabolism because it encourages digestion, so little and often is the key for anyone in life, but particularly, if you have gastroparesis and that one you will see a difference because the more you eat, the more pain, you're going to be in or the more you gonna throw up or the more likely you are to do.  Yes, gastroparesis has a mind of its own and some days it will just do it even at the smell of food, but you can try and help encourage it and if you're encouraging your body, maybe over time. I'm hoping my body will be like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna do what that that's telling me to do and it might actually do the normal human thing. I can hope. For me personally. I don't have any gluten just because that when I do have gluten, I do get very bloated, which in turn causes more pain.  Pain, so, I do tend to stick to a gluten-free diet. I also don't have dairy very much like a bit of chocolate or bit of cheese is okay, but I wouldn't go and have a glass of milk or yogurt ice cream that kind of thing because it just makes me feel really sick and unwell, and that is because gluten and dairy are actually very hard for the stomach to digest in small amounts. Yes, for some people, I am gluten intolerant. So for me personally, I can tolerate like a little bit.  In the sauce or something, but give me a damage or pasta. Me and my body ain't going to be very happy. Basically. It was a fine red. Meats are harder to digest, and that is because they are fatty and they do just take longer for the body to digest. So I get more pain. So I tend to avoid it for the most part. I tend to stick to chicken, turkey. Tuna, salmon, they are all very good for your body. They are easy to digest and they have oils and  fats and proteins that your body needs, which is always very handy. Those for me are the easiest on my stomach most of the time sometimes. Well, occasionally whenever my body feels like being nice to me. So, that is all for this video. I hope you found it helpful. There is no cure for gastroparesis. There isn't any particular food. That's not going to cause some form of symptom, but it is just about controlling it in the best way that you can.  And trying to keep it under control. We all have bad days. We all have good days, everyone's different but this is what helps me personally. And so I thought I would share with you guys in case you're really struggling or you are new to gastroparesis. So if you did like this video or you found it helpful in any way at all, be sure to give it a big thumbs up so that I know and if you're not already, I would love for you to click that subscribe button so that we can learn more together, share experiences, really.

       " 'RV_lBWGgK1o': \"Hello, I'm Tom Mason of the diabetes, Council.com researcher writer and I have type 2 diabetes. Now. I want to emphasize that my perspective is coming from one with type 2 and not type 1 diabetes. Our channel is primarily targeted for those with type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes. Today. I want to talk about why it is important to know if a person has prediabetes.  After you watch the video today, I invite you to check out the description box for my new ebook. This is one of the most comprehensive diabetes meal planning books. You can find anywhere it contains, diabetes friendly meals and recipes recipes for different goals. Such as eight hundred, two 1800 calories per day meal plans, diabetes meal, planning tips and tricks. And there are also tons of diabetes friendly recipes for everyone.  Now, this is a great question and I have thought of several ways to approach it. But I've narrowed it down to two. I will first. Look at why it is important for you to know and then why it is important for others to know as well? First. Let's define what pre-diabetes is and is not diabetes is defined as having a fasting plasma blood, glucose level of 126 milligrams per deciliter or greater on two separate occasions.  Occasions if diabetes symptoms exist and you have a casual blood glucose taken, at any time that is equal to, or greater than 200 mg, and a second Test shows the same high blood glucose level. Then you have diabetes, in general, people who have a fasting plasma glucose in the 100 to 125. Rains are defined as having impaired fasting glucose. Now, if your  Doctor gives you an oral glucose tolerance test and at two hours, your blood glucose is 142. 199, you have impaired glucose tolerance. Now, either of these is a medical terminology for what your doctor is referring to. When he says you have pre-diabetes, now the foremost authority in my opinion on anything diabetes-related is the Joslin Diabetes Center and they offer this piece of advice.  Sure to ask your doctor, what your exact blood sugar test results are when he tells you that you have pre-diabetes. Some Physicians are not as familiar as they should be with the new National guidelines for diagnosing diabetes. They may be telling you, you have pre-diabetes when in fact you have actual diabetes. So to answer the question, the main reason, I think you need to know if you have prediabetes is so that you can take steps necessary.  Terry to hopefully keep it from becoming diabetes. This is the main reason why anyone should know if they have pre-diabetes, who is at a higher risk of having prediabetes. Well, according to the Joslin Diabetes, Center among those, who should be screened for pre diabetes, include overweight, adults, aged 45 and older. And those under age 45 who are overweight and who have one or more of the following risk factors, habitually physically, inactive have  And previously been identified as having impaired fasting, glucose or impaired glucose tolerance have a family, history of diabetes, are members of a certain ethnic group, Asian Americans, African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Native Americans have had gestational diabetes or have given birth to a child weighing more than nine pounds have had elevated blood pressure, have an HDL cholesterol level the good.  Cholesterol of 35 or lower and or triglyceride level of 250 or higher have had polycystic ovary syndrome and have a history of vascular disease. Now, if you fall Within These categories, you should be screened as soon as possible. Then you can get a plan together to prevent any further damage. I also think your family and friends should know that you have pre-diabetes. They can be a great source of support and comfort.  In this lifestyle change and it will take place one way or another. There will be a chain, but most of all, if you do find out you have pre-diabetes, there is good news. There are two key factors to anyone having diabetes. If you have the right diet and physical activity, you with pre-diabetes can prevent it from becoming diabetes and some of the ill effects that comes from the disease.

Well extremely high blood sugar levels can be dangerous and they can cause lasting Health complications. Remember if you ever have blood sugar readings that  In high for more than 24 hours without coming down and after an effort has been made to lower them. You need to call your health care provider immediately. That being said we've all had those days when we get a random high blood sugar reading and we're not sure what caused it or we forget to give insulin or we eat a delicious dessert without realizing how much sugar is actually in it. We've all been there for whatever reason those out of the ordinary high blood sugar readings happen and need to be  treated no need to rush to the doctor for every high blood sugar reading though. There are some simple steps. You can take to lower your blood sugar fast. The following can help most people bring down their blood sugar to an acceptable level. However, if you have any questions about how to bring down your blood glucose, it's important to talk to your healthcare provider. They know your situation much better than I do and can give you a plan of attack for high blood sugar, but for everyone else the first thing we need to  It was watch for signs of high blood sugar, you know, the feeling extreme thirst sluggishness nausea blurred vision a downright sick feeling and your family or friends may tell you that extreme irritability is a major sign. You need to check your blood sugar to see if it's high. Well the best thing to do is Catch it before it gets really high or it will be harder to bring down quickly causing havoc on your blood sugar readings for days. Now if you do not take insulin as part of your treatment plan.  And these tips will show you how to lower your blood sugar fast. If you take insulin, you will first want to give the appropriate amount of insulin to correct the blood sugar. However, insulin still take some time to take effect before Bringing Down the blood sugar. So these tips will help you feel a bit better in the meantime insulin is the medication that will bring down blood glucose the fastest someone who uses mealtime insulin can take correction doses to lower blood glucose. This requires a thorough understanding.  I think however of when to inject how often to give correction Doses and how much insulin to use you'll need to work with your doctor or diabetes instructor to learn how to do this. Well, that being said, I have three major tips that will help you lower your blood sugar fast. First of all hydrate, the more water you drink the better drink at least two glasses of water immediately one right after the other water will help flush out your system and stabilize the glucose in your  Your bloodstream according to David Spiro who's an RN and a contributor to WebMD quote for people with diabetes. The risk of dehydration is greater because higher than normal blood glucose depletes fluids to get rid of the glucose the kidneys will try to pass it out in the urine, but that takes water so the higher your blood glucose the more fluids you should drink which is why thirst is one of the main symptoms of diabetes. So number one hydrate number two.  Exercise exercise is a good way to get better blood sugar control and keep your blood sugar levels in a healthy range is part of your routine management, but exercise can also help lower blood sugar when it is excessively High by getting your heart pumping. It's your blood flowing what uses up the glucose in your bloodstream faster. It will also get your endorphins going which will help your body start to feel better soon. Try to keep your heart rate up for at least 10 to 15 minutes. Check your  blood sugar intermittently to prevent it from rebounding too low and your attempts to stabilize it if your blood sugar's have been so high that you have high ketones in your blood a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis that could happen. So you do not exercise because it could actually drive your blood sugar even higher. You also need to eat a protein snack protein acts as a blood sugar stabilizer and can slow the absorption rate of  Goes one of the symptoms of high blood sugar is increased hunger. So this can help satisfy that craving while helping lower the blood sugar at the same time now, don't grab a snack. That's a lot of sugar along with the protein. You just be defeating the purpose of it good sources of protein include a tablespoon of no sugar added peanut butter or an ounce of cheese. Just don't overdo it the most important thing you can do for your health and your diabetes is to pay close attention to how you feel whenever you feel like  Like something is out of whack. It probably is. So test your blood sugar and do something about it in the long run. It's easier to do your best to keep your blood sugar's tightly controlled and to live with the consequences of not doing so don't forget to get my new ebook and please subscribe to our channel for many more videos like this one in the future.

And I want to welcome to the show Fontaine. This is all the rage now, geds a lot of talk about changes coming up. But in the meantime, there are people who are just trying to get their geds the way they've been trying to get them for years and they're concerned. But this program actually addresses maybe those who are concerned about getting it done the old-fashioned.  Away, but also to help people get broadened their skills and other areas because it's very important in the workforce today to know how to do things like operate a computer and read a computer to develop their soft skills. Yeah, and to be overall, ready for the workplace right there. Stop skills. Can you explain what that is for people that being able to interview? Well, being able to know how to dress when they go into interviews and overall.  Preparing the foil packets pattern, the package, that's a professional package. That will allow them to impress that employer. When they walk through the door. I know that there are number of students that have gone through the doors and have done well, and those you remember, and those who do struggle, but it's still a very important that people are aware, that it's not easy to walk into the workplace now and just expect that it'll be plugged in will allow  Those students who earn their GED credential, the opportunity to move forward in a way where when they complete that plugged in program. They're actually they'll walk away with a three-fold certification. They'll have their GED credential they'll have their career, career resource certificate. They'll also have my, they'll be Microsoft ready. They will just overall be ready in the workplace. The plugged in is  Actually a career pathway program, that provides motivated and I stress motivated, adults, the opportunity to earn college credits as they're earning, their GED. And in Chesapeake. Well Region 20, as we're called now because Region 20 actually includes the City of Virginia Beach, Norfolk Chesapeake Portsmouth, Southampton County Isle of Wight County Franklin, and one more. And I'm drawing a blank.  With the one more. Let me check my notes to Dan because I don't want to leave anyone out. And when I'm checking my notes to because the leaves, I don't want to leave out that one person. Let's start over. Virginia Beach Norfolk Suffolk Portsmouth, alawite Franklin, Southampton County in Chesapeake. I was actually leaving us out. I believe what we do. I do that. Don't want to do that. Okay, great. Well, that's why that's a large area to cover.  Yes, it is, and plugged in is absolutely free to the student. We have partnered with Tidewater Community College as our post secondary, secondary resource and within the city of Chesapeake, our information technology department who will come together with us to develop an A+ networking program. That so that that individual who goes through the first cohort of,  Plugged in for Region 20, they will walk away with that GED credential, and the plugged in certification. Well, I'm sorry, 28 plus certification us occasion. So this is all about Partnerships and Technology as well as an education in general, and we're in the process of partnering with area Information, Technology, businesses, that will be willing to give that student that plugged in student the opportunity to come.  Interview and perhaps even obtained an internship. So that they are prepared for the workforce. That's terrific system. Practical experience. Yes. Well, which is really important. So people can take what they've learned and apply it. Yes. Yeah. Well what who would be you mentioned motivated people but is their age range or who would apply for this would be your ideal plugged in candidate is an individual that is at least 18 years old and as far  far as a maximum age, we don't have one. Okay, but we're looking for the individual that is at least 18 years old and basically ready to go out into the workforce. They'd have to be highly motivated. We were looking for the student that is at least functioning on a 10th grade level or above. And the reason for this is because it's such a rigorous.  Curriculum, you're earning college credit. You're working on your GED and you're also working on your information technology skills all at once. So it requires a student that's committed to study statistics, being a good student, that's committed to coming to class because this program within a week's time. The student is only actually in class for 15 hours per week. So it has to be a student.  It is willing to study outside of the classroom as well. I see. Well 15 hours a week. Still seems like a lot to someone who may not have been in school for a while. Yes. It does. I watch or the adjustment is great. But as you said being motivated is certainly part of that willingness to to Really apply oneself to getting it done. Is there a limit to the number of people you can bring into programmer, each cohort? And this is bit with this being the first cohort for Region 20. We have a maximum number of students.  Of 20, we're trying to develop a cohort that has at least a maximum of 20 students. But at least minimum is 12. So we don't, we don't want our numbers to fall below 12 within our first cohort. All right. Well, then that's, you know, and because this is available region why, you know, folks in Norfolk and might be watching this show, you know, think about it. And there's a number on the screen. You can call to find out more about this. Does this run for a particular length of time? This like each of, I don't know if you call him.  Yes, each cohort will run for approximately six months. Okay? And during that during that six-month period, each student will receive Counseling Services as well as their in-class instructional Services. Okay, so they get a lot of support along the way but that sport is there as long as they want to move forward. Yes. Yeah. So this just said through Chesapeake Public Schools is being implemented and then there are Partnerships and  the area that provide support and a way to really flush this whole thing out. Right? What else does a person need to know about what they need to do? What a person who desires to get involved with plugged in. The first thing that they would need to do? Would be to call the Chesapeake Public Schools, department of adult and continuing education for everyone who inquires about plugged in and  Will be mailed to them. The application process consists of, of course, filling out the plugged in application. Also completing a Workforce Development application, which is includes opportunity ink, I don't know if you're familiar with opportunity Inc. Which is our Workforce Development.  Office here in in our area in Region 20, so we'll include also completing financial aid, the federal, the federal financial aid application as well as their application for Tidewater Community College. Because it's important to keep in mind that the student will be duly enrolled in Tidewater Community College, as well as Chesapeake.  Schools adult and continuing education department of paperwork, but that is a lot of painting work, but it's good practice. All right. Well, it sounds like a terrific program and I hope that your response to it is as great and and that this in turn will be a success. Not only for the program but for the people that have gone through it, so I think it's, you know, it's a wonderful opportunity for people who may have been sitting on this time to go. But once you, once you commit like, when you were ready to work be committed, yes, yes.  Auntie, thanks so much. Thanks for sharing this program. We have a lot of things going on with GED.

       " 'S09YWIykt2Y': \"Hi, I'm Steve Hodges associate professor of Pediatric Urology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine. And I want to talk to you about urinary tract infections in children's primarily a little girls because that's who gets most of them many of you may not be familiar with the urinary tract blood goes to your kidneys. You have two of them which produce urine which flows down to tubes called the ureters and your bladder where you store the yearn and then evacuate it now when you need to every urinary tract infection little  girl happens when bacteria from the: comes out of the colon travels up into the urethra and bladder and sets up shop and that's what causes urinary tract infections. They can present with the varying symptoms typically urgency or having a pee very quickly dysuria or pain while urinating sometimes it can even progress to urinary frequency and sometimes fever chills nausea and vomiting. Those are not our actually kidney infections, which we won't talk about right now. We're focusing primarily on the bladder infections. I want to talk about somehow you're on track.  Infections happen and some of the myths about them. So we discuss that every infection happens when bacteria travel into the bladder from the: so, there's only three risk factors that girls can have that cause infections one in the primary one is constipation. If you don't let all the stool out over: you lead to infections second is vo Vitus or inflammation of the skin between the rectum and the urethra that allows bacteria that cause infections to live on the skin more easily and make their way into the bladder and the third is incomplete or irregular empty-handed.  Bladder kids hold their urine too long and that is a definite way to lead to infections a good reminder about that is that I very rarely see urinary tract infections in children prior to toilet training that's because they have a less incidence of constipation their moms, you take really good care of the bottoms and they never hold their urine because I don't have a reason to some common myths for infection include the way you wipe. In fact, it's never been proven that wiping front to back or back to front as any effect on the incidence of infections. Also a lot of Physicians will tell kids  not take baths and to take showers instead and that's really has a no bearing on infections depending on the kind of bath you take if you are in a irritating soaps or bubble bath, sometimes it can cause inflammation which is we mentioned vo vytas can as a respect for infections but sitting in tub is actually can be beneficial sometimes especially if you use non-irritating soaps and sometimes if you have irritation on your bottom just using baking soda or oatmeal or a cup of apple cider vinegar can actually Su the irrigation like people often use  Cranberry juice to help treat infections cranberry juice. There's rare data that may help prevent infections, but it's not very strong. It definitely cannot treat infections. So the main thing for little girls to do to help prevent infections is number one treat constipation. Number two, make sure the bottom is clean and dry number three is urinate on time. If you do those three things, it's impossible to get an infection if you think your daughter has an infection because she's peeing frequently being very urgently or having new set on Seven Continents or pain with urinating then you should take her to a physician and whether we'll check your urine.  it's called a urinalysis child voice into a cup and they look at it under a microscope and there's certain findings on that analysis that will tell them there's an infection if the infection has no fever just as bladder seems if we discussed it's very simple to treat you just take some antibiotics and it gets better if the child has fever nausea vomiting and flank pain, then that can be a kidney infection which is much more severe and you may need some Imaging studies such as a renal ultrasound or avoiding sister urethra Graham to evaluate the child's Anatomy to see why they are at risk for these  horse infections. It's important though. If you have these new bladder symptoms to see your pediatrician to get this evaluated quickly.\",\n",
       " '3wUYhJmdbA': \"Hey, I'm dr. Josh Axe, and welcome to transformation TV. This week. I'm going to be talking about artificial sweeteners, which are some of the most deadly compounds on the planet and you and your family want to stay completely away from artificial sweeteners. Now, artificial sweeteners came about most of the time they came about accidentally not even on purpose, but people found they had a sweet sweet texture and taste to them and the most actually the number one used artificial. Sweetener of the past two decades has been artificially Known as aspartame and aspartame was first started being used in Diet Coke. And actually, they saw in 1981 with Diet Coke was introduced on the market. Brain tumors increased with it exponentially. And so they Rosen King in correlation with it. And that was just one big side effect. Now, another study done at the University of Texas found that are aspartame caused kidney damage and weight gain. And so a lot of times you think well, I'm drinking a diet coke or a die.  Diet, you know, diet soda, shouldn't that cause my weight to decrease actually at the University of Texas. They found for every diet soda, you drink your chance of weight gain goes up by 41 percent. And so in the reason is is these are toxic chemicals toxins. Get stored in your fat cells. If you're drinking lots of diet soda there, it's going to be stored in your cells in your body. Cannot burn fat and lose weight. So if you're trying to lose weight, kick the diet soda immediately and  One of the most dangerous things. In fact to know about Aspartame, is what it breaks down into, actually aspartame breaks down in your body into what alcohol formaldehyde and ethanol which are toxic chemicals. And they're known to be carcinogenic. They actually cause cancer and that's why you want to stay away from these. There's a great documentary out there called Sweet Misery. If you want to get a whole DVD series on this again, you're going to want to read up on again. Go watch the DVD. Sweet Misery. Another  Artificial sweetener, that is shockingly. Dangerous is sucralose, and it's found in a product called Splenda. Now, a lot of people think well, Splendid, I thought that was a health food or I thought it came from sugar, Splenda started out off, coming from sugar, but they add a chlorine, ion, a chlorine molecule onto the sugar. And so, basically what happens if you're drinking Splenda or sucralose, it's breaking down into your body as chlorine. I actually recently had a patient come into my clinic.  And they told me about a friend of theirs who had just been hospitalized for three days for chlorine poisoning. And the doctors told him, it was from her using too much Splenda. She was actually using cups of Splenda and her baking and sweetening and actually found that again, it caused chlorine poisoning in her body. So if you are doing Splenda again, plan on, or just know that it's chlorine, you're dumping, it's like drinking, chlorinated water. It causes cancer. You want to stay completely away from these.  No, sweeteners now, places, you're going to want to look for these artificial sweeteners. And the names are going to be looking for top 2 names. You'll look for our sucralose and aspartame. Now, if you ever use protein powders, you've got to look in your protein powders for these. Number one. If you're drinking a diet soda, 99% of the time, it's going to have sucralose or splenda in it and even things like Crystal Light and a lot of the different sweeteners out there, you're going to find again. They have these artificial sweeteners in them. You got to  Your labels. You do not want to bring this stuff in. I'd rather someone honestly, I'd rather someone drink regular sugar. Then do artificial sweeteners because there are neurotoxins their talk to toxic chemicals. Now, here's what you want to do. Instead. You want to switch over to an all-natural sweetener, something like Stevia. Now, this is personally, what I use but Stevia is a all-natural sweetener that comes from the herb of a flower and it's no calories. And so it's not going to cause the added weight gain and so I'll add a little bit of stevia and  Two things like berry smoothies that I do. If I want to sweeten something up a little bit, again. Stevia is a great option, all-natural, some other things you can do, you got to be careful the sugar content, but raw, honey, Grade B, maple syrup and things like coconut nectar, other good options and fruit, but that's what I'd go ahead and stick with when you're doing the when you're trying to sweeten things up. Again, if you want to do no sugar though. Stevia is the way to go. And there's a lot of all natural products coming out that you're going to find it. Natural health food store.  That actually contain Stevia. This is the way you want to go. So, remember action steps for the week. Get rid of all the artificial sweeteners. Get rid of the aspartame, get rid of the sucralose switch over the Stephen, the all natural sweeteners and may just save your life in a friend. And if you like this, think about the people, you know who are at work, or at your church or the places you go to who are addicted to diet soda and tell them about this spread. This message. You may just save a life. I'll see you next week.\",\n",

The jaw becomes more prominent. Another striking feature of acromegaly is the significant enlargement of the hands and feet.  You read descriptions that patients with a grab bag. We have Spade like hands and Spade like feet, the fingers and toes. Get thickened and the palms and Soles widening. It thickened as well. Both acromegaly and acromegalic gigantism can result in severe disfigurement serious disorders such as heart problems and strokes and premature death if untreated  Doctors in the Ukraine were unable to perform a much-needed operation to remove Igor's brain tumor. Meaning he continued to grow. So when he was seven and already standing at 6 feet tall Igor, and his mom moved to America, where doctors were able to carry out the operation.  City is saved his life, but he still was growing after surgery for many more years. None of us expected that I always thought that after surgery. He will stop growing but his brain was already affected by tumor and still was producing growth hormone.  Igor eventually stopped growing when he was 20 years old.  But not until he'd hit an amazing. 7 feet. 8 inches, making him one of the tallest men in the world.  Gigantism has affected me. That I no longer feel that I fit into any part of society. And that's the feeling that I have had ever since I went into middle school and high school.  Eagle has recently enrolled at college to continue his education, which has been badly disrupted by his condition.  He's studying to become a lawyer and attends five classes a week.  I used to always sitting in the small chairs and sitting at small tables and it's uncomfortable, but I don't want to make it an extra fuss about it. So I'm used to bending over and sitting in the little chairs and writing at the little desks Eagles. School. Life has not always run smoothly. High, school was a terrible experience. All four.  Is of high school were just we're just incredibly harsh. I never had anybody to talk to during school or after school. I never sat with anybody at lunch, a high school is just a for miserable years, because I was just standing out in a crowd that it didn't fit into any group. Any social group. I felt like I was a nuisance to everybody in school despite his difficult experience during High School. The medical help Igor has received drives his desire to be a  Yeah, a lot of people have helped us over these years that we've lived here and I feel that more people should have the opportunity to receive the help that I did. Although his height means, he struggles to be accepted in his everyday life. As we'll see, Igor does make a big impression at the very highest level. I just want to make some special acknowledgements. The biggest Obama fan in the country is in the house.  Tanya Angus was a beautiful young girl.  She loved horse riding.  Swimming.  And dancing.  When I was younger, I did a lot of just normal kids stuff and I had a ball. I remember being little like it was yesterday.  With good looks and an outgoing personality. Tanya was always popular.  But as she got older, she started to notice unexpected changes in her body. My feet were getting bigger. I was out growing my mom's shirt. I knew something was wrong.  And that was good reason for tonya's unease because within a few short years, her body had changed beyond recognition and her life had turned upside down. This little girl. That was so happy so beautiful.  Had changed.  At 18 Tanya was 5 feet 8 and 10 and a half Stone.  Now age 31. She's six feet, eight and weighs nearly 32 Stone and she still growing, it's like I woke up one day and was Godzilla or you know, Andre the Giant.  Tanya was diagnosed with acromegaly at the age of 22. Her growth is caused by the same type of brain tumor that made Igor grow, massively tall, but unlike Igor Tanya continues to grow outwards and upwards which doctors claim is incredibly rare for someone diagnosed with acromegaly post puberty.  Kenna doesn't wear normal shoes, channa, doesn't wear clothes right off the rack. There's not a standard thing about her.  This is a hugely important week for Tonya, as she's due to visit her doctor to discover whether a new treatment. She's receiving is stopping her growth and potentially saving her life. I've fought my way this far. I can fight my way even farther.  27 year old Eagle valve. Kavinsky, suffers from gigantism and stands at a massive 7 feet. 8 inches his height means that every day things that other people take for granted become an issue for Igor. Even his transport.  We bought the car, almost new off the lot, and then we had to drop it off for about a month at a local chop shop, and they had to drop the floors in my car. Make them about six inches lower.  Well, equals height means he's well known around town. It's had a detrimental effect on his personal relationships. My social life has been affected drastically with my friends. I'm no longer able to go and do all the things they do. I have to usually stick to doing indoor things. All right, could I please get an original bacon cheese? Burger combo, his social life is certainly difficult issue for eager.  He never had many friends kids of his age. They cannot understand his problems, but he goes through how painful for him so he doesn't have my many friends.  Because of his size.

       " '7jBQIojzS0': \"To have later on this afternoon. It's a great privilege to be here and be with you, and, and share our hopes and trials and tribulations and progress in Senator treatments for the condition of diabetes. So, we're trying to get to a point where we have diabetes cured once and for all for a future for the future, but it's not easy to do that in one once well Fell Swoop. So, we've got several strategies and it's really a team and Global effort. It in diabetes research to try. And take the point where we  We have instant today and hopefully, no, injections no monitoring for the future. And I'll try and take you along that Journey cutting-edge eyelet and stem cell transplant treatments in the clinic for diabetes as we move forward today.  So diabetes, most of you will know what diabetes is, but just to start at the basics, diabetes is a condition where patients lose the ability to adjust, their blood sugar and there are two main types of diabetes are several subtypes, but two main types type one where the the pancreas basically has lost its ability to make insulin, the cells in the pancreas that make insulin are called islets of langerhans. And inside, those collections of cells that are beta cells. And those are the beta cells, are the ones that make insulin. So in someone who has Type  Diabetes. Then the body has basically destroyed those cells destroyed, the beta cells, inside the pancreas inside, the islets, that make instance, of the patients, have an absolute deficiency of insulin, and the other type of Diabetes, which of course, much more common and increasing in number as well. Is type 2 diabetes, where patients become resistant to insulin and therefore when they receive instant all the pancreas is making instant the body's needs for instance in are basically what the pancreas can.  Release is insufficient.  So diabetes is a very common condition. There are about 381 million people with diabetes in the world today based on the world estimates from the diabetes Federation, 2013 type 1 diabetes represents about 10% of the world population by 2030 this population with that were type 1. And type 2 diabetes will double so it's going to be a huge huge Health burden for the future. The national cost of diabetes in this country, in the us alone is greater than 2  Didn't 45 billion dollars estimated that last year and that increased from 174 billion dollars in 2007. And clearly with the massive increase in numbers of patients with diabetes. This is going to become uncontrollable and super saturate, the ability of Health Care Systems to deliver appropriate care. So instance, been around for a long time as some of you may know Banting best and this is Frederick Banting in the physiology, Laboratories in London, Canada.  De in 1920, when he was working on 1921 1922, when the team was working on the discovery of instant Banting, best collip, and the cloud and Insulin injection therapy, clearly has been life-saving for many, many patients, with type 1, and some patients, with type 2 diabetes. So injections of insulin from the outside can substitute for the pancreas is ability to make instant and we measure instant in the number of units. So most patients will take  20 30, 40 units of insulin a day and they measure the number of units of insulin as a crude amount. It was the amount of insulin needed one unit of insulin to cause hypoglycemia in a rabbit. That's how they originally discovered it when Banting. And Best will were working on this diabetes is a dangerous condition to have overall. Kidney. Failure is a problem, 25 times more risk than the general population heart attacks to 25 times more risk than the general population Strokes two to three times more risk.  And life expectancy of patients with with diabetes is at least 10 years shorter than the rest of the world without diabetes.  Diabetes is the leading cause of vision loss in working-age adults the commonest cause of end stage, kidney failure, and of non-traumatic lower-limb amputations because the blood vessels basically become destroyed when the body's glucose becomes, awry.  There's been lots of improvements in the treatment of diabetes over the course of time. As I mentioned before, the discovery of instant 1921. 1922. Diabetes was a fatal condition when Instinct was first tried in patients, it led to complications infection sepsis. Then, they've been various improvements in different types of insulin, short-acting, long time clock, acting action, insulin different ways of delivering instant over the course of time, including insulin pumps, including continuous blood glucose monitoring systems.  The whole idea here is to try to tighten up the sugar control. So that patients are less risk at risk of, getting the NCH, complications of diabetes, the micro and the macro complications of diabetes. And the reverse side of that equation, as we try to tighten up the control, is that patients, get much more of this condition, which is a Teatro genetic condition in other words caused by doctors, which is called hypoglycemia. So when the blood sugar Falls below a certain threshold and patients become susceptible because the brain requires absolutely requires glucose to  Function. As soon as the blood glucose drops with for certain below, a certain level, then the brain can no longer function.  So, islet cell transplantation. We has been around since the 1970s experimental e and first trials in patients happened in the 1980s. And really, it took off in 2000 and have been several done that. Now, I'm going to explain and tell you the story of islet transplantation shortly, but really are indications for islet transplantation. Have been to try to reduce this risk of hypoglycemia, reducing the risk of lows in patients, that are needing insulin.  So, why do we try to run the blood sugar low? This is really based on some large, very large trials. In patients with diabetes. We know from these curves. For example, as we try to tighten up, the blood sugar control. We can definitely reduce the risk of complications such as this one on the right called retinopathy, which is where the blood vessels in the back of the eye accelerating and grow and cause the blindness, but if as we tighten up the control, then patients are more and more at risk of getting lows. And we measure this by the glycated hemoglobin, which is it, which is a marker in the bloodstream.  The really tells you how good or bad the blood sugar control is over over several months. So here's a patient, that's wearing a state-of-the-art continuous glucose monitor, and you can see across day 1 and day 2. This patient has quite wide fluctuations in blood sugar control, and at 8:00 in the morning, on the second day. You can see the blood glucose drops. The patient is on their own, not monitored. And unfortunately patients found dead in bed at 9:00 an hour later from a fatal hypoglycemic.  Event and fortunate. This is relatively rare, but it does happen and it happens in young adults. With type 1 diabetes, that have poor control. Now. This is what we can achieve today with an islet cell transplant. In the lower panel here. You can see very wide fluctuations in blood sugar, over the course of time up, until that red arrow, where the patient receives an islet transplant. This is a transparent that she's done in Miami. Got a criminal record is shared this this slide and data with me, but it's very typical of what we can achieve.  He routinely with an islet cell transplant in here. You can see after the islet transplant, where the patient discontinues. Instant that blood sugar control. Becomes very tight is in the normal range or near normal range. The price of this. However, is that the patient needs, a procedure, small procedures are to receive cells and has to have immunosuppressive drugs in order for the body not to reject these cells are transplanted cells from organ donors, and they are therefore potentially foreign to the body. And also the process that cause diabetes in the process in the  The first place, which is an autoimmune process, meaning the body attacks itself, the, this will happen again after an islet transplant to the new cells, unless the anti-rejection drugs are given. So there's been real progress in and islet cell transplantation. I'll explain that to you, but I think we're somewhere along this hype cycle right now, perhaps somewhere along the slope of Enlightenment. We haven't got to navona yet. But we're trying to get there along the plateau of productivity, and still, I think, if you can read it and you can Google lots of  Negative reviews on islet transplantation because I think the knowledge in this area probably hasn't reached all of the community but where I'm sharing with you today, some of the progress, but there's been progress throughout diabetes and here, for example, is a trial that was just completed in September last year. Looking at a special insulin pump that switches off when the blood sugar reaches a certain low threshold that low glucose suspend. And when this is applied to patients, then the risk of the patients. Getting hypoglycemia is certainly a lot less than it would be.  Be otherwise. So there's been lots of progress and I'm also very excited this afternoon to meet with your Google contact lens team because I think the areas of monitoring for blood sugar control and our ability, to monitor the function of our cell. Transplant therapies overtime with this kind of Technology will be enormously informative and allow us to tighten up our control. Minimize the stress on the cells and allows all to learn a lot about controlling diabetes. So who do we offer an islet transplant to today? We have tutorial.  Major categories those with patients who are have an islet transplant alone. In other words. They haven't had a previous transplant. They have to have type 1 diabetes for more than 5 years. They have to fail on all the standard therapies, including insulin pumps. If available and we have various scoring systems. I won't dwell on that. The basically, the demonstrate that a patient has severe lows which despite that their ability to control the glucose as best they can and about five to ten percent of the population with type 1, diabetes at least in Canada would fulfill  These very strict criteria to justify adding immunosuppression and receiving a cell infusion.  The other side, the creation of patients that already have a successful transplant like a heart alone or in this case, a kidney transplant. So they're already on the anti-rejection drugs. So they don't have to face any additional risk, except from the minor risk of the procedure required to put the cells in an eyelid after kidney transplant. Our second category is is becoming a very successful Category 2  So we began with the Edmonton protocol in the year 2000. It didn't just begin from nowhere began from 30 years of research and small and large animal models, and a terrific collaboration with several International centers across across the world. And I think that's one of the Privileges involved in science. And, in diabetes research is that we have a very, very close-knit community of scientists working together, willing to share information and ideas to allow us all to get to them to the next step. And it probably is model. Very nice.  So in the Google or organization, so we published this in 2000. This is in the New England Journal of Medicine. Where I first seven patients, receiving eyelets under the Edmonton protocol that we called subsequently, the Edmonton protocol where all of the patients that had the transplants were able to come off insulin.\",\n",
       " '9Lsyg7lgHI': \"Over to you, Carly for an overview of the program and then we can open up the call for discussion. Great. Thank you so much. So hi everyone. Thanks so much for joining today. What I'm going to try to do in about 10 minutes or less, I'm hoping is to go over the highlights of what was finalized in the last round of rulemaking and what we intend to address and future rulemaking and also try to  Highlight some of the areas where we know you all had concerns about and had submitted comments. During our last rule making process. And what I'm hoping to do in the latter, half of the college, hear about the special diabetes program for Indians, learn more about it and how it intersects with MVP, or how it may intersect and also hear some of your concerns that may help.  And form our next round of rulemaking, there are several policy areas that we are intending to address in one more round before the benefit goes live in 2018. So with that, I'm going to start by just describing what was finalized in the last round of rulemaking for the benefit. So the mdp vents benefit was proposed to mirror the national DPT of closely as possible. What we were able to finalize in the  Last round was that the benefit would be a 12-month core benefit with optional maintenance sessions on an ongoing basis. We did finalize that this would be in a preventive service and clarified in the final rule that the benefit would not require any Co pay for eligible beneficiaries. We also finalized that the benefit would require the use of a a CDC approved Upp.  I'm not just one type of curriculum, but a CDC approved curriculum, either their standard or something that alternative that has been approved. And we also clarified that beneficiaries who are participating in the 12-month core benefit, do have access to the entire year of the core benefit. And then if they meet weight loss, the minimum weight loss in the last three months of the Court sessions, that they would be able to go.  On to ongoing maintenance sessions. We also finalized some aspects of the beneficiary eligibility criteria. Most of the criteria were finalized. So Benny's have to be enrolled in Medicare. They have to have a BMI of at least, 25 and 23 for those self-identified, as Asian. They have to present one of three of three blood tests, and they cannot have a previous history of diabetes, although,  National diabetes is okay. One of the things that we are intending to address in our next round of rulemaking, is what happens when a beneficiary is diagnosed with diabetes during the program, do they get? Kicked out what happens? So we do intend to address that. And our next round. We also heard from from the tribal organizations in particular, some concerns around the one per lifetime benefit restriction, and we did finalize this as  As a default policy, but we said in our final rule that we intend to address any exceptions to this restriction, in future rulemaking as needed. So that is something where we would like to hear some of the tribal organizations concerns around that policy. We also intend to propose a limit, to the ongoing maintenance sessions. We did hear a lot from commenters that this was not sustainable for their organizations to have  Maintenance sessions in perpetuity. So we do intend to propose a cap, and would be, well, we welcome your, your comment on that as well. We finalized our, our referral policy. So, no, referral is necessary for coming into the MVP. We also finalized that CDC recognition will be the basis upon which CMS will determine eligibility.  You for enrollment. We were able to finalize our proposal that an entity must have full recognition as a requirement to enroll and we were not able to finalize our original proposal around preliminary recognition because of because we weren't able to propose the specifics around the standard and the proposed rule. So we intend and we State this in the rules who proposed that preliminary standard as an interim, CMS standard in  Our next round, enrollment gains before the CD. CD PRP standards. Go into effect and we are doing this so that enrollments because we intend for enrollment to start begins beginning before 2018, that this CMS finalization of preliminary, standard will allow organizations that meet that standard to enroll before the new CDC standards, come into effect. So happy to answer any questions about that because I know it was  Source of confusion for a lot of commenters. We also finalized our proposed, screening level of high risk for on enrolling mdp suppliers. And this was also an area where I know he tagged and others that submitted letters within that campaign had some concerns and we are looking into our program Integrity manual. Which  Is also published to the public to try to better understand how this high risk, screening and fingerprinting applies to different organizations. And are hoping that we are able to get enough information to release and sub-regulatory guidance versus, you know, another round of rules, but we do recognize that this is a concern for many and are open to your thoughts on.  On how to communicate that policy. We also finalized we finalized part of our of supplier enrollment. Unfortunately, we were not able to finalize all of our policies regarding supplier. Enrollment. What we did finalized was that suppliers would enroll at the organization level and then the coaches upon enrollment the  Chance would submit a roster of their coaches and T.I.'s. So those are the National provider identifiers. So lifestyle. Coaches, as part of MVP would have to obtain npi's. And then, the MDT organization is upon enrollment, would have to submit those to CMS what we weren't able to finalize. Unfortunately, in this rule, round of rulemaking was, what then does CMS do with that information? And how does it impact enrollment or  Both at the beginning of enrollment and throughout the program. So we intend to propose specific more specifics around that in our next round of rulemaking, and we welcome your input on that as well.  I'm going to give over to some finalized policies around it infrastructure and capabilities. I know this is also an area of concern and we are really looking for some ways that we can be more proactive about providing technical assistance to suppliers of different types and know that this is an area that we, that is a concern for the tribal.  Asians, so with, you know, with our submission of claims policy, you know, it is a standard for Medicare to to use an electronic claim submissions. There are there are exceptions to that based and and you know, we can we can talk through and of your concerns about that and try to provide guidance around the exceptions in either, sub-regulatory, or future rulemaking. We also finalized  That suppliers would have to maintain medical records. That contain detailed documentation of the services furnished. The beneficiaries. We did not require the use of an EHR in this final rule. We know that a lot of organizations in this new type of service are not, you know, yet part of a larger Health Care system and may not have an electronic health record in place, and we are new to Medical.  Record keeping so that was something that we didn't require in this round of rulemaking and are open to your thoughts on that.  Other infrastructure and it capabilities policies that we finalized in this last round of rulemaking. Was that MDT suppliers would have to maintain and handle any PI. I and Phi and compliance with HIPAA and other privacy laws and CMS standards. So that's pretty you know, much in line with how existing providers and CMS operate.  And now I'm going to just quickly review the outstanding, the large kind of areas of outstanding policies that we weren't able to finalize in addition, to have the preferred policies that I highlighted as I was going through each of these different areas. So supplier enrollment is kind of, the biggest is one of the bigger ones, how the coach roster will affect the MVP supplier. We are planning to address that in our next round of rulemaking. And we also  We'll be proposing our payment structure. We did include it. The table of the reimbursement structure in our last round of rulemaking, but we didn't specifically. We didn't explicitly propose it. So in this case, we will take the comments that we received on that structure and respond to them in our next round of rulemaking and we are happy and welcome to hear the tribal organizations perspective on  On this current payment that was outlined. We will also be\",\n",

       " 'SCV_m91mN-Q': \"Got a case study for you. Let me tell you about Marie. She was a healthy woman in her late 30s. G2 always been an active person. But at some point, her energy level just seemed Limitless. She was walking the dog four times a day up at 5:00 in the morning, emailing her co-workers. And at midnight. She was still awake. Like dusting. The ceiling fans at first. She felt great. She was super productive. But soon, she started having trouble sleeping. She felt anxious all the time. She lost a lot of weight and notice that she felt hot and sweaty when no one around her. Did she started experiencing heart palpitations. And then one day, her vision seemed  Blurry and when she looked in the mirror, she was kind of surprised to find that her eyes were actually bulging out of their sockets. So yeah, she finally called a doctor because you know, bulging eyeballs Maria's doctor, referred her to an endocrinologist. Who after running some tests, determine that, the root of her problems was in her thyroid gland. The thyroid is one of the stars of your endocrine system. It's the little butterfly shaped structure, located anterior to your trachea and inferior to the larynx or voice box. It may look cute and unassuming, but don't be fooled. The powerful hormone.  That it produces influence some of your most important physiological processes. These are mountains and many others. Help maintain your chemical, homeostasis, the balance and concentrations of substances, like calcium sodium even water within very narrow ranges. So that your body can provide a consistent internal environment for your cells, your cells, and the proteins in them need that stable environment to function. So if your body loses its homeostasis to dramatically cellular function will stop. And as we say here on Crash Course, anatomy and physiology, you will  Stop being alive. So your thyroid helps you avoid such a Fate by secreting hormones that regulate many aspects of your body's homeostasis, like body temperature skin moisture and your blood levels of oxygen calcium and cholesterol. It should come as no surprise that if the thyroid malfunctions and produces too much or too little of a hormone. It can lead to all sorts of weird and serious symptoms and yet thyroid disorders and the hormonal imbalances, that accompany them are pretty common. It's pretty likely that, you know, at least one person most likely a woman who has experienced an issue with a dysfunctional thyroid and  More of us are walking around with thyroid disorders and haven't even been diagnosed. Yet, in Murray's case. It turns out that she had Graves disease, an immune system disorder that results in the over production of thyroid, hormones, or hyperthyroidism. Although it's just one type of hormone disorder. Looking at her symptoms can help us understand. Just how important influential and interconnected hormones are and why they need to be properly, balanced to maintain healthy homeostasis. And I cannot say this enough, homeostasis is life.  Last time we talked about hormone Cascades and how a lot of the hormone activity that's bubbling, along inside of you, is the result of one kind of hormone bossing around the cells. That produce another kind of hormone. These Pathways typically start with an internal stimulus often coming from the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. And, and in the Target glands that release hormones into the blood to get. The real work of living done. You seen how this kind of cascade controls. Your body's stress response through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal Axis or HPA axis. Basically your brain tells  Hypothalamus to tell your pituitary to light a fire in your adrenal cortex. And in no time. They've shut down digestion. Released a bunch of energy, increase your blood pressure and everything else. You need to either fight or flee and that's great. Your HPA axis is super useful when you are under stress and need to take action. But you do not need your adrenal cortex spouting off all the time through this much of the more basic, more fundamental business of everyday, life is carried out by a different kind of cascade. It's the hypothalamus pituitary, thyroid, Axis, or HPT.  Yes, and it's what set the thyroid gland in the motion. So it can regulate just about everything related to your homeostasis. For example, let's say you're caught outside on a cool day and you're underdressed. So let's say you were on a bus busily texting your bestie and you got off at a stop while searching for the Emoji that most accurately depicted your reaction to the new Avengers movie. When you realized that, you left your jacket on the seat. There's nothing you can do to get your jacket back, but your hormones can do something about your coldness. Now, you're nervous system, of course, has its own ways of detecting and signaling a change.  Temperature. But your endocrine system gets involved. As soon as it senses that the temperature of your blood has changed your cooler than normal blood flows into your brains hypothalamus where it bumps up against temperature-sensitive Sensory neurons, which act like a kind of thermostat. Once they detect that the temperature is below Target levels. Those neurons secrete thyrotropin-releasing hormone, or trh into the bloodstream. Trh is a Tropic hormone, which means that it gets the hormone Cascade started by triggering the release of other hormones. The Cascade starts off with just a trickle as tea.  RH goes just a few millimeters to the anterior pituitary where it hits receptors on cells. They're causing it to release thyroid stimulating hormone, or TSH into the bloodstream that then travels down to the thyroid Finds, Its receptors and slaps, the Glam to attention. So it releases its own special thyroid hormone into the blood where it can affect virtually every cell in your body, like steroids. Thyroid hormone is lipid soluble. So it crosses the membrane of its Target cell to bind. Inside the nucleus, there. It can make the cell either increase decrease or maintain its primary.  Function in this case, since you feeling chilly, your body needs to stoke the fire a bit and it does that by burning glucose. You cells. Burning glucose really means breaking it down. So, its component, parts can be used to produce ATP thyroid. Hormone comes into play. When it binds to receptors inside the nuclei of your muscle cells triggering, the transcription of DNA, that makes the enzymes to break down that glucose with more of these enzymes following around more glucose is being broken up and more ATP is being produced which is all a long way of describing the process that we call metabolism, but since the  The thyroid has increased the amount of chemical reactions going on. At also increase the amount of waste heat that's being generated. So this process has a cal orogenic or heat producing effect that helps warm you up. Now whether or not you happen to forget your jacket on the bus and found yourself shivering. On the way to work, your thyroid, hormone produces all kinds of other effects as well, like, maintaining your blood pressure. Promoting the growth of tissues and triggering the secretion of digestive juices, to keep food, moving through your digestive tract, just to name a few, so thyroid hormone for the win, right?  What's not to love? Well, what's important about the whole HTP axis is not just how it works. But also how it knows to turn off your glands, need negative feedback in order to know when their job is done. So they can stop secreting certain hormones. That's where your pituitary and hypothalamus come in. Remember, they're always monitoring hormone levels in your blood. If there's too much thyroid hormone, they both decrease their own hormone production to stop stimulating, the thyroid that in turn reduces thyroid hormone levels in the blood and it slows down your metabolism. Again before you get overheated. At least. That's what  And if everything is working the way it should, but there are millions of Marie's out there, plenty of people, maybe even including you who know full well that hormonal imbalances thyroid-related or otherwise happen all the time. Why? Well, thyroid disorders can be caused by lots of things. But in the case of our Marie, it's auto immune dysfunction. Normally, when you get sick with the virus or bacteria or what-have-you your immune system responds by sending out antibodies that Target those Invaders. Now, we don't fully understand why yet, but if you have something like Graves disease, your body produces abnormal.  Is that Target the cells of your thyroid gland itself and instead of marking those cells for Destruction like antibodies normally do they do something even more bizarre. They mimic the hormones that the pituitary gland sends out which bind to the thyroids receptors. So even though the pituitary dials down, its hormone production in an effort to get the thyroid to stop, the thyroid, does not get the message because the receptors are still being activated. Basically the glands, never receives any negative feedback. So it just won't quit and if your thyroid doesn't stop it's hard for you to  Stop. So that's why Murray was always hot and sweaty her hypothalamus was screaming that she was warm enough, but those antibodies were hijacking, the hormone Cascade and she was losing weight, even though she was eating all the time because the thyroid hormone was no longer regulating her metabolism properly. But what about those big bulging eyes? Remember those? That was weird. Well, because they're part of the immune response, those disruptive antibodies often. Cause inflammation particularly in the tissues, around the eyes in some cases, the swelling can be so severe that the eyes are no longer able to close treatment for Graves disease.  Is involves either inhibiting the production of thyroid hormones or blocking their effects. Basically getting your body chemistry back in order. The moral of the story is that hormones mean business and by business, I mean living and by living what I really mean is and everybody say it together now. Homeostasis in addition, to learning to respect your hormones and thanking them for helping you live. Hopefully, today you learned something about chemical homeostasis and took away a greater understanding of hormone Cascades. Specifically, we looked at the hypothalamus pituitary, thyroid Axis, or 8.  PT axis and all the ways. Your body can suffer when that system or your hormones. In general, get out of whack.

       " 'SDzJKaBvOGw': \"Years and years. This big tree is called metabolic syndrome are insulin resistance syndrome. And if the major illnesses of today were pictured as a tree, then insulin resistance and its partner in crime chronically. High insulin levels could be pictured as the root of this tree.  From this root Springs up the trunk of the tree.  And the trunk of the tree could represent all the Vicious Cycles of problems that go on for years and years and your body without you knowing about them. All of these processes are caused by or made worse by chronically, High insulin levels either directly or indirectly.  These Vicious Cycles are both caused by this continuously High insulin and in turn, feed back and cause high insulin levels to become even higher. And last longer, all these go on for years, setting you up to become sick, fat and hurting.  Then, you know, we could look up into this tree and see the many branches growing out of the trunk of unnoticed problems. Growing into open outward branches of disease.  All the branches have names that we've all heard about or even worse that we've been diagnosed. With all these branches, have disease seem like separate unrelated problems. They affect different people differently.  You might be on the type 2 diabetes, Branch your husband on the heart disease. Branch your daughter on the polycystic ovarian. Syndrome Branch. Your mother may have fatty liver and she's on a branch to it's even possible with some of the newer science of the last few years that your sister who has breast cancer and your grandma who has Alzheimer's, might be on one of these branches to  Then you might be on this tree but not on one of the branches. You might be hourly healthy right now, but you found out from your doctor that you had high triglycerides. Guess what? You're on this tree to, but you're still down in the trunk. You're in the trunk of this tree.  Your problem hasn't sprung out and grown into an outward Branch yet. You might be in the trunk of this tree. If you have low HDL cholesterol, too.  The same can be said, if you have high blood pressure, at least 50% of you who have high blood pressure also have high insulin at the root of your tree. Maybe you found out that your blood sugar is slightly high or even fairly high. You're in the trunk of this tree, too.  Maybe you've been getting fatter around the middle every year. Well, chances are, you're in the trunk of this tree to because belly fat is the best sign that you have chronically High insulin levels at the root of your tree.  Are there signs that you might be in the trunk of this tree are maybe the your doctors put you on blood thinners, because a thickening blood.  Is a sign that you have a chronically High insulin level at the root of your tree.  Even though you're fairly healthy hourly. It's very probable that you're still on this tree. Your problem has, just not branched out into open disease. Yet, High insulin levels exist in our body for years and years causing and being caused by many other problems. Like the resistance of certain tissues to the effects of this High, insulin, level and resistant, tissues, both being caused by high insulin.  Bubbles and in turn fading back and causing more High insulin to be made increasing obesity getting fat, being caused by high insulin levels, making fat storage easier and also by increasing fat tissue itself, becoming eventually resistant to insulin and therefore causing more insulin to be made.  Being fat around the middle is the number one clue that you have chronically, High insulin levels. As you get fatter your fat cells themselves, become insulin resistant and cause your body to have to make more insulin, the fatter. You become the more resistance, the more resistance higher, the insulin levels, which continue to feed back, making it easier to store more fat. Folks. This is a true vicious cycle.  L High insulin causes your body to store more of what you eat is fat. And the increasing fat itself, feeds back becomes resistance to insulin and causes your insulin levels to go up, which causes you to store more fat. You see, it's a very vicious cycle. Like all these problems are very Vicious Cycles. The indirect effect of all, this insulin is a large amount of inflammatory chemicals this increasing fat tissue produces.  Increasing widespread inflammation in your body, your fat cells themselves, produce inflammatory chemicals and they cause inflammation to increase throughout your entire body from your joints to your circulatory system. All through your body and we can carry the same cause and effect cycling to the liver. It is the liver that your insulin resistance problem. You're chronically, High insulin level problem becomes deadly, your body can only  Store so much carbohydrates, so the liver converts the extra carbs into fat.  That tends to stay in the liver and also export. Some of those carbs turned into fat into the blood as triglycerides as your liver becomes fatter. It also becomes more resistant to insulin. This causes your insulin levels to rise and worse than that. Stay higher all the time, all these processes, all these vicious spinning Cycles travel together and cluster together, and people who are fat.  Or who have heart disease or who have type 2, diabetes or high triglycerides or fatty liver or high blood sugars or even polycystic, ovarian syndrome. The question of which of these is a real root of this tree.  Could be better understood if we thought about the old philosophy, question, which came, first, the chicken or the egg? If all these processes are like the old which came first, the chicken or the egg debate, then they are really a circle or a feedback loop or a chain of cause and effect, a cycle of spinning events.  All these processes become an endless, which came first, the chicken or the egg debate with no right answer. Because the chicken lays the egg and the egg hatches, a chicken, you know, insulin resistance causes insulin levels to go up and insulin levels, going up, causes insulin resistance to become worse, a true feedback loop  If there is any part of these Cycles, we could step in and stop. If there was any weak Link in the chain, then the spinning cycle of cause and effect will stop. So, when we look at the root of our tree, we could pick out a chicken. All we can pick out an egg that fuel these vicious cause and effect cycles, and we could fry that chicken or we can scramble that egg and the whole cycle of cause  Effect will begin to be broken. Now that we've looked at the branches of this tree. Let's go down into the roots and look at what causes insulin to become chronically high. And what you can do about it, insulin is released when you eat period.  It doesn't matter what you eat when you eat insulin is released. This is completely normal. As we all know, some foods and drinks, Spike insulin, more than others, some much more than others, but eating causes insulin to be released period. Also, some of us just by being born to the parents, we have and inheriting certain genes are just more prone to becoming insulin resistant.  Which, as we've said, insulin resistance and chronically, High insulin are traveling partners in crime.  Another cause of insulin being high, is our lifestyle. Do we snack a lot? Do we constantly drink sugary drinks and all we active or couch potatoes. All these things, get the insulin resistance and chronically High insulin levels started, but this isn't the problem.  If having a high insulin level after a meal or two was the problem, we all be in trouble fast, but insulin levels after a single meal is not the problem. The root of our tree is chronically constantly consistently High insulin levels.  The insulin problem Builds on itself in a vicious cycle. So continuously snacking and overeating and sucking on a sugary drink all day for years, causes insulin levels to remain higher than they would have. And last longer than it would have the more insulin and the laundry Remains the more resistance to insulin which leads to higher and higher levels of insulin.  The fatter you become the higher, the insulin resistance, and your tissues and the higher your resistance. The higher you're chronically. High insulin levels go.  This vicious cycle, builds over the years and has some point. Your insulin levels become so high and last so long and remain constantly and chronically high that you no longer need to eat much of anything to maintain a high insulin level. Even while you sleep your fatty insulin resistant, liver is making sugar because it no longer feels the effects of this High insulin level.  The trunk of this tree Springs out into open.\",\n",

       " 'Ln6OoH12uY': \"Hey everybody. It's doctor Jo. And today, I'm going to show you the top 5 ways to relieve pain for peripheral neuropathy and other foot ailments. So, let's get started. Disclaimer alert disclaimer alert.  Number one. Calf stretches for the calf stretch. You can use a strap a stretching strap. You can use a belt. If you have a dog, you can use a dog leash or just a big towel, but I like the ones that have the loops and them because you want to just place it kind of around the ball of your foot with a calf stretch. You want your leg to be straight. So bent, like this isn't going to quite stretch the calf. So if you want to do it sitting down you can I have a whole bunch of different ways to stretch.  And you can check that video out but just sitting in a chair, bring your leg up. So it's straight and pull with the strap. So you want your foot to be relaxed and then just pull until you feel a stretch through that cap area. You're going to hold that stretch for about 30 seconds and then relax it take just a little quick 10, second break, and then stretch again. So you're going to do that a total of three times. For 30 seconds. Number two, far infrared, heat.  Eat, ooh, the folks at therm attacks partnered up with us and they sent us their Platinum Thermo text and this far infrared heat is super cool because what it does is it goes deeper it penetrates deeper into the body. So usually with a normal heating pad it only goes maybe Point 25 cm. This one goes all the way up to 6, cm or 2 point 3, 6 inches, so it goes down deeper in there. It doesn't dry out the skin. It doesn't dehydrate you and it uses  Instead of heat. So this is really really cool. And I like the Platinum a lot.  Because this one is very versatile. You can use it kind of for any part of your body. It has the three heat plates here. So it really molds around everything and I like it for the foot, and especially for peripheral neuropathy diabetic neuropathy, but you can also use it for plantar fasciitis, hammertoes, fallen arches, just author, itís in general, or even sprains and strains down here. So, you put your foot on the middle.  Foot plate there and then you can just bring this up almost like a sea around the foot. It doesn't necessarily have to be super tight because it penetrates so deeply that you can just put it Loosely around your foot. And so the Platinum you can see here has a lot of ways you can use it. If you're interested in, finding out more about the Platinum. You can check out my full review of the Platinum by clicking the box in the top right hand corner, or you can check it out in the description below. There will be a link down there as well. Also, if you want to be more specific with the foot,  put they have a little foot covering here, which is really nice. And I like this because not only is it cute but you can stick your feet in like this and it kind of encases the feet so you can do them both at the same time. And again, you can just have it and be working on something or watching TV and it is cool because if you have peripheral neuropathy or some kind of other nerve issue where you don't really have sensation in your feet. There's a pad and  Here that you can add in, so it doesn't get that heat quite directly on there since you can't feel it. So you can use it all the time and there if you want to. But if you want a little bit more heat, that you can feel, you can take this out while you're using it and I have some circulation issues in my feet where my feet are cold all the time. And so I like this just to have on my feet to keep that circulation going especially when it's cold outside. It makes it really nice.  And if you're interested in purchasing the product, you can go to Thermo tex.com or click in the link below in the description. Number three, ankle pumps for ankle pumps. You just want to put your foot out. If you want to prop it up on, something you can but make sure that your heel is free moving. So it's not actually on the thing that's propped up. Or you can just stick your foot out like me and then you're just going to pull up and push down. So just pumping that ankle.  Increase that circulation to the area and works those muscles. So just start off with about 10 of these and you can work your way up to 20 to 25 really pushing down as far as you can and pulling up number 4, heel toe raises for seated heel toe raises. Just place your feet flat on the ground and then come up on your toes, come down and then pull your toes up. So pushing up this way and then pull.  Pulling up this way. Again. Just starting off with, about 10 to 15 of these and then working your way up to 20 to 25. If they become easy, then you can do them standing up, number five, the balance exercises for balancing. Make sure when you start off you have something sturdy like a countertop or a sturdy chair. Hold on. And then just stand on one foot start off. Like I said, making sure that you're holding on the whole time. Just go to  10 to 15 seconds. Once you can work your way up to 30 seconds to a minute and that's easy. Then just try a holding on with a finger on each side. And then if that becomes easy, then just one finger and then eventually just trying to balance on one foot and make sure you're switching sides back and forth. So you're getting both sides. So there you have it. Those were the top five ways to relieve peripheral neuropathy or other foot ailments.

The pancreatic islet transplantation or what is known as the Edmonton protocol is an experimental procedure that makes use of eyelets extracted from the pancreas.

The beta cells of these transplanted islets are expected to produce the insulin lacked by the type 1 diabetes patient.

Or type 1 diabetes, although clinically promising at first a 5-year follow-up after the transplantation procedure was made and the results were not as favorable as expected. Only 10% of the patients remained free of insulin dependence while the rest went back to the use of insulin shots, since the transplanted islets eventually lost its ability to produce insulin.

       " '-IOqAzf7k': \"The diagnostic criteria is have having based on the Rotterdam criteria is having either two of these three symptoms. So, an ovulation or a ligament area, which means having periods that are irregular. So either having more than one period per month or having periods, like, Miss Cycles, or long cycles of six weeks or more. The average female menstrual cycle is about 26 to 34 days. So, having periods outside of that, kind of  Will range. Could indicate one of the symptoms of PCOS. The other one is something called hirsutism, which is caused by high androgens or male sex hormones like testosterone or DHEA and some of the symptoms of that are acne. So hormonal acne like that. Those pustular cystic acne that happens around the chin and jawline or the chest and back and and hirsutism which is the male pattern hair growth, which is great.  If you're a woman to have which is sort of hair and on the mustache and Chin, so you kind of sport a Frida Kahlo mustache and probably have to do with that. When the regular similarly having hair loss on the scalp is another sign, right? So what do you think of men? Men will typically experienced male pattern, hair growth or hair loss and in hair growth in the facial area. When the third symptom is the presence of cysts on the ovaries, which is diagnosed or cited with a transvaginal.  Ultrasound. There's a scope Place through the vagina and then an ultrasound is used to see if there's cysts on the ovaries. It can also be diagnosed with lab work. So that's not using the Rotterdam criteria. But there are two hormones of the brain makes that control the ovaries and these are called FSH the follicle stimulating hormone and LH luteinizing hormones. The brain makes these hormones and they tell the ovaries went to ovulate and the ovaries. Also make LH luteinizing hormone it.  They've been ovulated or after the corpus luteum forms after ovulation should happen. So whether it's for the egg is fertilized or not, the corpus luteum will form  And so PCOS is is probable when you order labs and find that. So the FAA FSH and LH should be almost the same. So we should be at a one-to-one ratio. And PCOS is suspect when the lh2 FSH ratio is 21 or higher. So you have either two or more times the LH that you have FSH and this is because in PCOS, the the ovaries will secrete a lot more LH.  And that is one of the reasons one of the hypotheses weather's high androgens because the LH can stimulate Androgen growth.  So there's there's a skinny PCOS. So these are women with with those symptoms that don't experience obesity or metabolic syndrome. And then there's the metabolic syndrome, type of PCOS. And in these patients, there's an insulin resistant, present or glucose intolerance. And so these women are they'll frequently experience hypoglycemic, crashes. They'll also probably be on the obese side and really struggled to keep weight off and they'll experience those that low energy the cravings for carbs.  They'll experience, you know, the hunger that comes two hours after a meal despite having eaten an adequate amount of fat and protein. And this is really problematic for them because they're, they're, you know, they're set up for diabetes and for cardiovascular disease, down the line and then they're also experiencing symptoms of obesity. And they're, you know, they're not super happy with how they look.  And we're not exactly sure what causes PCOS in women. There's a there's evidence for being heritable. So genetically passed on there's evidence for being caused by an insulin, just regulation and perhaps the ovaries are not responding properly to insulin. What insulin does is it helps our us take in fuel or glucose into our cells and just like all the cells in our body, the ovaries require insulin to absorb glucose that they can function properly.  So one of the theories of PCOS is that the ovaries are resisting insulin and the insulin is signaling them to grow, but they're growing in the absence of proper fuel. A proper glucose is fuel, and so, they're creating these follicles of these cysts.  And so, you know, so absence of periods are irregular periods, male pattern, hair growth, obesity, infertility. And then the presence of cysts on the ovaries are all are all symptoms of PCOS. So when we're trying to get a diagnosis, will send patients in for a transvaginal. Ultrasound will also look at their fasting, blood glucose, and fasting insulin will look at their progesterone in their estrogen because often times these women are suffering from estrogen dominance. So, there's low progesterone.  And high estrogen relation to the levels of progesterone will get their FSH and their LH. And I'll also, you know, check out their thyroid because often times the symptoms of hypothyroidism and PCOS are overlapping. And so I want to find out if there's a thyroid pathology happening in the back room.  So one of the main reasons that women will come in with PCOS is because they're trying to get pregnant or they want to preserve their fertility in the future. They might come in for acne issues or you know, the hair growth or just a sort of their periods. But the main reason that they come in as fertility and forty percent of women with PCOS do experience, infertility or fertility challenges. So this is a big big issue for them.  and the reason I love treating PCOS in my practice is well, I find that and this is sort of  Perhaps not technical or scientific, but I find that the the personality of women with PCOS tends to be more flim attic. So they're usually more agreeable and happier and you know in patients that really want to do good work. So that's really enjoyable to work with them. But also, the reason I love treating and working with patients with PCOS is because there's so many effective strategies that naturopathic medicine offers and I don't see an equal amount of strategies in the conventional system.  I'll talk a little bit about some of the conventional therapies of PCS. So,  What happens is in conventional therapies? They kind of look at the symptoms in in the syndrome spectrum and they kind of try and deal with each symptom individually. So they look at irregular periods and they'll prescribe a birth control pill. It's like, okay. Well, we'll just override your own hormonal production and will you know control your periods and get you cycling regularly, which obviously doesn't treat the underlying hormonal imbalance because you're just placing exoticness fake hormones on top of the picture or they'll say, okay. There's blood sugar just regular  Nation. So, I'm going to prescribe a diabetic medication called metformin, which will help re sensitize your cells to insulin, which again, not the best strategy. Although there's some evidence to support that this helps. But we're not again. Treating underlying issue of insulin resistance and Metformin is pretty toxic, 20 sites or variant cells. So when you're treating infertility, you're not setting the body up for healthy ovulation and producing a healthy a healthy baby. So and Metformin  You know, and then we have, you know, they'll treat the hyperandrogenism symptom that the hirsutism symptoms. The hyper engine is MM, bye-bye. Prescribing spironolactone or Yaz or Yasmin birth control pills that block androgens and again, you know, not the best strategy because it's not treating the underlying cause and there's some evidence that Yaz and Yasmin are one of the one of the oral contraceptive pills that set you up for a higher risk of blood, clots complete compared to other ones. So women who are taking this on.  I'm just slightly higher than normal or higher than compared to other birth control. Pills risk of, you know, pulmonary embolisms and deep vein thrombosis, and those kind of blood clotting issues, which are, which could be fatal. So that's an issue, right? And again, not treating the underlying cause  So yes, there's not that many great therapies and they're not holistic. They're not looking at the whole picture and a lot of that they're kind of reactionary and they're just treating the symptoms, you know, and then in terms of fertility, so women will undergo IVF treatments or they'll be prescribed ovulation drugs like fluid, which increase estrogen and get your body, ovulating, kind of force ovulation happen and again, can be an issue because these women with PCOS or having sometimes an estrogen dominance picture. So there  To Jane is high in relation to their low progesterone. And so adding more sort of estrogen promoting drugs, like climate could just like, you know, make life mental and emotional disaster for these women while they still have the drug in their body. It happened to a lot of women, but again, not the best issue. It might achieve the end goal of getting pregnant or increasing your chances, but we're not looking at what's going on. And so what happens is when I first see a patient with PCOS will run the laughs. We're all get the lab set their family doctor.  After his run, if that was done recently. And we'll take a look at all of their symptoms, will ask them how their periods are and if they're get PMS symptoms and you know, how often their periods common, like it them to track their periods. So that I can see, are they happening regularly and they're just very far apart or they all over the place. We'll look at their FSH and LH to see if they have that kind of classic High, LH and FSH ratio, and we'll look at their insulin and their fasting blood glucose and they're just Ostrom  Now, have some about symptoms, like, acne and hair growth, and we'll talk about, you know, weight loss, and if they're getting those hypoglycemic or insulin resistance symptoms.  And we'll talk about mood and emotions and digestion as well, which I talked about with all my patients and in energy and things like that because we want to get a holistic picture and we want to, you know, the reason that when I treat people I'm treating from the premise that it's possible to be healthy and we can influence our health and I the more I kind of examine Healthcare and Healthcare model. That is conventional. I the more I doubt that that's the premise that they're standing on right there. Kind of looking at  Making symptoms manageable or maybe achieving outcomes or end goals, or preventing death and things like that, but they're not coming at health conditions from a place of this person can influence the situation that they're in through targeting, you know, and in trying to understand the root cause and what's going on. And then, you know, and then treating that  So that's where I'm coming at. I'm looking at the whole picture and I'm trying to understand this person's unique hormonal imbalance and what the symptoms are the Manifest from that.  And with PCOS, so, then then it comes to choosing a treatment plans. There's lots of treatment that have a robust amount of evidence surrounding them. Right? And so, you know, you'll frequently hear people say that naturopathic.\",\n",

I work a lot, you know less exercise, you know you paying less attention and then the one day you realize I'm a little tired what's going on, you know, also we noticed that I was sweating very very little and I was very susceptible to heat then I would basically get very very tired and like hit a wall after this multiple series of blood  Best through the local doctors we decided to go to Stanford to see what we can do. Mr. Leader. Eric was referred to as really because of the fatigue but also because his primary care physician noticed that his blood pressure was changing quite a bit when we examine him in the clinic few things were striking first. His pupillary reaction was not as we expected and his skin was unusually dry, and we happen to evaluate him here during a very hot day so he clearly had issues with perspiration.  Ian and then we measured his blood pressure again, and we had them lay down for about 10 minutes to them up and there was a persistent drop in his blood pressure. Dr. Girardi pretty much right away felt. It probably was something I had to do with the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is the part of the nervous system that controls all the vital functions and the organs that are independent of our own will for us.  The reason why your heartbeat is independent of your with the range of the autonomic disorders and be fairly wide as you might expect the most common problems. We find our first problems in patients who cannot stay upright for a watch sometimes patients present with unexplained arrhythmias where the heart, you know palpitates like crazy. The other presentation usually is patients who have major digestive issues. Then heat tolerance can be a problem.  Is it because if somebody cannot sweat it's very difficult for them to be out in the heat. They can develop heat stroke fairly quickly testing. These patients requires an integrated approach which is not available in many areas during the first meeting. He asked have you ever been treated for Lyme disease? And I said absolutely not so we went through that right away. And of course we discovered right then that I had Lyme disease for probably five to 10 years, so he wanted me to  Be on antibiotics to write it Kate the different markers of Lyme disease now do not have any more Lyme disease, but it was clear. However that I did have a autonomic nervous disorder of sorts. We believe that we found the cause and we're trying to address it and then we basically worked with him a regimen what we give him medication that could help him with the sweating function. And in fact, he has noticed some benefit from that. We also started giving him medication that attenuate  Or completely eliminate hopefully the drop in his blood pressure and we'll watch and see how he does. It definitely has all the information and he deals with obviously more difficult cases. I think we probably have stabilized his condition at this point. It seems to be pretty confined. And in fact couple of signs may be better. I'm fairly optimistic think we will regain more function the next two years. I feel in good hands. There is no doubt.\",\n",
       " 'WN13pKVp9s': \"And it's represented in this picture.  Now, you might think, why is a soldier talking about? A young man who is obviously inactive and perhaps is a little bit overweight and it's because of some things I've seen in the last several years. And I'd like to talk a little bit about those today and related to how I believe it could be a national security threat within the next 20 to 30 Years. First of all, in 1983, the Army sent me on something called a broadening experience.  I was asked to go to graduate school at Indiana University. I had studied as an undergraduate international relations, but they said, hey, we want you to go and take get a masters degree in exercise physiology and then teach PE at West Point.  So I said, okay sounds like your great idea. It's broadening to be sure and I went out there. I went to Indiana University and my first class was an anatomy class and I had an anatomy lab. I walked into the classroom and they told me they issued me a cadaver as they did. Everyone else in the class. And the cadaver. I had came with a medical history. The professor told us. Hey in order to respect the people who have given their bodies to science. We'd ask you to respect them too. And you perhaps  Name them to remind yourself that they were once a person, although we don't want to give you their real name. So I named mine Charlie Charlie had a medical history. He had been to pack a day smoker. Charlie had not exercised in the last 20 years. Charlie was extremely overweight, and Charlie had died of a cardiovascular disease and he was 46 years old.  When we pull them up and we began the very students in the room, began our dissection of these bodies. I had a lot tougher time than some of the other students because I had to cut through several layers of Adipose. When I got to the internal body cavities. It was amazing. To me comparing Charlie's organs to some of the organs of the other students. In the class. The heart was surrounded by fat. Several inches. One of the tricks, our instructors taught us was if you know, we had to go through these Labs where you had to name, what? Vein was  In what artery was which and the professor said hey, if you if you pull on an artery, it's like a rubber band. If you pull on a vein, it's like a guitar string and it'll tank. Well when I pulled on Charlie's arteries and veins, they broke off into my hands.  So I finished grad school went to teach at West Point for three years from 83 to 86. And then after that assignment, I went back to the operational army and do things and did things at all soldiers, do commanded organizations. Trained went to combat several times and then coming out of combat, as a division commander in 2009, the Army decided, they wanted to promote me to three star general. I think, because they wanted to prove that they have a sense of humor and then they sent me, they then sent me.  To be the commander of initial military training. My job was to train the hundred and sixty thousand or so. Soldiers are Corrections civilians that would come into the army every year and turn them into soldiers. What I found when I reported that assignment. Disturbed me several facts, came to my attention. First of all, 75%.  Are more little bit more actually of the soldiers of the civilians who wanted to join the Army. We're not qualified to do to do. So 75% of the 17 to 24. Year-olds. It wanted to join the Army. We're not qualified. And the number one reason was because they were obese of the 25% that could join the Army. What we found on the first day of basic training, was it about 60% of them could not pass the PT test that we gave on the first day.  And that was one minute of push-ups, one minute of sit-ups and a 1-mile run. Now, that's not a difficult test, but we were finding the great majority of our new soldiers coming off the civilian environment. Could not pass that test.  I couldn't understand what had happened. This was not what I had left, studying physical education in 1986.  As we did some analysis. I realized that a couple things had changed. First of all number one and the primary reason was starting in the late 90s, the majority of our Elementary and high schools. Stop teaching PE. And in fact only five states of the 50 on our country right now have mandatory requirements for physical education, between K and 12 grade today.  Five out of 50. Now you say okay. Well, that's interesting. But what is the Army care about that? Well, we were getting the product of that. But in addition the second and third order effects were young, people that were joining. Our service could not run Dodge, jump, tumble roll, the kinds of things, you expect soldiers to do if they're in combat. The second thing, we found well our that I found or realized was that our diet had changed radically in the last 15 years.  We were super sizing everything having been stationed overseas in Germany. That's not the case there, but they were super size. If you want two large fries, you could get extra large and extra extra large. You couldn't just get a 69 strength. You could get a 24:42 64-ounce soda, and that was having a deleterious effect. It was fascinating to me that we were also seeing scientist told me that in the last 15 years. From the time. I left West Point until today, Americans eat about 30.  Percent more calories a day than they had in 1983 and about 15 pounds. More of sugar, a year phenomenal statistics, but the combination of a lack of physical education, and increase of poor nutrition was causing secondary effects. This is the oh Food Group by the way, okay, and I called it started calling it. The Old food group, because anything that ends in o is probably not good for you.  So, we, I haven't found anything that ended in old yet. That was actually very nutritious in nature. But what we started to do was, we saw some second and third order effects and this is one of them. This is at one of our training bases, and we have five in the United States Army. We were seeing a malady called femoral neck, stress injuries. And what that means is that the tip of the pelvis would crack and  Wouldn't be a clean break, but it would be a stress fracture that would cause significant problems. And you can see starting in 2000 that we were beginning to see this and this was because the people we were recruiting, we're just coming of age. And many of them had not had the PE and they had started to have the bad nutrition but by 2009 when our new recruits were 18 or 19 years old, they had gone through their entire life without having a PE class and dependent on bad nutrition. Those hundred and thirty-five that we had.  At one training base are significant injuries. Because in order to fix it, it cost anywhere between 100,000 to 300,000 dollars.  So this is an economic issue. This isn't just a soldier health issue for me. This was an economic issue.  The third reason, and I'll say this and then move quickly. On the third reason, we saw was an increase in technology. Now. I'm a big fan of Technology, but the researchers that have told me that we now watch as a Nation, about 150 hours of Television a month. That's five hours a day in 2009. When we started this study. We were seeing anywhere from 30 to 40 on average, hours of internet searches by adult male. Americans are adult male Americans per month.  That's between one and two hours a day gaming, was off the charts in 2009 and its increased. Since then, the average teenager was playing 13 hours of video game per week.  Now, all those hours in front of a tube were replacing the Playtime and that's significant in addition to that the final one. Number four is, we're terrible examples to our children. We are in too much of a rush. We are eating poorly. We're eating fast foods. We're relaxing in front of the television, at the end of the day. We also are relying on technology instead of play and we're not balancing Our Lives. My wife has a Stitchery in our  Out as we raised two children, and now a couple of grandchildren that says your children are watching you, what you do speaks louder than anything. You can say, we were not doing the right things for our children. So in typical Army fashion, I said, we've got to address these issues with our new recruits and we changed several things. We began something. We called the soldier athlete initiative, because you can't just say to a bunch of 18 year olds. Hey, we're going to get you all in shape and stop feeding your cheese.  He's Burgers. You have to give kind of a sexy title to it. So we called it. We called it the soldier athlete initiative. If you're going to perform on the battlefield, you've got to train Like A Champion. And what we did was we completely change, which is a three-legged stool. We completely change the way. We were training to compensate for things that were not going on in grade school and high school. We assigned physical therapists, and athletic trainers to, every organization because we wanted to prevent the injuries and treat them.  Where they turned into those hundred thousand dollar bones, stress fractures. We wanted to fix humble as they became visible. And then the third thing and probably the most important was we change the way we food, feed food in the mess Halls, the dining facilities. We called it, fueling the soldier. You can't, you can't just say, hey have a salad. We instead say  You got to advertise with Soldier. So we said, hey, we're going to fuel you for maximum performance. This is what sport team. This is, this is what sports teams are doing. This is what NFL Major League Baseball, they know they've got to eat right in order to perform perform at their maximum. Okay, I'm not going to dwell. We saw some it within the first year. We saw some unbelievably strong statistics that shows this was working reduction in injuries. We saved about 30 million dollars. The first year just in treatment of injuries.  Thirty million in the Army. Okay, just on injury prevention and we began to see weight loss and improved. We reduced, the number of overweight soldiers. We had our army. We still have a way to go. We've Advanced this fueling, the soldier to fueling the teams. And in fact, we've redirected to the Department of Defense schools for our young people and we're calling it, fueling the future.  What's interest? So we fixed it are we're on the way to fix it. But what's interesting about this is your army.\",\n",
       " '0JF2Gbv1XQ': \"All right. So today we are here with Megan. Megan's been living with type 1, diabetes. Since 2008 and joined our coaching program in February of 2016. She's got an amazing story to tell you and I will let her explain everything. So thanks for being with us here today. Megan. Thanks for having me.  Awesome. So Megan, mate, why don't you start by educating our listeners hear about why you decided to change your nutrition towards low-fat plant-based nutrition living with type 1, diabetes. What was the problem? The problem was that, I was already eating a plant-based diet. I've been eating vegetarian, since I was 10 and then vegan for a couple years before, I joined this program, but I was eating super low carb vegan foods. And so I was relying heavily on nuts and beans and I thought it was super healthy, but still could not.  My blood sugar's at all. I had no control over what was happening. Exercise is super hard because it would either Spike me or drop me and I was just kind of frustrated with not having that control. And so I joined the group to see what I could do to eat more of the things that I loved and have more energy and more control. Give us an idea of your sort of average blood glucose control on a daily basis. Was it in the you know, mid 100's, the 200s and 300s. What are we looking? Like come into hundreds as an average, but with like crazy lows and crazy highs. I was never in the mid-range.  JH got it. And can you maybe tell us, what were you actually eating? At that time? I was eating a lot of nuts. Actually, ate a ton of vegetables. But I was eating really high fat like dressings with them with oils in them. And I a lot of beans and like process like corn tortillas and things that are still vegan, but are super processed. And the reason you were doing that was because you were actually trying to limit your carbohydrate intake so that you could limit your insulin use. Yes, that's correct. Do you want of our best students like you were at every single call you?  Not in this one. And I, we tell people every joins our program, like, you put in the work, you will get the results. You started doing it. What happened? When you started following the program, like immediately so much more energy. First of all, and my insulin needs declined immediately, like, first five days. It was insane. How much my insulin usage went down. And how many carbs I could eat for a unit of insulin. I haven't had a single bladder infection in a year and that's never happened. Since I was born because of A congenital defect I had when I was born.  And you're saying, like, you were just, you love the overall benefits, which is something we preach about a lot, which is our program is about more than just diabetes numbers and you've experienced that. Yeah, for sure. My energy levels are crazy. High, like I don't even have to drink coffee to feel like I have energy all day. It's insane. The benefits are more than just the numbers. It's everything. So at the beginning of the program you were eating I think approximately 75 grams of carbohydrate per day and then when you started doing the program, how many grams of carbohydrate were you?  You get that point around, 250. And did you make that change quickly or did you kind of wrap it up slowly until you got to 250 really quickly? Because like when I cut out the nuts and stuff, I was super hungry. I was moving a lot more carbon than I was used to see your carbohydrate intake went from about 75 grams per day. All the way up to 250 what happened to your insulin use. It went way down. My basal insulin went down really, really quickly. That was the one I first noticed and then with a little added exercise on top of what I normally do. I noticed my bolus insulin.  And decrease really quickly. We say this all the time, people really believe it but you can eat more carbs and take less total in. So that's exactly what happened for you. And I know you always took, you know, beautiful pictures of the meals you eat. So like what actual Foods were you eating a ton of bananas? Big green smoothies? I'm a busy mom. And so I find green smoothies the fastest way to get my Greens in because I don't have the time to sit down and chew through. Like three pounds of lettuce. This is like date. Mango banana combos, a lot of mexican-inspired stuff.  Like Let It romaine lettuce tacos with homemade salsa. Lots of lots of good foods that I've been avoiding for years trying not to eat carbs. Were you surprised by what happened to your insulin? Use? Like honestly would not have believed it. If somebody just told me I had to experience it to believe that it was true. I was glad to hear you say that because that happened to me, that happened to Robbie, and it's happened to so many people living with both type 1, type 2 diabetes, but especially those who are injecting insulin because your expectation is that your insulin use will go up.  But then it falls and it falls fast. And at that point, you're like, whoa. Whoa. Whoa, I need to back off before I go hypoglycemic with limited like energy input like you don't have to do much. You just change what you eat and it's insane how quickly it happens. So tell us what happened to your your A1C value started out at an eight point one. Yeah. And as of three weeks ago, is a 6, point 3, which is the lowest it's been since I was diagnosed. Unbelievable. Okay. So what we did is we ran all of the numbers here to calculate your change in 24 hour.  As activity. So your 24-hour insulin sensitivity is defined as the total number of grams of carbohydrate. You're eating per day divided by the total number of units of insulin, you're injecting which include both your bolus and your basal insulin together. So at the beginning of this program, you are eating about 75 grams of carbohydrate for about 40 units of insulin. So your insulin sensitivity was approximately a two and now that you're eating about 300 grams of carbohydrate per day and your insulin use has fallen to 29%.  86 units per day. Total your insulin sensitivity is now an 11.5 on a 24-hour basis, which means over the course of your program. Your insulin sensitivity has increased by four hundred and eighty-five percent which is basically a almost fivefold increase in your insulin sensitivity. So if you haven't done, so already pat yourself on the back because that's a massive change. And it's something that like you said, you wouldn't have believed it until you actually experience felt it.  So, thank you guys so much. What would you say to somebody, who's considering making this lifestyle change? What would you attempt advice? Would you give them? I would say just try it for a month because you seriously won't go back. Just give it all you have for a month and don't have and how about it just like commit to doing it for a month and you won't go back. That's a good guarantee. Really? Appreciate you sharing your story to inspire others of what's possible. What happens when you follow the program? Thank you guys for all your help.\",\n",
       " '0nVO_DOmVA': \"Role as information governance data protection, privacy Professionals in that future. Now, as I've spoken around the world, many many times on privacy and data protection. I've found that it is as we all know, an incredibly complex and difficult topic. So I've learned a couple of Tricks along the way that story's help and that pretty pictures actually speak much better than my words ever can. So, what I want to do today is share with you.  You look back at the history of privacy. And also look forward at the future of privacy, through the story of three apples. I also want to do all of those stories by sharing with you, some art, some images that I think are evocative of many, of the ideas of privacy that I want to share with you. So you with me three apples delivered through images and art. That will tell us the history of privacy. Give us a sense of the future.  Sure, and in that I will share with you just how Central Your Role is to the rise of the digital economy and how important all of us are in this profession. This new field to a safe and secure future. Let's begin. So, the first Apple is the first Apple. It's the apple of Adam and Eve. Now. We know the story. Well, right Eve was tempted by the serpent to taste of the fruit of the Forbidden tree. She did she shared.  Did it with Adam and upon violating that law, Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden. Now, what's notable about the story and why this is the first Apple is because in that moment, that is when Adam and Eve understand their nakedness and they try to cover their nakedness. They felt a sense of vulnerability and wanted to cover that vulnerability. And so there we have the idea of privacy privacy at One Core.  The idea that we need to protect our vulnerabilities, in fact, if you go to the British museum in London, you can see this same idea. This is Leigh Leigh's. Venus. It's one of the better known pieces at the British Museum and it's one of the first times in art history that both the viewer of the piece and the art are brought together. How are we brought together? Well, Venus is bathing back. In ancient times, baths did not occur inside a home. They were outside and we have interrupted her back.  Bath. We are violating her privacy, like Adam and Eve before Venus feels vulnerable. And so, Venus is trying to protect herself and cover her nakedness that sense of vulnerability is a fundamental human truth. We as humans for time immemorial have sought to protect our vulnerabilities in those moments, when we felt at risk, so certainly think of sleeping in sexual activity. When you are sick all of those  Things are moments that every society on Earth has sought seclusion for because they create vulnerabilities for us. Privacy are the fundamental standards that we wrap around those vulnerabilities to give protection and dignity to those moments. Now, what's interesting is when Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden, they not only covered their nakedness, but they felt something else for the first time and for any of you who were art history, art history.  Majors in University. You'll remember in the Sistine Chapel Michelangelo, painted, Adam, and Eve being expelled from the Garden of Eden. It's in the third day of the Sistine Chapel. And what are they covering? Actually not their nakedness, but their faces they're covering their shame. You see, our vulnerabilities have not only physical constructs, but emotional, and intellectual constructs as well, privacy helps to protect that area of space inside.  Had our lives where we can be eccentric. We can have different thoughts, private moments seclusion for repose and collecting ourselves privacy. Very much has an emotional component, as well.  So there's the beginning. Privacy is a fundamental human truth. It is very much related to our Humanity, but it also changes.  Privacy changes all the time privacy changes because our lives change. Now, this is Vermeer and it's woman in a Blue Dress, reading a letter. She's fully clothed. She doesn't seem embarrassed. But we all know by looking at this that it is a very private moment. Why is it private? Well, we don't quite know. We don't know what she's reading, and maybe a letter from a lover. It may be from a family member. It may be information about something good or bad.  Don't know, but we do know that it's a private moment. Why? Because, in human societies, we need to stitch ourselves together by sharing information. But in order to create those relationships that Stitch us together, we need privacy. We need the space for intimacy, the space for private communication. And with the Advent of the written word, with paper and Pen, we actually were able to document  Those intimacy's in a form that no longer was ephemeral. And so, the written word. Well, this is much later than the Advent of the written word, the Advent of the written word, gave rise to some of our first privacy enhancing Technologies. Not soon after the written word was developed. We saw ciphers and seals and trusted Messengers arise. Why because privacy needed to be protected in those.  Occasions. So, in this way, privacy is a normative value. It responds to the technology of the day. Privacy changes in the context of emerging Technologies, whether it is the written word, the printing press privacy has changed many times over history. Now. I told you that I'm something of a fan of Manchester history and I am just astonished the more I dig into the history of Manchester. How  How many things? How many massive societal changes found their Roots? Here. The first gear that first turned at the beginning of the industrial revolution occurred here in Manchester. I had the chance to go to the Museum of Science and Industry yesterday and I spent a very happy hour and a half wandering, amongst all of those steam engines and textile mills looking at the start of the Industrial Revolution, some 250 years ago.  Now, it's fascinating to me to think back to that moment and compare it to Our Moment now.  In that era here in Manchester, they could not have foretold all of the changes that the Industrial Revolution would bring truly our ideas of public education. Women's suffrage, the labor movement, ultimately the environmental movement responding to the consequences of the industrial economy. They all emerged from this thing that launched here in Manchester the Industrial Revolution.  So privacy responds to changes in technology. The Industrial Revolution was a massive change in technology, didn't create many changes in terms of privacy, but it did change the way we live our lives and how societies respond. Let me tell you a story about this, man. Louis Brandeis and the technology that changed privacy though, and I guess it does relate a bit to the Industrial Revolution in.  ND, Louis Brandeis was an academic at Harvard University and he had just finished his law studies. He had started his practice of Law and he was a member of the upper classes in Boston. At that time. He and law school classmate of his Warren were greatly aggrieved by a new technology that they felt greatly violated their privacy. The Story Goes that this new technology.  Created a new violation, a new sense of invasion and intrusion and they were so aggrieved. In fact that Warren and Brandeis wrote. What is one of the more famous law review articles in all of jurisprudence, the right to privacy and what did they argue? They argued that law and public policy must change to respond to emerging technologies that create new challenges for our understanding of privacy.  They basically said that our expectations of privacy need to keep up with the constant drumbeat of technological innovation. What was the technology that so greatly? Aggrieved them? Well, it seems archaic. It's almost dead. Now. It was flexible film. It was flexible. Film. You see an 1890? Eastman? Kodak had developed flexible film. So no longer did a photographer. Have to set up a big tripod and take a glass plate with a cape over his head, too.  Take a picture know, they could carry around a little brown box surreptitiously and take pictures of people and this was seen as a great violation of privacy.  So, technology challenges privacy, it changes the terms of the game.  Let's now talk about another Revolution that amazingly started here in Manchester as well. Many of you will know this man. Alan Turing, you should all know this man. Alan, Turing, Alan Turing, famously. The British mathematician scientist thinker, who is recognized, as the founding father of computer science.

       " '32eoUB42rw': \"Every time I drink something with aspartame in and I can't help but worry to myself, if I drinking cancer.  Hey, everyone, Laci Green here for dnews. Artificial sweeteners. Have been a hotbed of scientific debate for decades. There's so much to be said about it. But here is a quick round of a few things. You should know about the most common, artificial sweeteners. Saccharin AKA Sweet'N Low. Was the first artificial sweetener discovered way back in 1879 while scientists were formulating chemical, dyes from coal tar, and no, yeom in the 70s studies came out finding that saccharine cause bladder cancer in rats. And so, the government required a cancer warning on the label. They actually tried to take it off the market, but the diet industry.  Make it big bucks and they were not going to have any of that fast forward to the 90s and studies begin to suggest that the bladder cancer effect is only in rodents not humans. And by 2000 the warning label was removed. However, the Center for Science in the public interest, which is a non-profit. Watchdog group has Sakura Don, their avoid lists. Akron has lost a lot of its popularity because of the controversy the most common artificial sweetener on the market. Today is sucralose AKA Splenda. There's a lot of talk about how splendas on Save and it has been tested. But since its Discovery in 1976,  It's been the subject of over 100 long and short-term animal, and human studies, and except for a couple highly questions studies. No ill effects of been found so long as you aren't eating a tub of sucralose for dinner, the FDA approved it in 1998. And the CSP. I also agrees that it's a safe, non-carcinogenic alternative to Sugar. Lastly is the biggie aspartame. It's found in so many products. These days from drinks to candy. Gum processed foods. Jam aspartame came about in the 60s when scientists were looking for ulcer treatments. It's been widely.  Studied son. I mean, thing you should know. Is that the cancer concerns come mostly from a set of high-profile studies done in Italy, where they fed extremely high amounts of aspartame to rats throughout their lifespan rats, develop blood and breast cancers, as well as kidney tumors, which are extremely rare in the breed of brought used. However, the FDA and the efsa, both rejected, the studies on the rather vague grounds that they lacked important data and approved aspartame. Anyway, as for studies on people, the largest study was done by the National Cancer Institute, examining cancer rates in half a million adults.  Between the groups that did and did not consume products with aspartame. There was no increased risk of cancer for those that did. But the Watchdog group argues that this study was incomplete. It didn't include the very elderly nor people who had consumed aspartame, since childhood aspartame intake was also self-reported, which is a serious flaw. When you consider the fact that a lot of the time people don't know what's in their food, the CSP. I gives aspartame, its lowest food safety ranking in, argues that it's not safe for human consumption and I've read a lot of reports out of concern for my own health and you should too. If you're interested, the bottom line.  Seems to be through Colossus the safest for regular consumption aspartame and saccharine are more questionable. So you're going to consume them. Maybe don't do it too much. Also, if you're using artificial sweeteners to lose weight, there's a strong body of research that suggests. It doesn't help. In fact, across several large studies done at Yale for the National Institute of Health, people who use artificial sweeteners, actually gain weight over time. They're still trying to figure out why this happens. Scientists are also just now starting to study a new artificial sweetener, touted as a natural alternative to Sugar called Stevia or  Truvia with the limited studies that are out there. It looks like it could be safe and the CSP I statements seem more positive about the potential for Stevia. Oh man, lots of facts today. I hope this was useful to some of you out there. I'm gonna put lots of further reading in the description. Check it out. And let me know what you think about. Artificial sweeteners, on RD news Facebook page. Thanks for joining me.

       " '9wPrmfQ0vw': \"One of the most common complaint in adrenal fatigue and symptoms of adrenal fatigue, is the need to have food in order to avoid fatigue anxiety, brain, fog soon. After a meal is taken. This is dr. LAM founder of drlam.com in this video. We will go through the mechanics of what actually happens in this form of hypoglycemia, which we call reactive hypoglycemia. Laboratory tests, if you take a spot blood sample at the time, that Sensations comes on or fatigue brain fog inside. This is usually normal. So sufferers are universally baffled. Doctors are also not sure what is going on and tell the clients or the patience that everything is fine. But is it really fine? Let's take a look. Now, when blood sugar is dropping. Then the term hypoglycemia is used. Usually clinically, we see the laboratory layer value of sugar, less than 60 to 70 mg per deciliter. But in the case of adrenal fatigue, Associated hypoglycemic episodes, the blood sugar actually is normal now, we don't exactly know why this is happening. But we do know is that there's a form of reactive hypoglycemia a form of hypoglycemia does.  Called reactive hypoglycemia should be more clear, is that it's not the absolute level of blood sugar that decides, whether you have symptoms or not. However, it is the job of normal blood sugar has 100 to 120 milligrams per deciliter to the 60, or 70, or even 80. So while you can have a spot sugar of 80 and consider normal, but the drop from 110 to 80 is what  Triggers the hypoglycemic symptoms. This is why it's called reactive hypoglycemia. And when you have this, which is commonly associated with adrenal fatigue, laboratory tests will show normal. Now, what you can do is to eat a bit more frequently and that is the common thing to do. But you also want to not just simply eat, but understand the physiology that this is the way the body is telling you.  That it is metabolically. Deranged underneath. You may not necessarily in a diabetic situation and you're not necessarily having the medical clinical diagnosis of hypoglycemia, but you have hypoglycemic symptoms and laboratory values are normal. Now, take more snacks. It's a good thing to do. Repeat blood test is usually not productive but reactive hypoglycemia is a sign of later stages of  You know, fatigue and usually when that happens to you is a sign that you have to look and see what else is going on. You should is also accompanied by brain fog, irritability and nighttime, it can actually wake you up after you've been sleeping during the daytime after lunch. You may have to find that you need a snack about two hours before afterwards. I'm sorry. Otherwise, you would feel draggy and really fatigued and  MP the same thing that happened in the morning around 10:00 about two to three hours before. I'm sorry after breakfast, but before lunch, you will, then feel a sense that you really need food. And if you don't have that food supply or the sugar Buddhist, then, your body will feel very, very weak. This are the classic signs of reactive hypoglycemia in the situation of adrenal fatigue. Now, it's very important also to check with your doctor to see there.  Other forms of metabolic imbalances. Those people who have a family history of diabetes especially should be a little bit more careful because your body can react in different ways under those situation, but if you really put the picture together clinically in adrenal fatigue, you can sense the big picture and the big picture is what counts is not just the hypoglycemic episode on its own. Sometimes you can have accompanied as I said earlier, brain fall heart, palpitations, pain of unknown.  Origin, insomnia, heart palpitations and arrhythmias joint. Pains, etc. Etc.

I need to go to the doctors. So went and she said, okay. We need to send you for an urgent gastroscopy and even then it didn't occur to me at be anything. Serious at all. We were brought into the doctor's office. Afterwards and he said found something and it's quite serious. I think you've got stomach cancer, which was like, well, I didn't expect that.

Had a chemotherapy called r-chop went in. I had to room to myself. Luckily, nurses come in, tell me what was going to happen. Hook me up to the drugs, by 2:00 3:00. I was free. So I wasn't, I'd have lunch there. It was. Yeah, it was interesting. The first couple as as it went on the heart, you know, we've got harder and harder, the fourth one was horrible, but the  Fifth and sixth one. I just felt awful. They were my worst times. I had a thing on my phone that said, how are you today? And so every day, I would just fill in how I was feeling. You know, I look back last night. I went through all my all my days and actually I feel sorry for myself. I look back on my chemo and think how positive we were and it was a horrible, horrible thing to go through but yeah, it was fine a bit like childbirth. It's almost like you forget it, forget about it afterwards but reading my  Day-to-day diary was.  really sad last night because  I was really sick and, you know, you try and remain positive all the time. And actually, I generally I was but there was a few times, I'd written down the I'd cry, dad sat on the sofa and cried for no reason. But yeah, I got a red face. Dry mouth couldn't taste anything. My taste buds were shot. Paul was great though. We got chemo cookbook. Actually, that was quite interesting to see to cook different things and to you know, see what  Fancied eating because I wasn't didn't fancy some that a lot of the time I had to gastrostomy after my third chemo and they said there was no more cancer in my stomach. But the rest of the cameras were built in prices and then I in the December, I had a pet scan that tells me, I have no cancer and that was huge and I will forever celebrate that. And then we had a lovely Christmas and in fact at school. It was our Night Out. Ooh, end-of-term night hours, and I said well,  If I got my cancer, I'm coming. And if I haven't so I walked in to the party and everybody was like. So they all knew and which is that was a really nice celebration of it as well. But afterwards, you know, they're all the side effects. They stay with you. The inside of my body felt sort of Rusty. It was, it was hard to move things, and that's why I think maybe I should have done more exercise. It made. You did bit bit more walk in my legs.  Kill Ali. And in the February, I went back to work. And actually I shouldn't have gone back to work, but you're feeling better and I was a little bit bored and I think, you know, I enjoy my job. I just face return, but I realized I was still an old woman walking down the corridors, or going, and doing my, not going about my normal job because you know how you feel in an environment. I remember walking down the corridor to one of the classrooms thinking. Yeah, this is  Wrong, I'd. But anyway, I soldiered on and eventually I got better and better. I don't know how many gastroscopy so I've had now and I every time I see the same consultant and it's quite nice. We have a laugh and you know, he said oh you here again, and I love having a gastroscopy is  Yeah, I have to sedation anyway, so it doesn't hurt. It's not a problem. But it means there's nothing in there and I get been there first before everyone at. Now. I just have them once a year. I wanted to be open and talk about it and that would be my advice I suppose.  Talk to other people about it. I had a couple of friends who came around and talk to me about going through it. And, you know, we had a bit of a cry and it is it's a hard thing to go through but it's we were very positive throughout the whole thing and I don't want to paint it as awful awful because you know, I look back in it and I was amazed, it was so awful.  So, you forget about it, and I know I'm now next week.  On the 31st of May, it will be four years since I've been diagnosed. So on Tuesday, it will have been for years. And then in December it will be four years that I'm in remission. So yay, for me.\",\n",

       " 'bxgQS3RPvQ': \"Is intensity the rate of glycogen depletion decreases as we'll see in the lectures on fatigue running out of glycogen during prolonged. Strenuous exercise is often associated with fatigue.  If we think about the factors that regulate glycogen breakdown during exercise, that might explain primarily the exercise intensity effects. We see that there's local control from factors that increase in the muscle notably calcium, which you'll recall from muscle contraction increases in the muscle when the muscle contracts. Also, the increase in inorganic, phosphate that occurs when muscles break down ATP. Is another activator of the enzymes that break down.  Glycogen during exercise.  In terms of hormonal control of muscle, glycogen breakdown, a major regulator is the increase in circulating adrenaline. And as exercise intensity increases and those plasma adrenaline levels increase it binds to receptors on the muscle and through a series of steps activates glycogen breakdown, in muscle the higher, the exercise intensity, the higher, the adrenaline, the greater the muscle glycogen breakdown.  We also know that the availability of glycogen within the muscle increases its own breakdown. So if there are increased stores of glycogen you tend to break them down at a higher rate.  It's been some discussion and debate as to whether increasing the availability of glucose in. The bloodstream has any influence on glycogen breakdown during exercise and to date most of the studies would suggest that it has a fairly modest effect in contrast. If fatty acid levels are increased in the bloodstream, that has been shown to slow the rate of muscle glycogen breakdown, and there has been some interest in nutritional strategies that serve to increase fatty acid, availability with a  You to changing the rate of glycogen breakdown?  And finally, an increase in muscle temperature that you see when you exercise in the heat is associated with a greater rate of glycogen breakdown. So when athletes exercise in a hot environment, they often rely more heavily on their muscle glycogen stores, and that has implications for the nutritional strategies that they need to adopt under those circumstances.  Another important factor, which influences glycogen breakdown during exercise is training status. And an important adaptation to training is an increase in the mitochondrial, oxidative capacity of the muscle, and that's associated with a lower utilization of glycogen, and you can see that both the aerobic.  And the so-called anaerobic utilization of glycogen is reduced after exercise training. And this is a major adaptation, which is thought to contribute to the increased fatigue resistance that you see in well trained subjects during prolonged strenuous exercise.  If we turn our attention to glucose from the bloodstream as a source of energy for Contracting muscle, we see again that both exercise intensity and duration impact on the rate of glucose uptake.  You can see in this graph, the glucose uptake into Contracting leg muscles at three exercise intensities. So as there's an increase in intensity and increase in glucose uptake, and you'll also see that at any given exercise, intensity a progressive increase in glucose uptake.  If the exercise extends for several hours then over time, what one sees is a slow reduction in glucose uptake as the blood glucose levels Decline. And this is one of the reasons why ingesting carbohydrate containing drinks is often used as a strategy by endurance athletes to maintain blood glucose levels and to maintain glucose uptake during prolonged exercise.  In terms of the regulation of glucose uptake into muscle. We need to remember that this process occurs by facilitated diffusion and what that means is that we need a gradient for glucose to move from outside the muscle to inside the muscle and we need a special transport, carrier molecule to help get glucose across the membrane.  There are three main sites of regulation for muscle glucose, uptake.  The supply of glucose.  The transport of glucose across the plasma membrane, by A protein that we know as glued fall and the intra cellular metabolism of glucose.  During exercise with a large increase in muscle blood flow. We see increased glucose delivery to the muscle.  There's activation of the glucose transport process and I'll talk about that in a moment and during exercise, the increase in metabolism through those glycolytic and oxidative Pathways that we've spoken about means that glucose is rapidly metabolized and maintains the gradient for glucose to move into the muscle.  In the post exercise period. A very important process is the recovery of muscle glycogen and the resynthesis of glycogen is the major metabolic fate of glucose that is taken up in the recovery period and ingesting carbohydrate, during recovery is an important way of maximizing the re synthesis of glycogen during recovery.  If we look at the regulation of muscle glucose uptake during exercise, we see that those three processes that I've just mentioned are increased. There's an increase in glucose delivery because of the increase in muscle blood flow. The glute for transport protein, which normally resides inside the muscle cell moves, quickly, to the plasma membrane where it becomes a functioning glucose transporter.  It's been some debate as to, whether the activity of this transport protein can be increased during exercise, and at the moment, at least, there's no evidence that that happens.  And finally, as I said, if you increase the disposal of glucose through the glycolytic and oxidative Pathways, then that will maintain the diffusion gradient into the Contracting skeletal muscle.  We know that the availability of other substrates will influence, glucose uptake. If glycogen levels are high in the muscle, then we tend to see a lower rate of glucose uptake.  The availability of glucose in. The bloodstream is very important because it it sets the arterial glucose concentration for that, diffusion gradient. So if glucose levels are low during prolonged exercise in the absence of glucose ingestion, you'll sent you'll tend to see a decrease in glucose uptake. And if you increase the blood glucose level by ingesting, a carbohydrate drink and absorbing the glucose from the gut, you'll see an increase in glucose uptake.  The effects of free fatty acids on glucose uptake or a little less clear compared with those on muscle glycogen. With some studies suggesting that increased fatty acid availability will slow glucose uptake.  Other Studies have seen, no effect.  An important point to make in relation to glucose uptake during exercise, is that it occurs independent of insulin, the processes that are involved in glucose, uptake during muscle contractions are slightly different from those involved, with insulin stimulation.  And it's, for this reason that there's a lot of interest in exercise as a way of improving glucose uptake in those diseases, like diabetes, where insulin doesn't work as well.  Another important consideration is if you are a type 1 diabetic and you have to inject yourself with insulin, if that occurs in close, proximity to exercise because the two stimuli are additive that can often increase the risk of premature hypoglycemia, and that's why exercising type 1 diabetics. Often take lollies with them to rapidly increase their blood glucose level if they feel that their blood glucose levels,  Are going low or if they feel what's called hypo.  And finally, the adrenaline circulating adrenaline, which increases with increasing exercise intensity. It's well described effects. On muscle glycogen the effects on glucose, uptake are less clear.  Given that the translocation of glute for from inside the muscle cell to the sarcolemma is very important. In removing. The plasma membrane is a barrier for glucose, uptake has been a lot of interest in the molecular regulation of this glute for transport process. And you can see in this slide a number of molecules and enzymes that have been implicated in this glut4. Translocation process.  Most attention has focused on two pretty fundamental changes in muscle. We spoke about those in the adaptations lecture and that is the increase in calcium, and the change in energy status, which has an impact on a kinase, the A&P activated protein, kinase. So again, local events in the muscle changes in calcium and changes in the energy levels within the muscle serve to  Stimulate glut4. Translocation to facilitate glucose uptake into Contracting muscle during exercise.  Just as we saw, with muscle glycogen utilization after training. We also see a reduction in the Reliance on glucose. This study was done. Using labeled isotopes of glucose, which enable you to measure glucose uptake. And also the appearance of the carbon label in the expired breath. So you can measure oxidation and you can see that both glucose uptake and glucose oxidation are reduced after endurance training.  Now, it's very important that the blood glucose concentration, be maintained within relatively normal range during exercise. And this is the role of the liver during exercise. And so just\",\n",

However, the acute complications of diabetes mellitus are often the most serious and can be potentially even life-threatening. Let's discuss one of the acute complications of diabetes known as diabetic ketoacidosis or dka for shark, which can occur in individuals with type 1 diabetes. Now recall, that type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease.  As order. And as such, there's an autoimmune destruction of the beta cells in the pancreas, which prevents the pancreas from producing and secreting insulin. Therefore there is an absolute insulin deficiency in type 1 diabetes. But what exactly does this mean for the body to get a better understanding? Let's think about insulin requirements as a balancing act with energy needs. Now, the goal here is to keep the balance in balance as the energy requirements of the body. Go up, insulin is needed to take the glucose out of the  Blood and store it throughout the body. Normally an individual's, without type 1, diabetes. The pancreas is able to produce enough insulin to keep up with any amount of energy requirement. But how does this change of someone has Type 1 diabetes? Well, since their pancreas cannot produce as much insulin, they have an absolute insulin deficiency. Now, for day-to-day activities, this may not actually cause any problems because the small amount of insulin that is produced is able to compensate and keep the balance in Balance. However, over time.  Has Type 1, diabetes, worsens and less insulin is able to be produced then the balance becomes slightly unequal and this results in the Subacute or mild symptoms of type 1 diabetes such as fatigue because the body isn't able to match these energy requirements. But what happens if the body is placed in a state of stress such as with an infection. Now, these stress situations require a tremendous amount of energy and the balance ends up getting tipped to a point where the body is far from being.  Able to compensate and this is the situation in which diabetic ketoacidosis occurs. And when this happens metabolically speaking, the body goes into a starvation State. Now. This is not necessarily a true state of starvation because someone with type 1, diabetes is still able to eat and bring in nutrients. However, without an adequate amount of insulin, the body is not able to utilize these nutrients for energy. And in this sense type 1 diabetes can be thought of as a starvation in the face of  T as glucose is present. In fact, it's present in it in excess in the blood. However, the body is not able to utilize it for energy. So the body reacts, as if it is starving, which in some senses, it is. So how does this starvation metabolism than result in diabetic ketoacidosis. Well, first, let's start with the goal of starvation metabolism. And that is to preserve energy for crucial life, sustaining organs and the most important of which is the brain  And one thing you need to know about the brain is that when it comes to energy, the brain is very picky. The brain, can't utilize many forms of energy. In fact, there are only two forms of energy, the brain can use and these are glucose and ketones. And if it has to choose between the two, it prefers glucose. So the goal of starvation metabolism is to convert other forms of nutrients, such as fat protein and glycogen into glucose and ketones. Now, in order to understand the clinical presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis,  No acidosis, we need to discuss a few metabolic pathways that occur throughout the body. So I like to think of metabolism as being similar to a pawn shop at a pawn shop. The goal is to convert different items of value, such as precious stones, or gold into a usable form of currency in the form of cash. Now, in metabolism, there are many different forms of energy, such as proteins in muscle and the triglycerides are lipids, that are in adipose tissue. However, as I just  And they're not usable by the brain. So they need to be converted into usable forms of energy, such as glucose and ketones. And this most commonly occurs within the liver, which can be thought of as the metabolic pawnshop. And there are a few important Pathways for the conversion of these energy sources into glucose and ketones. And these pathways are driven by the interaction between many different hormones. Now, fortunately, the names of all, these Pathways will help. Give us an idea of what they do. So, we'll  Start with proteolysis which occurs within muscle cells. If we look at the name, lysis stands for the breakdown and produce stands for protein. So, proteolysis is the breakdown of proteins. And in this process proteins are broken down into amino acids, which are then carried through the bloodstream to the liver where they take part in gluconeogenesis, which we'll discuss in just a minute here. And similarly, lipolysis occurs in adipose or fat tissue.  Lipo stands for lipids, which are another term for fats. And once again, Lysa stands for the breakdown of. And in this process, the triglycerides that are within lipids, are broken down into their component parts, which are glycerol and free fatty acids, and they are then carried to through the bloodstream to the liver to take part in gluconeogenesis, and it's important to note that this process also produces some inflammatory cytokines, which will become important in just a little bit here.  Now, let's move on to gluconeogenesis. If we look at the name, neo genesis stands for the creation of and glucose resent represents glucose. So, gluconeogenesis is the creation of glucose, which, as you recall, is one of the primary goals of starvation metabolism. So, how does this work? Well, the amino acids from proteolysis in the muscle cells and the glycerol and free fatty acids from the lipolysis in the adipose, tissue undergo a series of metabolic reactions within the liver.  That produce glucose. But this process is not perfect. And in order to create glucose from free fatty acids and glycerol, a byproduct known as acetyl, Co a is produced, and then utilized later in the ketogenesis pathway. So, we mentioned that the purpose of starvation metabolism is to produce glucose and ketones. So the ketogenesis is where ketones come in here, and it's the metabolic pathway for the creation of or the Genesis of ketones.  And it utilizes the acetyl COA from gluconeogenesis, which then undergoes a series of reactions to produce ketones. Then the last Pathway to mention. Is that of glycogen a lysis, which is the lysis or breakdown of glycogen. So, glycogen is a storage form of glucose. And essentially, all it is, is a polymer of many different glucose molecules or a chain of glucose molecules, that are linked to one another, and in glycogenolysis glycogen is broken down into  Was, which is once again, one of the primary goals of starvation metabolism. Now, as you can see, there's a lot going on here, but by understanding this, these metabolic pathways, we can gain a clearer understanding of the clinical presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis. So what is this clinical presentation? First off someone in dka is very sick and likely became sick over a fairly short period of time maybe just a few hours to days and they most commonly complain of abdominal.  Domino, pain, nausea and vomiting. In addition, they are severely dehydrated and therefore their skin may appear cool and clammy. Then lastly and most alarming, many individuals in diabetic ketoacidosis will have an altered mental status. Meaning they may be confused or even unconscious. So why do all of these symptoms occur? So nausea vomiting and abdominal pain are pretty nonspecific symptoms, but they are very common in diabetic ketoacidosis and  Symptoms occur because of these inflammatory cytokines that are released from lipolysis and other metabolic processes and then these cytokines irritate the gastrointestinal tract resulting in these symptoms. Now, unfortunately the loss of fluid from vomiting leads to the next clinical symptom which is dehydration. However, the dehydration that occurs in diabetic ketoacidosis is extremely severe and much more severe than what's caused by the vomiting alone, but why  Exactly. Is this? Well. We discussed earlier that the goal of starvation metabolism is to produce glucose. So what's the problem here? Well, remember, the patient has diabetes. And if there's a deficiency of insulin, then the body is not able to pull all of this glucose out of the blood to either store it or utilize it for energy. So the body is acting like it's starving and it's continues to produce all this glucose despite its not being able to use it and the glucose then builds up and builds up in the blood.  Saltine in hyperglycemia or high blood sugar levels. Now, when the kidneys are filtering blood, they are normally able to reabsorb all of the glucose in the blood. However, at a certain point of hyperglycemia, the amount of glucose in the blood exceeds the kidneys ability to reabsorb it and glucose begins to spill out into the urine. And this is a process called glucose area. And glucose is in osmotically active, solute in the urine. This means that glucose sucks. The water  Water that's in the blood stream out into the urine with it. And this is known as osmotic diuresis or the loss of water due to an osmotic, Lee active solute. And it's this osmotic, diuresis that causes the severe fluid loss in dehydration in diabetic, ketoacidosis, that can lead to an altered mental status. Now, once again, it's not just the dehydration. That causes the altered mental status in diabetic, ketoacidosis. It is made worse because of the consequences of ketogenesis.  So ketones or Ketone bodies are an important source of energy for the brain and Heart during times of starvation. However, they come at a trade-off and that is that Ketone bodies are acids. So they lower the pH of the blood, a process known as acidosis, and the body is able to buffer, this effect to an extent. However, in dka, the ketones are produced in. Such large quantities. That it overcomes the buffering ability of the body and results in acidosis. And since it's due to a metabolic  Process. It is known as a metabolic acidosis and metabolic acidosis worsens, altered, mental status. And also if it's severe enough, it may even cause cardiac arrhythmias or abnormal heart rhythms, that can be fatal. So you can see here that the clinical presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis is directly tied to the underlying metabolism that's caused by the starvation state or perhaps as we said earlier better, put the starvation and the face of  Any that occurs in type 1, diabetes. And anytime someone with type 1, diabetes presents with abdominal pain, altered, mental status, and signs of dehydration dka or diabetic, ketoacidosis should be very high in the differential for the cause of their illness. And they will need to be treated quickly, and aggressively with intravenous fluids and Insulin, because if it's left, untreated diabetic, ketoacidosis can be fatal.\",\n",

Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that allows your body to use sugar from carbohydrates in the food that you eat for energy or to store glucose for future. Use insulin helps keep your blood sugar levels from getting too high, a condition known as hyperglycemia or too low, a condition known as hypoglycemia.  The cells in your body need sugar for energy. After you eat food and your blood sugar level rises cells in your pancreas known as the beta cells are signal to release insulin into your bloodstream. However, sugar cannot go into most of your cells directly insulin, then attaches to and signals cells to absorb sugar. From the bloodstream insulin is often described as a key which unlocks  This cell to allow sugar to enter the cell and be used for energy.  NPH insulin also known as isil.

Normally the production of glucose is regulated by genetic switches. One of which that we've been interested in is called crtc to what makes this relay System worth studying. We think, is that the activity of the ip3 receptor, spigot and the calcineurin accelerator at both increased in diabetic animals.  And if we reduce the activities of the, the spigot and the accelerator, we can shut down the production of glucose and make these animals more. What we would say, have normal blood glucose levels.

See a basal insulin at night or D metformin. And in previous years you could make an argument, you know, so which one might be better. Now, it's fairly clear and  The American Diabetes Association recommends along with the American Association of clinical Endocrinology just metformin is a foundational drug for diabetes. So we'll talk about different interventions for diabetes with medicines in a second. But you always start with lifestyle first because just think about it, a multidisciplinary team can promote weight loss of up to nine percent among patients with diabetes and that's going to reduce the need to use anti diabetes, drugs, and Ein our effort.  Tons of drugs as well. Physical activity is about as good as a one of the weaker oral agents for reducing hba1c and diet advice is similar, can reduce the hba1c by another half to one percent for most people and it probably is better when it comes from somebody with experience in counseling, patients, like a dietitian or a service fee. Certified diabetes educator versus physician who's trying to manage 20 things at once.  Look, a little Pearl regarding home glucose testing. We recommend this broadly and probably a little too broadly, just in terms of stewardship, of resources because it can get expensive to get new machines to get the lancets, to get the test strips. It's most helpful for patients with severe diabetes, who are taking insulin. It hasn't really been shown to make much of a difference among patients who are fairly well controlled on oral medications, especially those  Early in their illness and it doesn't necessarily change quality of life where I might use it in a patient, who's on oral medications alone is pay, our patients with highly fluctuating glucose, going very high and then, at risk of hypoglycemia, but for somebody who's chugging along and taking only metformin and their hba1c is 6.8 26.6 percent. Every time I check it, you know, there's not really much of a need to do any any home glucose testing at all. So,  the thing about,  Now I mentioned metformin is the first line agent, why there's a low risk of hypoglycemia hypoglycemia, and it's dangerous. Become a lot more apparent over the past few years and we'll talk about some agents that promote low sugar. It's usually associated with a very modest weight loss. It doesn't create the cycle of more weight gain, therefore more, insulin resistance and then more need for drugs. And the big complication with metformin that everybody worries about is,  Lactic acidosis. That's right. And it's more common among patients with severe kidney disease, but now the new rules and warnings on the drug state that it can be used for certain patients all the way down to a Camaro filtration rate of 30 millimeters per minute. So that's kind of remarkable in it and a big change. Getting metformin, two more patients. Who need it? So far. We have been around a long time. Like metformin. They're inexpensive.  And like mint form and they promote about the same degree of hba1c reduction. If you ever get stopped and have to answer in like half a second. Okay? How much does this drug reduce? This oral drug reduce hba1c 1% is always a good answer because they tend to be around that level. But the problem is so fiery is is they can promote hypoglycemia and weight gain and therefore may be less favored. There's also an unknown affect, whether they improve mortality or not new.  Agents now, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 Inhibitors. These are I think the benefit to these drugs. Is there really well? Tolerated. They're fairly easy to use, don't promote a lot hypoglycemia low rate of side effects. Overall. They can even be used in moderate renal dysfunction as well. The drawback they're not that effective. So they're good for patients who are right next to goal, maybe with metformin, but can't quite get there. But they also have intolerance to multiple drugs, you know, a dpp-4 inhibitor, could be a  A good idea for them. The as Aladin Dion's olds, you only rosiglitazone. His own is available in the United States. These drugs can promote weight gain, which is partly water weight. They can promote a Dima patients with a history of bladder. Cancer osteoporosis should not be using these drugs and they reduce hba1c by about 1%. So they still have some role, but it's probably a more limited secondary role in the management of most cases of type 2 diabetes.  What about the glucagon-like peptide? 1 receptor Agonist? So these are different drugs. These are again even a newer wave. They've been out for several years now. So it's important for us to know them different dosing schedules, but they are not there's no oral product out there right now. There are subcutaneous, injections. They rarely are associated with pancreatitis and you can't use them on patients with the most severe. Chronic kidney disease, but they can be used in moderate kidney disease.  The Beneficial effects of glp-1 agonists. They can promote weight loss. Sometimes it exceeds six or seven kilograms. It routinely it's going to be at least 4 kg. So weight loss is MM important. Something that patients can really hold onto, it's not easy to lose 4, kg of body weight for many patients. And their hba1c action is a little bit stronger than other oral agents. So between the fact that it promotes weight loss and it reduces Ava a ones  Fairly robustly. I like glp-1 agonists.  Another new kid on the Block, the sodium-glucose cotransport or two or sglt2 Inhibitors. These inhibit glucose reuptake, they work in the kidneys. They have been associated with a higher risk for UTI, as well as genital fungal infections. These also promote weight loss, though, as well as they lower blood pressure and of themselves to again a little bit weaker though, for their hba1c reduction. So not not something, not that strong reduction, you might experience with.  Glp-1 agonists.\",\n",
       " 'uGJHbAIbE': \"Thank you, Teresa and thanks to everyone of you. And for the organizer to organize. This is a fantastic thing. I actually found out this morning that today in Europe. They're having a stem cell day is called Unit stem. It's sponsored by Unisom. So I think it's quite a coincidence and I think it's nice that we're engaging with the public and University throughout the world. Discussed is, of course, I'm a simple biology. So I'm going to argue for the stem cell use of Seltzer pancreatic cells. Derived from the embryonic stem cells, are pluripotent stem cells to treat, type 1, diabetes. And as you heard from Derek before in the introduction, the current treatment of for type 1. Diabetes insulin injection, either by needles or with pumps, which you will hear in the second debate, but this treatment is not  Not very efficient because we cannot control in real time. The sugar concentration in your blood, in the blood, and this is the job of the beta cells. The beta cells in your pancreas, is constantly monitoring the sugar level in your blood and constantly adjusting. So if there is too much sugar, the beta cells, releases insulin insulin is like a message. Goes to the other organs, and say there is too much sugar in your blood, take it up.  So if we can substitute this beta cells that is destroyed in type 1 diabetics patients, then we can cure the disease and we know we can do this because transplantation of the entire pancreas or the eyelids as you heard before which are isolated from the pancreas works, but it doesn't work for a long time. As you heard after five years. Usually, a patient needs to have another transplant of eyelids unless they  Receive the whole pancreas, which is usually more successful, but the problem with that, there's two problems with that. The first problem is immunosuppressants immunosuppressants are very harsh drugs, you know, you don't want to give with two patients with type 1. Diabetes is actually better to be on insulin treatment rather than having immunosuppressants. So only patient, there are really sick and cannot control their blood glucose with insulin. Injection will be candidate for all pancreas.  Sensational or islet transplantation. The second biggest problem that we have with the transplantation is that we don't have enough donors. Even if you want to, you know, if you want to cure, even if everybody in the world decides to become a donor after their death, we will not have enough patience. We would not even have enough donors to cure every patient with type 1 diabetes. So, how are we going to address this? We're going to generate  Eight cells from pluripotent stem cells and that will allow us to generate an unlimited source of beta cells that can cure type 1 diabetes. And we know we can do this. And when I say this is because this is not the future, this is happening. Now. It's not science fiction. We can actually do this every day. I do it in the lab, not this Tower here, but on the other side of Mars and if, you know, if you ever become interested in science, and you want to comment  When summer student in my lab and maybe graduate students, I'm here. Now promoting my love, you can come, and I'll teach you how to do this. We take an embryonic stem cells or an IPS cells, which is as dr. Aurelia pitching in, showed you before itself from you. Any one of you here that I can revert to become embryonic stem cell like and we can convert it into a pancreatic cells. And as of last year, two groups one in Canada, and one in the u.s. Show that  We can actually make beta cells in vitro and we've been able to reproduce that. So, what we're doing now is taking this cells either a cell that can become a pancreatic project can become a beta cells or in the future. I beta cell itself and we can transplant it into patients with type 1, diabetes, to cure the disease. And again, this is not the future. This is already happening. There is a clinical trial undergoing.  Right now in the states, treating patient with this type of cells treating patients with type 1, diabetes with this type of cells and very soon. I expect that Canada will launch the same clinical trial, the FDA approved, the trial in the US and health Canada, as a proved at trial in Canada. It hasn't started yet, but I think he's going to start very soon. So you can see how this is not a question of  Of how? And whether we're going to do this, we're going to do it. And we just going to get better at this and the best, you know, the best side of this is that we were going to put these cells inside the device. Imagine this device to be like a tea bag where you going to have the cells inside the tea bag, they're protected from the immune system that would normally attack the cells, but they can sense the sugar coming through the, to the pores of the membrane and can  Is insulin into the bloodstream. So if even if something goes wrong in the process of preparation that we put into a patient, we can figure it out and remove the tea bag from the patient. So, you know, when I heard from Terry so that my opponent was there, a gander Koya was a bit scared because he's the hardest person to debate against. But as you can see, this argument is pretty strong. So I'm actually looking forward to hear what he can come.  Come up with and you know, please stay on my side. Thank you very much. I'll take questions after their ex talk.\",\n",

This may occur after an injury or infection or in people suffering from any chronic health, problem affecting, blood circulation, the primary cause of gangrene is reduced blood supply to the affected tissues, which results in cell death, diabetes, and long-term smoking increase the risk of suffering from gangrene.  There are different types of gangrene with different symptoms. Such as dry gangrene wet gangrene gas. Gangrene internal gangrene and necrotizing. Fasciitis. Treatment options include debridement, or in severe cases. Amputation of the affected body parts antibiotics, vascular, surgery, maggot therapy or hyperbaric, oxygen therapy.  Causes gangrene is caused by ischemia or infection such as by the bacteria, clostridium, perfringens or by thrombosis a blood vessel blocked by a blood clot. It is usually the result of critically insufficient blood. Supply, for example, peripheral vascular disease and is often associated with diabetes and long term. Tobacco smoking. This condition is most common in the lower extremities the best treatment for gangrene.  Is revascularization, that is restoration of blood flow of The Afflicted organ, which can reverse some of the effects of necrosis and allow healing. Other treatments include debridement and surgical amputation. The method of treatment is generally determined by the location of affected tissue and extent of tissue loss. Gangrene may appear as one effect of foot binding.  Types.  Dry.  Dry gangrene begins at the distal part of the limb due to ischemia and often occurs in the toes and feet of elderly patients, due to arteriosclerosis. And thus is also known as senile gangrene dry. Gangrene is mainly due to arterial occlusion. There is limited, putrefaction, and bacteria, fail to survive dry gangrene spreads slowly through portions of tissue where the blood supply is inadequate. To keep tissue viable. The affected part is dry shrunken. And  Dark reddish black, resembling mummified flesh. The dark coloration is due to liberation of hemoglobin from hemolyzed.

If it is not removed surgically also called Auto  Ocean dry gangrene is actually a form of coagulative necrosis. If blood flow is interrupted for a reason other than severe bacterial infection. The result is a case of dry, gangrene individuals with impaired, peripheral blood flow, such as diabetics are at greater risk of developing dry. Gangrene the early signs and symptoms of dry. Gangrene are a dull, ache and sensation of coldness in the affected area along with pallor of the flesh. If  Literally, the process can, sometimes be reversed by vascular surgery. However, if necrosis sets in the affected tissue must be removed, Justice with wet gangrene wet. Wet gangrene occurs. In naturally, moist tissue and organs such as the mouth bowel lungs, cervix and vulva, bedsores occurring on body parts such as the sacrum buttocks and heels, although not necessarily moist air.  Areas are also wet gangrene infections. This condition is characterized by thriving bacteria and has a poor prognosis. Compared to dry gangrene due to septicemia. Resulting from the free communication between infected fluid and circulatory fluid in wet. Gangrene. The tissue is infected by Sapporo genic microorganisms clostridium, perfringens or bacillus fousey formas, for example, which caused his shoe to swell and emit a fetid smell.  Wet gangrene usually develops rapidly due to blockage of Venus, mainly and or arterial blood flow. The affected part is saturated with stagnant blood, which promotes the rapid growth of bacteria. The toxic products formed by bacteria are absorbed causing systemic manifestation of septicemia, and finally death. The affected part is edematous, soft, putrid, rotten and dark. The darkness. In wet gangrene occurs due to the same.  Carnism. As in dry, gangrene wet. Gangrene is coagulative necrosis. Progressing to leak, effective necrosis, gas.  Gas, gangrene is a bacterial infection that produces gas within tissues. It is a deadly form of gangrene usually caused by clostridium. Perfringens bacterial infection spreads rapidly as the gases produced by bacteria, expand and infiltrate healthy tissue in the vicinity because of its ability to quickly spread to surrounding tissues gas, gangrene should be treated as a medical emergency.  Gas gangrene is caused by a bacterial exotoxin producing clostridium species, which are mostly found in soil and other anaerobes. For example, bacteroides and anaerobic. Streptococci these environmental bacteria. May enter the muscle through a wound and subsequently proliferate in necrotic tissue and secrete. Powerful toxins. These toxins destroy nearby tissue generating gas at the same time, a gas composition of 5.9%.  Cajun, 3.4 percent. Carbon dioxide 74.5% nitrogen and 16.1 percent oxygen was reported in one clinical case gas. Gangrene can cause necrosis, gas production and sepsis progression to toxemia. And shock is often very rapid.  Other.  Necrotizing fasciitis affects the deeper layers of the skin. Norma is a gangrene of the face. Fournier's gangrene usually affects the male genitals and groin, Venus. Limb gangrene may be caused by Heparin induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis a chai tea tea treatment.  Treatment is usually surgical debridement wound care, an antibiotic therapy. Although amputation is necessary in many cases in the United States 30,000 to 40,000 amputations are performed. Annually. There were an estimated 1.6 million individuals living with a loss of a limb in 2005. These estimates are expected to more than double to 3.6 million such individuals by the year 2050.  Antibiotics alone are not effective because they may not penetrate, infected, tissues, sufficiently hyperbaric, oxygen therapy.

Grafts have also been used to accelerate healing for gangrene and other chronic wounds angioplasty should be considered if severe blockage in lower leg vessels tibial and peroneal artery leads to gangrene.  History.  As early as 1028 fly. Maggots, were commonly used to treat, chronic wounds or ulcers to prevent or arrest necrotic spread as some species of maggots, consume only dead flesh. Leaving nearby living tissue, unaffected this practice, largely died out after the introduction of antibiotics acetonitrile and enzyme to the range of treatments for wounds in recent times. However, maggot therapy has regained. Some credibility and is sometimes employed with great efficacy in cases.  Of chronic tissue necrosis, John M. Trombe old wrote Middleton, Goldsmith a surgeon.

And Joseph Lister Goldsmith, advocated the use of debridement and topical and injected bromide Solutions on infected wounds to reduce the incidence and virulence of poisoned miasma copies of his book, were issued to Union surgeons to encourage the use of his methods.  Etymology.  The etymology of gangrene derives from the Latin word gangrena and from the Greek gangrena gag ruina, which means putrefaction of tissues. It has no etymological connection with the word green, despite the affected areas turning black and or green and or yellowish Brown, it is coincidence that in lowland Scots the words gangrene go. Green can be said to be an egg corn for gangrene as it describes, the symptoms of the affliction.\",\n",

And for employers they can really get involved and support their employees by offering blood glucose testing and also,  Also, they may offer it as a covered health benefit. It's really a win-win for employees and employers. I see Mark shaking his head. So how does it really had a huge impact, a positive impact at your company? Absolutely. It helped us raise awareness of diabetes. How people gauge, whether they might be at risk and if they weren't risk, it helped them, take action. And how did you get them to buy in? Well, we wanted them to be interested in the topic right from the get-go. So we offered free on-site blood sugar test in our offices and the response was  Terrific people were already interested in this topic, some because of family history, some because of their lifestyle changes.

       " 'ufCiGz75DAk': \"Cell transport is the process of how things move in or out of the cell through the cell membrane. There are two broad categories of cell transport.  The first category is passive transport for a cell passive transport means it's an automatic process that doesn't require any input of energy.  For example, diffusion is a passive process in which particles move either into or out of the cell from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. The cell doesn't use any energy when this happens.  The second category of cell transport is active transport.  This is when particles move from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration.  When particles move against the concentration, gradient energy is required often to allow protein pumps to assist in particle movement.  Why would the cell need to move particles from a low to high concentration and expend energy to do it?  An important example is seen in your heart muscle cells.  In order for your heart to beat, there are certain molecules that have to move from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration for those cardiac muscle cells to work.  So, the main things to remember are passive transport happens automatically with no energy required, while active transport needs energy for it to occur.\",\n",

Most people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer are already in the advanced stage of the Disease, by the time it Scott. And the typical prognosis is death within five years. Only four percent of pancreatic cancer patients live beyond five years. In recent years, pancreatic cancer has claimed the lives of numerous celebrities and public figures. Including Steve Jobs actor. Patrick Swayze and actress.  Any Franklin leading many people to ask the key question. Are there any early warning signs of pancreatic cancer? The answer is. Yes, there are. But to understand these signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer. It's important to understand where the pancreas is and what it does located deep inside the abdomen, the pancreas is only four to six inches long and shaped like a tadpole in the tail of the pancreas or cells that produce insulin and tumors at this end are usually endocrine tumors. They're easier to  Knows but are much rarer at the other end. The head of the pancreas are cells that produce digestive enzymes and tumors at the sender called exocrine tumors. These are by far the most common and are much more difficult to detect. However, the idea that a pancreatic tumor is asymptomatic is a bit of a myth dig deep into Journal articles and ask patients, what they remember. And the result is a long list of odd signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer to watch out for taken one by one these symptoms could mean many things.  But if you find yourself, experiencing two or three of these early warning signs of pancreatic cancer, call your doctor and ask for a Scan Imaging techniques, such as MRIs can detect pancreatic cancer. Some of the time, depending on the location of the tumor, early warning signs of pancreatic cancer diabetes, especially if it comes on suddenly recently, the Mayo Clinic published startling research, showing that 40% of pancreatic cancer patients had been diagnosed with diabetes, one to two years before.  Before discovering, they had a pancreatic tumor researchers. Believe the diabetes is caused by tumors that simply haven't been detected yet. The problem is diabetes is very common. And the majority of diabetes isn't pancreatic cancer. So doctors are trying to develop screening tools. To tell the difference right now. They say family, history is an important clue. If you are diagnosed with diabetes, that seems to come on suddenly and you have no family, history of diabetes. Bring this to your doctor's attention and ask for further screening.  For pancreatic cancer yellowing of the eyes or skin. Even a small pancreatic tumor can block the bile duct in the head of the pancreas causing bile to build up. This causes jaundice itchy skin palms and So Lisa feet a little known side effect of jaundice is itchy hands and feet. It's due to a skin reaction to the bilirubin, the yellowish Brown, liver chemical that causes jaundice lack of appetite. An Italian study found that six to eight months before being diagnosed.  With pancreatic tumors patients, reported a sudden drop in their appetite and a tendency to feel full after eating very little changes in taste in the same Italian study. Some of the patients surveyed said they'd suddenly lost their taste for coffee wine and smoking. In fact, they said they felt disgust for the smell and taste of coffee and alcohol abdominal pain. Pancreatic cancer. Sufferers. Remember, this pain is annoying pain, rather than a sharp, cramp or ache, and it radiates toward the back.  The characteristic clue. The pain goes away. When you lean forward, an enlarged gallbladder, the same blockage of the bile duct that causes jaundice can also cause an enlarged gallbladder as the bile build up behind the duct. The good news is that an enlarged gallbladder can be seen on Imaging tests and it may even be possible for a doctor to feel it during a physical exam, pale floating smelly stools. If a pancreatic tumor prevents digestive enzymes from reaching the intestine. The result is an inn.  Body to digest fatty foods. So you end up with loose smelly floaters as a result of the excess fact. Doctors say this symptom in particular can be an early clue and is too often overlooked, dark, tarry, stools, bleeding in the upper intestines causes this symptom sudden, unexplained weight loss weight loss is not always. As many people mistakenly believe a sign of advanced cancer that spread to the liver. It can also happen because a lack of pancreatic enzymes is  Is causing fat to pass through the body, undigested. What do you do? If you're worried about any of these symptoms document all symptoms and report them to your doctor and is much detail as possible. If your doctor is convinced, you have legitimate concerns. And remember you may have to do some convincing test such as an ultrasound, a CT scan, and an endoscopy followed by a biopsy, can be used to search for a pancreatic tumor. A blood test is now available for a biomarker called, see, a 8:41. That is real.  Spy, pancreatic cancer cells. Unfortunately, by the time, CA 8:41 reaches detectable levels. The cancer, is usually no longer in the early stage. Although the test is useful during treatment and for detecting recurrence. Another biomarker test cea carcinoembryonic.

We see a little bit more of the glands are being produced. The blood vessels are in there. And this is where we get a lot of the parasympathetic nervous system in these outer layers, and so as you could see,  As you move into these deeper layers of it, we start to see more than neuromuscular areas then on the very end the part that's farthest away from the food or the first part that a surgeon would touches the serosa layer in this is the covering of the GI tract.  Moving back out as we kind of work our way down the GI system will kind of touch each of these particular areas. One at a time. We start with the oral cavity the pharynx it's in the mouth with it. And I think that this particular part is very intuitive for people. It's the mechanical digestion. The actual chewing using your teeth, the breaking down of the carbohydrates in particular with your teeth and your tongue with it. Saliva is a is produced from a lot of  These salivary glands in the mouth. And then, as you swallow the for The Fringe, your muscles contract and you push down into the esophagus with it. And as you move down in the esophagus, you get this idea of peristalsis and it's a word that's very commonly used. It's a very complex neuromuscular pattern. Your book doesn't emphasize all that. So I am not going to get into that. It's essentially the way your body moves the food from the mouth, all the way down into the  The stomach. It has a very rich vascular Supply to it from the Carotid the different arteries with it. We often divide the esophagus into three different parts of the superior, the mediastinal in the inferior part with it. The esophagus doesn't do much for breaking down the food. It is purely a pipe that moves material down into the stomach with it as the food gets into.  Stomach, the stomach is divided into four different areas, the cardiac sphincter, the fundus, the cardia. There's the body and then the pylorus is at the very end of it. There. These are not areas that are grossly seen. You can't look at a stomach and say, ah, yes. There's clearly, the fundus area. These are areas that are seen both histologically and are just vaguely drawn anatomically.  The stomach is more in the left side of the abdomen. It's in the left upper quadrant with it is immediately under the diaphragm with it. The exact size can vary quite a bit on individuals that can vary depending on your food intake and how you have been digesting over the last couple of days. And then obviously the stomach ends with the pyloric sphincter that empties into the small intestine with it.  Are the four areas do have slightly different anatomical parts to it? The body being the largest part, the pylorus being the part that's richest, in the blood. Supply needed, mostly to help get the food into the small intestine. There are three main arteries or the blood supply. That helps keep the stomach rich and full of nutrients. There's the left, gastric, artery the splenic, artery's and then one called the hepatic.  The common hepatic artery with it and that is something that the book emphasizes and could be used for testing which is what are the different blood supplies to the stomach.  The stomach clearly is a digestive process. It is very active, the stump, the food moves around in the stomach. It is very active. People can hear their stomach growling. They can hear it. The food being broken down with it. And as the food breaks down, it breaks into something that we call Keim CH ime some people do pronounce it. Chy Emmy, it can be spelled either which way and that is just the breakdown product of the food as it digests with it. And then,  Chyme, actually exit the stomach through the pyloric sphincter and into the small intestine, small intestine somewhere between 15 and 25 feet. If you were to take it and stretch it all the way out. However, in your body, it's somewhat balled up. It takes a very loop-de-loop type of tract. And so it is not a clearly 25 feet long with it. It touches every quadrant of your abdomen. It is a very frequent insult in a stabbing or shooting, or any kind of  Of penetrating injury only because it's this kind of twisting and turning type of path. It is divided into three different parts just to exhaust us more. You can't just call it the small intestine. The first part is the duodenum, the duodenum, some people call it then comes the jejunum, and then the ileum, all three of these parts do different types of digestion for the nutrients. And so we will talk about all three of these separately.  One of them is the shortest. It is a very c-shaped one. Part of it is hooked up to the stomach through the pyloric sphincter in the other part is hooked up to the jejunum. It is predominantly in the retroperitoneal cavity. We're going to talk a little bit about what that means in a little bit. And it certainly AIDS quite a bit in the digestion of nutrients with it.  The jejunum is where the bulk of the digestion, and absorption of all your nutrients, is people find this quite interesting. It takes nearly halfway through the GI tract till you're seeing the bulk of the digestion and absorption in the jejunum heart. You're not seeing the majority of it in the large intestine, or the stomach, which is a common mistake that people think, but it's the predominantly the small intestine in the middle of the small intestine where a lot of your absorption actually takes.  Place. The ileum is the terminal or the end part of the small intestine. It is about eight feet long. It actually has a valve at the end of it. This is quite emphasized at the end of the small intestine and the beginning of the large intestine is the the valve. The ileocecal valve is what is particularly called predominantly to Halt or to control the flow of nutrients into the  Large intestine the large intestine, is it almost a square-shaped process? It ends as you can see, in the right lower quadrant, the end of the small intestine where your ileocecal valve is dumping into the cecum. The intestine, the large intestine is one of the more odd structures in that you actually Ascend the first part of it, and you actually move up into the right upper quadrant. It's one of the few places in you buy that.  Actually go against Gravity, the food at that point, then moves across the transverse. Colon down the descending colon into the sigmoid before it moves into the rectum. The one thing I will emphasize on this slide is the appendix. It's noted in the right lower quadrant. They're just next to the cecum. We hear quite frequently of appendicitis. It's a frequent transport for paramedics is right. Lower quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting week.  Clinically think quite a bit of appendicitis there. And so, I will note that the appendix is actually part of the large intestine. It looks like a rat tail is off. Its frequently described. We suspect that it plays Parts in the lymphatic system. It is not actually part where the food or the breakdown takes place. And as you can see, graphically from this, to take out that appendix does not significantly limit your large intestine in any way, shape, or form.  The large intestine is about 5 feet long. It's responsible. Also, for ending, the reabsorption electrolytes and vitamins with it. It is a very large intestines. It's much bigger in diameter than the small intestine. It's very visually able to be seen. It has quite a bit of of arteries that help, keep it very rich in blood supply as it is, such a large.  An object in your abdominal wall. Breaking it down. Again. The cecum is the part that the the small intestine material dumps into. It is quite small. It's often described as a pouch with it, as you can see, it is right next to the appendix. So if you were to have a particularly bad bout of appendicitis, you could actually get some cecal irritation or infection with that. The ascending colon is in the right side. It moves from the lower abdominal.  Wall up to the upper abdominal wall going right. Near your liver in the right. Upper quadrant, the colon then turns and head Sideways from the right side to the left side in the transverse colon here. As it continues, the sigmoid dumps down into the rectum. The rectum is the very end of the large intestine. It is still considered part of the large intestine. It's about the last five to six inches of your large intestines and  that area is certainly for your fecal material. All digestion has been done at this point in time.  Stepping away from the actual GI tract but looking at your abdominal cavity as a whole, if you were a surgeon and you were to cut into your abdomen and you were to look inside. We divide the abdominal cavity into three spaces, the peritoneal cavity, the retroperitoneal cavity and then the pelvic cavity. These are not very easy to understand. This is something that's often very new for paramedics to understand. It's very common that the surgeons were to speak of these three spaces and  Me hear it a mentioned particularly. We use it when somebody is bleeding in their cavities. The surgeons will use terms like this as a retroperitoneal bleed or a peritoneal bleed or the bleeding is in the pelvis. Different organs are considered to be in these three spaces in particular, and we do appreciate them. When we open somebody up, the peritoneal space contains most of the organs of your abdominal area.  It would be more anterior or in the front closer to your belly button, the stomach the duodenum, the liver, the gallbladder, the spleen are all in this particular area. So as you can imagine a stabbing near your belly button, or to your abdomen is very likely to cause a peritoneal bleed.  Towards the back, we have a couple organs in this retroperitoneal space predominately the kidneys, the ureters that come out of the kidneys, the end of the duodenum, some colon, and then your pancreas is in the back. So stabs to your back stabs to the sides are more likely to cause a retroperitoneal injury with it. And that's a very common term that we would use in the emergency room and a critical care. Paramedic transporting a trauma would  Would be very wise of them to understand where this bleeding is coming from. As we could understand what organs would be affected by a peritoneal or a retroperitoneal injury. The pelvis is in the inferior part or the lowest part of your abdomen is contains your bladder, your rectum in the female retro, or ovaries, Fallopian tubes with it. And so, as you could imagine with gravity, if somebody were walking around with the bleed, most of the  Bleeding. We using gravity would fall towards the bottom of the abdominal compartment or in the pelvic space, any injury to the female reproductive system would cause pelvic bleeding with it. And so that is why we use these terms and I think it's important that paramedics are familiar with these terms. Although you won't be able to clinically diagnose whether something's in the peritoneal or retroperitoneal, but if you get report of one of these types of issues should help you understand where exactly they're bleeding.  Couple other terms. I wanted to mention they're not organs of the GI tract. They are in the abdominal abdominal cavity and there are things that I don't think are common. Commonly understood in the layman's terms are the ideas of an omentum and a mesentery and I want to spend a couple of minutes on these because many of you may never have heard these terms before, but they're quite important to the surgeons and any time a surgeon, opens, somebody up there stuck dealing with the mesentery in omentum, the  Harry is essentially a conduit or a vascular Network. It almost looks like a sheet of paper that helps connect all the organs so that they don't move when you suddenly stopped a car. Your intestines don't unfold and refold. Your liver doesn't move from the right. Upper quadrant to the left side. Everything kind of stays stuck to where it's supposed to be and the mesentery is this connection of these.  Tissues that keeps everything where it's supposed to be whether you're running or in a aggressive athletic activity, things don't rearrange inside of you. It's almost like the glue that keeps everything together. And within this area is all the nerves and the blood vessels that run throughout your abdominal wall. And as you could imagine, if you need to remove an organ, you have to dissect or cut out part of this mesentery.  In order to get to the organ, you can't just reach in and nicely. Scoop out your liver. You have to kind of cut out the mesentery or the glue that sticks this into its particular area. Similarly, is this idea of the omentum? There's two of them. We call it the greater and the Lesser omentum with it and it literally looks like a yellow sheet like a shade that's on a window that you encounter in your  Abdominal wall, and it is in the same way. It's fat. It's adipose tissue. And it is to insulate and protect these organs. So, as you can imagine same thing, when you do a surgery, you can't just easily remove it. You will have to go through the omentum with it. Same point in time, another transport that Critical Care paramedics will do quite a bit is for a small bowel obstruction, and we're going to talk a little bit about that when we reach the path of physiology part of this lecture.  But as you can imagine, once you destroy the omentum or the mesentery, it's not very easy to repair. It's hard to repair glue with this. We don't transplant, one person. So meant them into another one. And so once you destroy this in the surgeon has to remove an organ or take it out of the body to repair it and then put it back in your the way that all these organs are placed back into your abdominal. Cavity are going to be slightly different and all the twists in the turns of the  Small bowel the large bowel the exact location of these organs are forever changed and that can lead to some pathology. And part of that reason that we're having these problems is because we don't have any great way to reproduce and omentum in a mesentery after those have been removed or destroyed.  We've now gone through the entire GI tract. We started with the mouth. We went down the esophagus. We talked about the stomach. We talked about the small intestine the large intestine, and the rectum. We talked a little bit about what all those organs do for your body. In that regards. I want to then talk about all these accessory muscles or the organs that help aid. All these GI organs in what they need to do. We'll talk quite a bit about the  The gallbladder and the pancreas. As those are the three most important organs that your body uses. The liver is absolutely gigantic on a lot of skinny people. People, whose live ribs are very easy to palpate. You can actually feel your liver. You can feel it, often in babies and small children. It is in the right upper quadrant. It's right underneath your ribs with it and it is divided into two main parts. The right lobe and the left lobe.  It has a ligament that runs right down the middle dividing the, to the falciform. Ligament with it. That's very visible. Ligament. We see it quite a bit. When we do operations on people, there's the ligament is Terrace as well with it. And then hiding as you can see in this picture directly under the liver is the gallbladder. In fact, they're often what we call adhered or stuck together. They're very close in.  Anatomic position to one another. The blood supply to the liver is very important. The livers mean job is detoxification. You only have one liver, you can't live without your liver with it. And so most of the blood through your body. At some point goes through your liver, the artery Supply or the blood that runs to your liver is the hepatic artery. If you were to have one pump of your heart, 25% of their blood is ultimately going to go.  Oh right liver. That's how important the liver is to your body. And then out after the liver, kind of does what it needs to do the Venus output or where the blood comes out of, is the hepatic vein going directly into the vena cava.  I delivered as quite a bit. I don't think that we truly know everything the liver. Does we find that the predominant things that it does is number one, is the regulation of different metabolic features. It helps circulate break down the carbohydrates fats and amino acids the life supply of your body. It also helps circulate new red blood cells. It helps eliminate those toxins from your body and then it also produces bile that helps break down fats in  Healer with it. After bile is made it dumps into the gallbladder, which is essentially just a storage device. And then it is excreted into the duodenum. And as you recall, most of the breakdown of all, your nutrients is in your small intestine. And as you remember, the duodenum is the very first part of your small intestine, and so this makes a lot of sense that the bile that helps break down fats and all the nutrients that your liver create is broken down into the first part.  Part of the small intestine. It's not broken down into the esophagus, or the stomach. It's broken down into the small intestine in that predominantly, is because that's where the liver does dumped in all of these nutrients. The gallbladder as I mentioned, is actually attached to the liver and it will store and it will concentrate your bio at times. It will overly concentrate. Your bio inform gallstones, which is something I think we're all very familiar with and  In times when your right upper quadrant hurts after food, the problem is not that something's wrong with your liver, but it's often the gallbladder, because it's directly behind the liver, the gallbladder stores. This bio for when it's used. When is it needed? Well, when you have a particularly fatty meal, bile only breaks down fats, not carbohydrates only fats with it. And so when it is needed the cystic duct, connects the gallbladder to the duodenum with it.  It.  This bile knows. It needs to come out when it get when your body has a high level of cck. That is the go or the green flag. If you will, that the bile is needed to be utilized. Now. The gallbladder really is not a critical organ in your body. Millions of people live without their gallbladder every day. It is purely. A storage device for the bile. Bile is not made in the gallbladder. And  Is a common test question in the critical care as where's the bio made? The answer is actually in the liver. The gallbladder is purely a storage device for it. Many people get the gall bladder removed. Do they still make by? Oh yes. Does the bile still go into the duodenum? Yes, does it go into the gallbladder? Know the gallbladder is gone at this point in time. And so yes, you can live without your gallbladder. It is purely the storage device with it.  Moving now from the right upper quadrant to really the middle part of your upper abdomen is the pancreas. The pancreas is very deep in your abdominal cavity. It's near your back. It's closer to your spine than it is to your front. Therefore. It's in the retroperitoneal surface. So if your pancreas were to rupture open when we're to be bleeding, you would be having a retroperitoneal bleed. It is about 6 inches long, most surgeons describe it more as a gelatinous structure like jello. You can't just grab your pancreas.  Whip it out it because it actually somewhat melts. It has a lot of blood supply to it, predominantly through the pancreatic and pancreatic duodenal artery with it. And as you can see, it's in very close contact with your stomach, your small intestine and your gallbladder, the pancreas creates an awful lot of enzymes. Some of them are for digestion. We talked a little bit about the bile that helps break down fats. The pancreas also.  Oh, has enzymes that help break down fats, but it also has the enzymes to help break down carbohydrates lipids and all these other particular foods that you're eating. Those are called the exocrine functions of the pancreas. There's endocrine functions of the pancreas. In the one that we're most common with is insulin. If you're a diabetic, you don't have enough insulin. It's often because your pancreas was either created wrong or is malfunctioning with it.  I want to keep in mind that these integral functions. There are two other ones and we're not going to emphasize this. You book doesn't emphasize it. It's never been critical. But along with the insulin is the glucagon in the somatostatin, those help aid in these exact same, endocrine functions of controlling a glucose controlling your energy with it.  I want to emphasize again that these three accessory organs, the food never goes in the liver, never goes in the gallbladder. Never goes in the pancreas, but they are critical to aiding the GI tract and they're very close to one another. They have similar blood supplies. They're physically very close to one another and they work very close in hand in getting all these hormones to work with one another and that they if one of these were to go wrong, if the liver were to malfunction, it's very common to have issues with the gallbladder.  The pancreas similar when your pancreas is to malfunction. It's very common to have your liver start to malfunction as well. They work very hand-in-hand in homeostasis with your body.  We've talked about it a couple of times. I'll just make sure that I emphasize it one more time. This is the last slide on the GI particular, part of the physiology, which is the salivary ducts. There's the parotid Ducks, the submandibular glands in the sublingual glands. They are all there to help break down the saliva that goes immediately into your mouth and there are multiple of these that help make saliva.  That concludes the part of the GI Anatomy review. I did not go through every slide in depth. I want you the students to make sure that they're reading the book. They're understanding all the details of all of these organs. My goal here is really just to provide an overview of all these organs and to provide what I find to be the critical parts of knowledge. For those. We're going to move now to the urine.  Is system and just touch on this very briefly with it. Some books ID emphasize this urinary system in particular, but I did just want to touch on it very briefly with it. The urinary system, clearly begins with the kidneys. You have two kidneys, the right and left kidney. Their predominant job is to filter the blood. It deals a lot with making sure that your body is not too acidic or basic detoxifies, your body and then ultimately creates your  Ian.  Are the kidneys are small, they're bean-shaped organs with it out of the kidney comes the ureter. The ureters dump down into the bladder. And then the bladder, ultimately enters into the urethra where the urine comes out of the kidneys are very common in describing three zones. The outermost zone is called the renal cortex. The middle zone is the medulla in the innermost is called the pelvis with it in the each do different parts.  If you had a microscope and you were looking at the kidney, you would see what are called nephrons. There's hundreds. If not thousands of them in the kidney in these are the little working units of the kidney. There are many of them. They are always working inside your body and their main job is to regulate the acid-base of your body.  When you zoom in and you were to look at one of these nephrons, you'll see that the blood in the urine takes this very winding course with it with the blood supply, very intimately attached to these twists and turns with it. And the ultimate goal is to make sure that any toxins is not missed in the blood and any nutrients that may have accidentally been sucked into the kidneys are actually returned to the blood. There's this very long check and  Once and and medical school and we study the nephron we study every millimeter of this systems and understanding where in these little nephrons toxins, leave the blood. Any toxins are fully absorbed anything that's accidentally created into the urine. Actually has a chance to go back into the bloodstream. It's not highly emphasized in this Critical Care lectures, and it's actually quite complex. And so I'm not going to touch on that in particular.  Ticular.  Other than to mention just a couple of highlights. And again, these nephrons are microscopic. You can't see them doing this. It's far too too small to see with the naked eye. But there is one particular part. You'll see in the lower part where you see the descending in the ascending limbs there or Loops as we call it, the loop of henle and in this particular area is where most of the toxins are eliminated in the nephron with it.  The first part of it would be called the eight, the the arterial coming from the glomerulus. And then in the very end, the distal tubular is where a final check and balance is done the capillaries or the blood supply to it is ultimately where the Goodrich blood is eliminated. The urine is full of the toxins at this point in time the  After this moving of the nutrients in the toxins is done. The ureters remove the urine down into the bladder. I think we're all very familiar with the bladder when you get somewhere around 350 to 400 CCs of urine in your bladder. You have the urge to urinate. The urine comes out the urethra and you are able to avoid, avoid out your urine.  We're able to test very easily when this urinary system fails, or we call it renal failure, and it can be due to any four parts of this system when it fails, whether it be the kidneys, the ureters, the bladder, or the urethra on the slide here is a number of different reasons that you can have acute, renal failure, aarf as we call it, and I won't touch on these in. Great detail, their emphasized in your book. The goal is just to realize that there are a number of different problems that can go wrong in the urinary system.  To cause you to have failure of the system.  Well, touch briefly here on the reproductive system. It's not the emphasis of this lecture. However, it's not mentioned anywhere else. And so, the instructors wanted me to make sure that I at least mention these very briefly, not the emphasis of this lecture on the male side. We have the testes, which is in the scrotum. They have a number of protections with it.  The sperm is ultimately created in the significance of tubulars or the seminal vesicles, as they're called, draining into the epididymis. When stimulated sperm can be placed through the penis in the ductus deferens area. There are two ejaculatory, ducts. They pass through the prostate, which ultimately serves as the exit through the urethra.  A priapism is the first pathology that we frequently. See, it is extraordinarily painful. It's a prolonged erection of the penis. There are two different types, the so-called high flow, and low-flow. Neither of which you can tell in as a paramedic. It needs certain blood testing to be able to tell which one is with. It is very common with medications, as well as sickle cell disease to have one of those  The female reproductive system is all internal. You can't see it by looking. It involves the ovaries. There are two of them. The right and left that produce eggs, once a month. Those eggs has through both fallopian tubes down into the uterus, through the cervix and out the vagina. The monthly cycle is not something that is emphasized here. It's just the gross anatomy in this particular part. The  This or the baby when it's made is so hard in the uterus. When the cervix dilates up to approximately 10 centimeters, the baby will pass through a cervix and out into the vagina and out into the Evolve Euler area. The cervix is, the so-called exit pathway between the uterus and the vagina. Generally it is completely closed when a very complex hormone interaction begins. That's  When the cervix starts to dilate when you approximately 40 weeks pregnant with it, but the exact mechanism of that is not emphasized or even mentioned in your books. I am not going to emphasize that in particular, but I wanted to make sure that at least you had a visual of what these two different reproductive systems look like that. Concludes the first part of this lecture, which is the anatomy and physiology part. I know. That's a lot to take in.  Some of, which is very easy to understand, a lot of the macroscopic parts are very intuitive. You've seen before, you've learned before in your paramedic Class, A lot of these interactions of the hormones. The microscopic parts of this is new to you is very overwhelming. I would encourage you to read this chapter several times over and over again, ask questions of what you don't understand. My goal is not to make you all Anatomy experts with this point, but at least to make sure that you're aware of these.  Different anatomical Parts. Particularly as we talk about what can go wrong with each of these parts that you can understand what you're transporting and can help you anticipate what could go wrong when one of these organ systems fails.  We're going to move on to the second half of this lecture, which is really the pathology or what can go wrong in these different tracks.  We're going to talk quite a bit about GI problems. It's unfortunately, a particular system that can fail quite often with it. We're going to talk about not only how to assess if something's going wrong with the GI system. But ultimately how to treat with it.  The first thing we need to talk about is GI bleeding. I'm sure, it's something as paramedics. You have seen quite a bit. The first part that we try to do as Physicians is try to figure out where are they bleeding from? And we divided into an upper GI bleeding and lower GI bleeding and we really try to inquire. Is it bleeding from the upper part or the lower part? Because it's going to make a difference on the medicines we give and how exactly we treat it. And so we ask patients or if the patient's can't talk. We're going to ask the paramedics where they vomiting blood make me think.  It's more of an upper GI problem. Was it black or tarry stools, which would mean that the bleeding is probably in the upper part and by the time it gets all the way to the rectum that it's already black and dark. So black stools are tari. Stools are more of an upper GI problem or is it actually bright red blood that's coming from the rectum. And these are things that are very important. So if a patient calls you and says, I just blood in the toilet, as disgusting as it sounds, it's very helpful to take a look. Is it bright red blood that's coming out.  Is it black blood that's coming out? Is it somewhere in between almost maroon or purple blood that will help us tell if the bleeding is coming from the stomach, the small intestine or the large intestine. The other part of GI bleeding that we like to know is is it briskly bleeding? Are they actively bleeding right now? Is there blood on your sheets from the transport in? And how long has this bleeding been going on for?  We always talk about ABCs. We want to make sure that if the patient's bleeding is very brisk, that were monitoring their Airway or checking their vital signs. Are they very, tachycardic is their blood pressure. Very low, is it hard to feel pulses? Are they very thready pulse? Has these are all things that we need to know when we're managing a GI bleed. I wouldn't feed anybody. There should be no water nothing to eat or drink when they're having a GI bleed because the ultimate problem is that that food May obstruct our view.  To see where they bleeding from. And so make sure that the patient doesn't eat or drink anything when you get in contact with them GI bleeding and can be very fatal. We have a lot of medications that can thin your blood, that can make leading very worse. It feels like everybody. Nowadays is either on aspirin Plavix Coumadin. There's these new medications out there that can also thin your blood. And so we get very aggressive with making sure there are two IVs and these patients, we want large-bore IVs, we  I want to get very aggressive in making sure that we can stabilize these patients. Even if they're not briskly bleeding right now, your entire GI tract could be filled with blood and we just don't know yet how bad this bleeding is. And so, I would urge paramedics particularly with long transports for a GI bleed, patient to be very aggressive in getting that second IV in place. And not just settling for a 22 gauge IV in the thumb, but really putting an aggressive antecubital IVs in these GI bleeding.  Asians.  We fluid resuscitation patients. We don't want them to go into shock or very aggressive with starting. Normal saline bolus has in these patients when they get to the emergency room were very aggressive in making sure that we're typing in crossing their blood type that we are ready to give them more blood. If at all possible, we would encourage the paramedics. If you are able to give blood that if blood is being hung for GI patient. I want a critical pair paramedic that is capable of continuing that blood  Route, because that is awesome. Only what the patient is going to need.  Blood loss of anything over about a liter, a liter and a half is going to need to start to have blood replacement. And it is very easy to lose a liter of blood in the GI tract. It's very long if your stomach is bleeding. By the time, it moves all the way through the pyloric sphincter, through your small intestine, your large intestine that entire area can be filled with blood. And if they have one urge to defecate and they lose all that blood. It's very easy that you're already needing blood supply.  And so that's why we get very aggressive with these GI bleeding and we want you to really watch that hemodynamics the first sign that the bleeding. May be severe would be some mild. Tachycardia. They may feel a little weak and dizzy when you stand them to get onto your cot. Those are all things. We need to know as the Physicians because those are signs that this GI bleeding. Could be very extreme. We like to watch them on EKG, is all this blood loss can lead to arrhythmias the heart can suffer from this. It's not uncommon to  Really suffer a small heart attack, while having a GI bleed because of the blood loss with it. And so, I want these patients on the cardiac monitor. I want to know constantly what their heart rate is. If you're in route, in the heart rates, going, from 70 to 90, to 110, to 130 in route, that's worried about a patient that's decompensating. Even if they're not actively bleeding onto your cot. They may be bleeding internally into their GI tract. We want to know things like are they in continent? Are they having?  Amount of diarrhea either been constipated. Have they've been vomiting all day. Those are very important factors that we need to know from our paramedics.  Upper GI bleeds are about four times more common than lower. We're seeing a lot of this problem. It probably isn't a day that goes by that. We're not seeing them in one of our hospitals with it over 100,000 patients are admitted every year just for an upper GI bleed management. It's very common for us to see these. It's very common for them to activate a critical care. Paramedic. Some of them need very Specialized Care and we're transferring from facility to facility. And so this will be a very common call in your  Career that you see the death rate is about 10% in these that hasn't changed. They can be very lethal. We have seen many patients code in route to our facilities because of a GI bleed. That's why I want the IV fluid start immediately to IVs. Placed put them on a cardiac monitor. In this point in time. We are seeing all these blood thinning medications. The elderly patients. They're just not able to handle these GI bleeds. And so, we do need to watch these very  Civ lie in your ambulance, in the back. What causes them to bleed? While the number of things can go wrong, the most common are stomach ulcers. Too much acid, in the stomach, in the duodenum, even in the ulcer can wear away to the point that they start to bleed in them. They can erode. We're going to talk a little bit about varices dilated veins, a blood vessel rupturing open into your esophagus can be rapidly fatal. We're going to talk a little bit about mallory-weiss tears as well.  They are quite common in this day and age.  Lower GI bleeds happen. Predominantly in the large intestine. They can happen at the very end of the small intestine as well. These are also fatal somewhere around 10% of the time, one in ten will die. The most, common is diverticular disease, and we're going to talk quite a bit about diverticulitis and diverticulosis with it, because it is a very big problem, this day and age. We also see what we call avn's angiodysplasia. Has we seek answers and we see colitis.  Is causing GI bleeds in the lower tract with it, and we will be able to figure out what is causing these bleeds. However, despite the cause of them. They are all treated the exact same way, two IVs, cardiac monitor IV, fluids rapid transport to a hospital anticipate that these patients can go south in routing go south very quickly. We have to have a very high concern for these patients. You will never be faulted for being over aggressive in a GI.  Patient.  Let's move to another uh pathology that is very common particularly in the urban population. In the Milwaukee area peptic ulcer disease. These ulcers are very common, the mucosa of the esophagus this the stomach, the small intestine can wear away. It tends to expose areas of the GI tract and also is just what you can imagine is the wearing away of part of the lining peptic ulcers.  In the, the stomach in and of itself with them. We see that about 16% of all cesare in the stomach, somewhere around 30% are in the small intestine. They're also in the esophagus and so it's very difficult for us to tell where they are just by talking to the patient, but they can be very painful. They can cause nausea and vomiting and acid can't eventually treat. These they are predominantly diet.  Produced in nature, bad diet can lead to these ulcers. The peptic ulcers can bleed. If you wear away enough of the lining that you can actually wrote a blood vessel. That's very common. It was much more common in the past before and acids but peptic ulcers can wear away to the point that it wears all the way through the stomach, all the way through the intestines and you actually have stomach or intestinal rupture. And that is an emergency condition because essentially your stomach  Or your stool is draining into your abdominal cavity or your peritoneal cavity. And that is a true emergency resulting in immediate in emergency surgery, much more common before the invention of an acid, but it is possible that you could have a stomach ulcer or a peptic ulcer that goes so bad that it actually wears all the way through your stomach and then we need to take in and Patch out. We don't see that as much as these days has it actually roads to the point that it starts to bleed and a peptic.  Ulcer actually turns into a GI bleed from erosion into a vein or an artery. These vessels that they were into can be small, medium, or large the bigger, the vessel that it erodes into the bigger the GI bleeding.  Because these are predominantly upper GI bleeds, you may see the vomiting of the blood or you may see black tarry stools with it. Unfortunately peptic ulcer disease is very common to reoccur. Once you get all sorts you more common to get even more of them. And so a patient with a history of peptic ulcer disease who now having a GI bleed even if it was remote. It's very common that they have recurrent peptic ulcer disease. The most common reason we see them as people are taking ibuprofen Motrin.  Trent, Aleve or other NSAIDs, very common for wearing away, the stomach alcohol, abuse stress, very common for causing these ulcers to reoccur. We also see this disease called H. Pylori helical Factor by Lori, we know that that is now the most leading cause of getting these ulcers with it to treat them. We actually need to give patients two, if not three antibiotics to attempt to rid themselves of this helical path. Ha.  Infection the problem is is that it's often very difficult to treat. It's often goes quite a while to wear this. Helical bacter can get all over in the esophagus in the stomach in the intestines and it can be a very difficult thing to treat and patients will get reoccurrence over and over again. Infections with this you'll get bad ulcers. You'll get bad pain, it'll start to wear away and they'll start to bleed with it. And so peptic ulcer disease is a very recurrent  Once you get it, it's very common to have it for a lifetime.  Stress-related erosive syndrome is very common. These are stress ulcers that we see very similar to peptic ulcer disease. We know very common that they can be due to trauma. Two Burns to being in an intensive care unit to being on a ventilator. All these stress-related syndromes can certainly lead to stomach ulcers. Any patient who's admitted to an ICU at most hospitals automatically started on antacids to help prevent this from occurring. Because if a patient has  A severe head injury, a severe trauma, and then they get these horrible ulcers and they start to get a GI bleed. As you can imagine a body that's already under duress from a big surgery, a big issue and now is having stomach ulcers from all these problems is a lot for a body to take on and so ICU doctors. The trauma doctors, anybody who admits the ICU is very aggressive and starting antacid medications and monitoring for ulcers before they even begin.  This is often very fatal in these. I see you patience.  Long-term vent. Many of you will go to these long-term care facilities where patients are on long-term ventilators. It's very common for them to get GI bleeding. Even if all their problems are predominantly respiratory. And so I have a very low threshold for being very aggressive in these long-term vented patients. If they have a GI bleed, it's very common that it's an upper GI bleed. It's an ulcer in these patients can bleed quite heavily.  The problem is that most of these patients are immunocompromised. Their immune system is off focusing on their predominant issue. That landed them in the ICU, and the idea that they're normal homeostasis, and their normal immune system has been broken down and they are just more at risk. The problem is that to fix them takes more, energy more problems, because their homeostasis in their ability to heal, has already been compromised because they have another  Issue going on. This is a very common thing that we see in the hospital is these stress-related ulcers?  Next up we're going to talk about gastritis. It goes hand-in-hand with peptic ulcer disease. It is also leading to the erosion inflammation of the mucosa. This is what can easily lead to the peptic ulcers with it. It is very diet-related. It is a very common with this H pylori. We can see it. When we put a camera down this redness, this inflammation that can certainly occur with it.  There are a number of different kinds of gastritis. We can get it from stress. We can get it from autoimmune. In particular, we can get it from the H pylori. They're very common. They're treated very aggressively with anti-inflammatory medications. We can get gastritis when somebody swallows something that they're not supposed to bleach, very common with it. As you can see from the pictures. You can actually see the gastritis. It is on the skin level. It is very  The for us to visualize this and we want to get very aggressive aggressive with the gastritis before it leads to the peptic ulcers.  We see this in our cancer patients with their radiation. Unfortunately, radiation wears away the first lining of the stomach quite a bit and even small doses of radiation can lead to gastritis any of our breast cancer patients or any other cancer patient who's undergoing radiation. They're very aggressive with always starting an antacid right off the bat to help prevent this cycle from starting with the gastritis.  Varices is very serious. We see these a couple of times a year. They're very common in patients, who are alcoholics, who are cirrhotic who have liver failure. As you can see from these pictures. They're very dilated. Meaty veins, right in the esophagus. We can see patients have these veins ruptured open and they can bleed to death within minutes. It is often a very violent bleeding. They're bleeding is profound when they have this. It is very rapidly.  Patients are usually very sick at Baseline. They're not very healthy. They can often be a homeless population. A chronic alcoholic that you can find. If those types of people are having a GI bleed. That is a true emergency with it. It can happen from easy as eating something like a potato chip or anything that's sharp or crunchy. If one of these veins Breaks Loose, it can easily be a life-threatening emergency.  About 60 percent of all patients with liver disease. And we're going to talk a little bit about what causes liver disease in a little bit. Will develop these. Varices. They will watch any patient with liver disease. Sometimes every six months, sometimes every year by putting a camera down by looking to see if they have varices and the doctors are very cautious to tell them you have varices if you have any bleeding at all, you call 911 and you get shipped in to the emergency room because the mortality rate is well over 50% at  Teams with these bleeds. These patients need to often. Be intubated very quickly. These patients need to be started on blood almost immediately. These are the patients that I would make sure that you are taking very serious because they're bleeding, can be extraordinarily profound any  Any long-term liver patient has increased resistance, their blood flow. And so the bleeding that can occur the amount of blood that is in those veins can be quite massive with it. And the problem is that a lot of these veins have increased pressure behind them in any breaking loose can make them bleed, quite significantly and the rupture can be quite large to the point that they're platelets. Can't clog that up, many of these.  Nations also have a decreased immune system, decreased platelet count and can make it very challenging for these bleeding to stop. They often need either emergent endoscopy, which we'll talk about or emergency surgery as rapidly as possible.  Along those same lines not nearly as severe as what's called mallory-weiss Tear. And these are very common. These are little tears. At the end of the esophagus. They're often caused from retching from vomiting. We see this in people who are hung over there at home the next morning. They're vomiting quite a bit. The first couple of vomits are just regular vomit and now they're vomiting pure blood. This is something that we often see kind of early in the morning in the emergency rooms. I was up vomiting it seemed just like regular vomit.  Now Doc all I am is vomiting blood and what happens is all that integral intra gastric pressure from all this retching ended up causing a tear or a rip in the lower part of the esophagus that rip is called a mallory-weiss tear or mallory-weiss syndrome with it. These will often stop spontaneously with them. We often need to watch them in the emergency room. We give them medicines to stop the retching and antiemetics like Zofran.  Reglan Compazine, we give them some IV fluids and we end up ultimately monitoring them for several hours to make sure that this doesn't get worse. But this is very common. We see this in college. We see this in patients who are out celebrating. Maybe they don't drink as often. They start retching. They don't feel well and then they ultimately end up having an upper GI bleed.  On that note. I wanted to just take a pause as we end the kind of talking about the upper GI bleeding. We're going to move to the lower GI bleeding. On this idea of a patient has an acute abdomen. There's no Frank definition for what an acute abdomen is it is a medical term for meaning that their belly is very tender. I think something is very seriously wrong in their abdomen. The most common things that can cause a quote-unquote. Acute abdomen are gunshot wounds stabbings.  This is a ruptured aortic aneurysm which would cause severe intra-abdominal bleeding. But if you have a patient who's looks very ill is sweating, doesn't seem to be talking to. You seems a little bit altered you push on their abdomen and it seems very rigid. It seems like it's swelling with blood. They just seemed really markedly tender on your exam. You'll often hear a doc, say they have an acute abdomen. Now, that is not a particular disease. That's causing that there are multiple  All different diseases that can cause in acute abdomen, but I want you to just be familiar with that term. That usually means that someone is very concerned that something is very wrong in their abdomen. And anytime that there is a suspicion for any of those problems. That should be a rapid transport. It should be on a cardiac monitor. They should have two IVs in place. They should be large IVs, and they should be getting IV fluids. And they should be very aggressively monitored in route by a critical care.  And so if you hear that term, acute abdomen, I want your warning lights to go on and for you to be very concerned for that patient. Well, let's move to the lower GI tract. Now, we've talked a little bit about what happens when somebody bleeds into the stomach in the small intestine. We're going to talk a little bit about lower GI bleeding at first is that's a very common. I imagine almost all of you have transported somebody with a lower GI bleed of first. And let's do the big play right up front, which is the  Disease diverticula are very odd-looking. When you look at somebody they look like little mushrooms that have popped out of your colon in particular and they're very common in America. They're often due to dietary issues and they say up to about 70 percent of people will have diverticular disease at some point in time. When you look at them with the endoscopy and you go through the GI tract, as you can see, in this picture, they look like little  two holes have been punched out in your colon. They're very odd-looking as you pass through and they're very common. However, having a diverticula in and of itself isn't serious. There are two things that can go very wrong with them. They can get inflamed, or they can wear away to the point. They wear into a blood vessel and they can bleed. When they bleed, you have diverticulosis and it's very common. You'll hear Doc's, a osis bleeds, diverticular, bleed.  When these holes in your GI tract, actually perforate into a blood vessel and they can bleed. Sometimes this pain.  Can cause a quite a bit of inflammation and when these little pouches get infected or have inflammation, we call it Diverticulitis and they can get a lot of pain. That pain is predominantly on the left lower quadrant part of their abdomen. Sometimes it can be in the right lower quadrant of their abdomen obviously with right lower quadrant. We also worry that's where the appendix is. And so we often joke that diverticulitis is left.  Cited appendicitis with it. Oh, sis bleeds. Itís has pain is a very common saying in medical school. Diverticular. Bleeds are very common. They can be very deadly particularly depending on how big of a blood vessel they wear into. It's usually light red blood out of your rectum. It is very uncommon to have vomiting blood from a diverticular bleed.  When somebody has this, we get very aggressive in the hospital. We check their blood counts. We get them typed and screened. We get them blood ready in case it's needed and we call our GI doctors as they need to have an endoscopy. They need to know how many diverticula there are. How big is the bleeding? How big is the blood vessel? Sometimes we can fix these diverticular bleeds just with an endoscopy sometimes depending on how many they have, how many times it bleeding? Sometimes they need surgery.  The way we tell this is that we do what's called endoscopy? Or we put a camera either down their mouth or up their rectum and we are able to visualize what is going on. Now. This can be a little difficult at times if the bleeding quite heavily, we need to do a lot of suction to really see where the bleeding is coming from. If the bleeding too, briskly, we won't be able to tell where the bleeding is coming from. Secondarily if they just ate a Big Mac on the way in all that food is going,  Get in the way of seeing where the bleeding is coming from. If they have a lot of stool in their rectum, we're not going to be able to see the walls. And so endoscopy is not always the most ideal study. However, it is the most common thing that we start with to try to figure it out.  The other thing we can do is we can do what we call a tagged red blood cell scan with it. And that is we take some red blood cells because it is your blood. We put a nuclear tag on it. We take out your blood. We put this tag on and we actually put the blood back into your body and we take pictures of your GI tract and we try to figure out where those tag blood cells are coming out and bleeding from and that will at least give our GI doctor.  In our surgeons, a clue for what part of the GI tract is bleeding from. Do those red blood cells come out from the stomach? The small intestine the large intestine. We also use this if we think that they're bleeding in the small intestine, if we do what's called an EGD or we do an endoscopy down the mouth that scope can only get to the duodenum. We cannot scope from the mouth and get all the way through the GI tract. Similarly, when we do a colonoscopy we can only get two  the ilium or the end of the small intestine. And so most of the duodenum, the ileum, and the jejunum, we can't get with endoscopy. And if we think you're bleeding in that middle part, these tagged, red blood cells. Scans are something that we can use because endoscopy won't help us the other thing that's really done nowadays that we can do is we can actually poke somebody in the in a leg or an artery, and we can snake a little coil up.  You can actually put it in all these different arteries and see which one has broken loose. Now. That's a lot of contrast. That's a very invasive study. You have to put somebody to sleep. You have to snake these angiography coils into all these different arteries to see what is bleeding, but it is an option that we have to do angiography. Although we don't see that done nowadays in particular.  I'll say it once again because it is so, common in is so frequent that Critical Care paramedics. See these GI bleeds. I want you to be very aggressive. With ABC's, normal sailing giving blood putting them on a cardiac Monitor and taking these very serious.  I'll mention a couple of other things that we do in rare instances, will talk about some balloon. Tamponade will talk about at Tria tied. Octreotide a balloon tamponade tips procedures are all used for these various seal bleeds. These cirrhotic Shooters can rupture open veins. Anywhere in your GI tract. We'll talk. We'll show you a picture of a balloon. The the Blakemore tube in a little bit bactria. Tight is a medicine that is given as a drip. It won't help all GI bleeds, it.  Only helps patients who are having a variceal. Bleed tips is an emergency surgery where we try to decrease the pressure in these veins. You can't do it. Well, somebody is having an active variceal bleed but it is a liver surgery that can be done to try to decrease the pressure. And so if you have a patient is having a GI bleed and they tell you, I've had a TIPS procedure done or I've had a couple of tips procedures done. You should be very concerned that what they're actually.  Really having is a variceal bleed and I'll mention NG tubes now quite a bit. We're going to show you very briefly how to put these in later in this presentation. But if you put an NG tube down the nose into the stomach and what's coming up is bright red blood, you can be very concerned that they have bleeding is coming from the esophagus or the stomach. If they're vomiting blood, you put an NG tube down and all that's coming up as stomach acid. Yellowish green stuff, but no blood. Then you  Assume that the bleeding is probably coming from lower in the small intestine or the large intestine or the bleeding has stopped. So putting down, an NG tube allows us to analyze. The contents of what is coming up and help us kind of ascertain where this bleeding is coming from.  Often times, we will give and acids in these GI bleeds because peptic ulcers are so common for causing these bleeds. And so you will very commonly. See us give IV antacid medications in an attempt to try to help heal the ulcers that have worn away. And so, I put this slide in only because you will frequently transport, somebody who is on an antacid drip. The most common we see is IV Protonix and it would be very common for you to show up to  Patient having most likely an upper GI bleed from peptic ulcers and they'll be getting IV fluid possibly blood and maybe Beyond a protonic strip as well. And that is because we are assuming that this is ultimately a peptic ulcer bleed.  Endoscopy is very common. We can see the bleeding quite actively. The nice thing about doing these endoscopy is, is not only, can we see the ulcer? The diverticular believe the mallory-weiss, the varices that are bleeding, but we're also able to fix them. These are done by GI specialist. We don't do them as an Emergency Physician. There are some surgeons that can do this so that they can analyze. If the bleeding is brisk enough that they actually need to take them to surgery with it.  But you can often they'll come down to the emergency room and do this and this is usually the go to that. We will ultimately do to not only figure out what the bleeding is coming from, but they can also inject epinephrine. They can try to coil the bleeding and Endoscopy in most situations are actually able to fix the bleeding with endoscopy and then they'll go in days to weeks later and they will watch the bleeding to make sure it hasn't Reeb led to make sure the  Others are healing up and so endoscopy is really the way that we can identify ultimately what this bleeding is. And we can often fix the bleeding by injecting medicines or coils through an endoscopy to try to fix the bleeding.  It's a lot about GI bleeding. Let's move to some of the other pathology that we can see from the GI tract. Another very common thing. We see is pancreatitis. Somebody has upper abdominal pain. Nausea, and vomiting. We think quite a bit about pancreatitis. Those enzymes in the pancreas are very toxic to the body. A lot of the breakdown of your of your food can occur. And when those pancreas gets inflamed, it really can activate all those enzymes.  And it really goes into overdrive with it.  Inflamed pancreas can be an extraordinarily, painful phenomenon. You'll see patients yelling, screaming writhing in pain with it. All that pain is due to the release of these enzymes that the pancreas produces and these the blood flow to the pancreas. And the fact that the pancreas is in the retroperitoneum. And it's very deep, makes this pain to be very profound for patients. They're often nauseous. They're often vomiting with it and that is due to  All these releases of all these enzymes that normally shouldn't be released. So aggressively with it. The course or a pancreatitis can be from very minor to life-threatening. It is often something that will put patients in the ICU for they can get very septic. They can die. There's a lot of complications that can occur from pancreatitis.  When we think of it, we often think of Alcoholics alcoholics kanban burn out their pancreas, they can get pancreatitis over and over and over again. We see it at times when people go out for a bachelor bachelorette party. They're celebrating their birthday. They drink too much next thing, you know, they have this horrid upper abdominal, pain, nausea and vomiting with it. As you can imagine, this can worsen things. Now you have pancreatitis, you're nauseous your vomiting from pancreatitis. Now, you get a mallory-weiss tear and so these can really steamed  In the various, serious GI pathology.  You can get pancreatitis. If a duct gets clogged the most common reason a duct gets clogged from a gallstone that gets stuck not in the gallbladder, but it out of the cystic duct come on a stone and it can get stucked then not all this enzymes. That normally flows, very nicely into your duodenum gets stuck, your body tells your pancreas. Hey, we're not seeing into the enzymes and the GI tract so it produces more and more and more enzymes. The next thing, you know, they have pancreatic.  Titus, because they have a clogged gallstone.  We can get this quite often from medications, high blood pressure medications, are very well known for causing pancreatitis, high cholesterol, levels can cause this. With it. There are many different causes of this, not just alcohol. And one of the things I do caution paramedics is when these patients get these pancreatitis, we're often quick to say, ah this innocence me and alcohol induced pancreatitis, you know, this is this is, you know something they did to themselves.  In reality, we have to be very cautious. As there are many other causes of pancreatitis. That isn't something that they did to induce it. The pain is often described as constant boring radiating to the back it can start suddenly with it. These patients are often very profoundly in pain.  They can have nauseous, they can vomit. They can have tachycardia, their belly, can be very tender, some of the complications that can happen from pancreatitis. Is that the pancreas with all these enzymes that are being excreted, can also wear away into a blood vessel and they can have some bleeding. We call that hemorrhagic pancreatitis and the most common signs. We see that is called Gray's, Turner or Cullen sign, which is when you get some bruising, or it looks like bleeding around the belly button.  Or on the sides. And that is something that is quite rare. We don't see. But something that we should be looking for, which is any sign that this pancreatitis has converted to a hemorrhagic pancreatitis. The way we check for in the hospital's, we can check to see what the level of these. Pancreatic enzymes are. Now, we can't check for every enzyme in the blood work in the most common, we look for is amylase and lipase. We know that the lipase is far more sensitive and specific and so many hospitals will  only check lipase some hospitals will check the amylase and lipase. But when those are elevated, we get concerns that the patient has pancreatitis because there's two money of these enzymes in the blood.  We also look at a couple other data points and I mention these only so that you can understand where we're at to kind of determine how sick this pancreatitis is in a mild pancreatitis, or is it a major pancreatitis? We look to see if they're very anemic are their blood counts low. We look to see if their calcium is very low. That's very worried. Do they have a white blood cell count to? They have a high glucose are their liver function, starting to be affected. I mentioned that the pancreas the liver and the gallbladder.  Often are very intertwined. The more of these other blood tests that are out of whack. The worst. This pancreatitis can be.  We can do a CAT scan and we can see the inflammation around the pancreas and that will give us a detail. How much inflammation is there? How much bleeding is going on? Does the inflammation look? Like it's wearing into a large blood vessel. And so we will often do cat-scans on these pancreatitis as a way to also help us understand how significant the pancreatitis is. We can do an MRI, we can do an ultrasound. Sometimes those aren't quite as good as a CAT scan, but I just wanted to make you aware that  We do image, these patients to make sure that we know how bad their pancreatitis is. The other thing that can happen with pancreatitis that we need to be aware of is that they can what's called form cysts or pseudo Sith which are just like an abscess is a infection that occurs secondary to pancreatitis like an a inter abdominal infection and that's the other reason we do cat-scans is we want to make sure that there's not an infection forming around.  And pancreatitis because at times it needs very aggressive antibiotics. So what do you do? If you have a patient that you think has pancreatitis you keep them nothing by mouth. You don't want any stimulation that could increase. More of these enzymes. You want these enzymes to calm down. So we give them IV fluids. We give them pain medications. We give them anti-nausea medications will put an NG tube down because we don't even want stomach acid passing into the duodenum we want. Absolutely.  Nothing going into their small intestines. We will admit these patients to the hospital.  If things get very bad, we will ultimately give them what's called IV nutrition, or we call it tpn Total parenteral Nutrition. So that at least they can get some nutrients, but that nutrients will go through the IV. It won't go through the GI tract, it can take off in several days to weeks to get pancreatitis better. And so these will be patients again, very aggressive putting an IV in. Giving them IV, fluids giving them pain medicines, giving them anti vomiting.  And and they will ultimately very often be admitted to a hospital for management.  Let's move to the other accessory organ that we quite we talked about quite a bit, which is the liver when the liver fails, we call that hepatitis and many different, many different things can cause hepatitis. We can get it from different kinds of infections. We can get it from different kinds of medications in the liver. We have all different kinds of cells. Some of these dead cells, get removed. However, when it gets very inflamed, the ability to  Detoxify really goes down in a lot of these toxins can build up quite a bit and can make the liver worse and worse when you have what's called chronic liver, failure or fulminant, liver failure. Unfortunately, this is an ongoing issue in your liver will never get well acute. Liver failure is something that can often be fixed. The liver is able to fix itself over. There are many times that unfortunately, it can't chronically.  Do it and you will notice that there is a couple of precursors that we can tell and that you could be asking your patients if they have, right? Upper quadrant pain. If they have nausea vomiting, if they don't feel like eating, this can be leading towards a liver problem. Interestingly enough. We notice it quite a bit their urine can be very dark. Their stools can be very white. They can have yellowing of their skin or eyes which we call jaundice or scleral icterus.  They can start to get altered. A lot of these toxins that deliver breaks down can actually go up to your brain and we see patients being altered. They seem unusual. They're not able to answer your questions. They can actually even be comatose. That can be a sign that a liver problem is ongoing and we have a number of different blood tests that we can do to assess the liver function. The most common that we do, or what called an ALT in an AST. These are signs that you have to  Liver enzymes in your bloodstream. They shouldn't be in your bloodstream to that degree. We can check a whole other kinds bilirubin albumin. Ammonia. The goal is not necessary that the paramedic should know all these different lab values, but that when you're getting report and and the nurse or the physician, or whoever, you're transporting tells you that their liver function is off that their liver function is  Dated that you recognize that this is ultimately leading to a liver, failure picture.  There's not a lot we can do there are some medicines that we don't give by paramedics that we can try to help clear the liver. But this is ultimately supportive care with it. Liver transplants can be done. They are rare. They are done at only a handful of facilities, but that certainly is an option to help heal the liver.  I wanted to include here just a couple of slides on, what would be Normal and abnormal lab values. I'm not going to go through them one at a time, but I wanted to have these in here for your reference.  Again, the same kinds of things for pancreatitis. I'm not going to go through an exhaustive list of all the different things that can cause liver failure. As there are multiple. We worry a lot about medications that can do it a lot of different infections. You're all familiar with hepatitis B, hepatitis C. Alcohol can certainly ruin your liver. There are a lot of congenital problems that can ruin the liver. The goal is not always to know.  It is causing the liver problems. But to recognize that upper abdominal pain, nausea vomiting anorexia yellowing of the skin abnormal. Liver function will need to seek treatment and ultimately need an aggressive valuation for why they are in liver failure.  And that regards, I wanted to talk a little bit about some of the devices that we as Physicians used to help control the GI and GU system. I think we've all seen dialysis catheters. Before these are used, when the kidneys fail, not the GI system, but the GU system, when the kidneys fail, if the patient can get a kidney transplant, that's phenomenal. If they can't get a transplant. What we do is ultimately put these catheters in most commonly in an arm or a leg. It can be an upper.  Merle or armed with them. It is where we connect an artery and a vein together, where we ultimately will take the patient's blood out of their system, run it through a machine and back through. If one, we put a catheter in because we're connecting to blood vessels to each other. It takes several weeks to months before you're able to use that, we say that the shunt needs to mature. So before we can do that, we actually put special IVs either in there.  Neck, their shoulders or their chest wall, and there's a number of different kinds of these that you'll hear about what we can do. Dialysis through these kinds of catheters, in particular, as a paramedic, we shouldn't have much to do with these catheters. If they're infected. They should be handled with care. The bleeding from a catheter or a shunt in the arm can be very severe direct pressure and  A transport is certainly recommended with these types of devices. NG tube is also something that I think paramedics need to be very familiar with. And in many agencies. You can actually put in NG tubes and they're used for a number of different reasons. If the intestines are obstructed, you can help by decompressing the air by putting an NG tube in and then hooking them up to suction. We can suck out any contents. If somebody overdose we need to  to take out their pills. We want to suck out the stomach and NG tube can do that and then it can also be used. Like we talked about for pancreatitis or any times you want to rest the intestinal tract. The biggest things for critical care that we want to make sure is that we know how to check placement that you can confirm. It's working how to put them in and certainly make sure you don't pull them out in route.  There are other kinds of NG tubes. Most commonly. We call them David Hoff tubes or feeding tubes. These are much smaller in diameter with them and they are not for sucking out blood, they are not for any sort of diagnostic tests. But for people who can't eat someone who just had a esophagus stomach surgery, somebody who may be anorexic and having problems eating, we can put these small tubes in and deliver feeding through.  This tube and have it dumped right into the stomach. And those can be kept in for several weeks at a time. They're called feeding tubes, or David Hoff tubes.  I want to mention this very briefly how to put an NG tube in. Some of you will do this in your career. Some of you will never do this in a career. It's best to have the patient sitting up. It's very difficult to put them in. When a patient is lying flat. You want to ideally numb up the nose if at all possible, it's not always used. You want to measure my going from the tip of the nose. You want to go around the ear and then measure it down to the xiphoid process and you want to mark that either with your finger or a piece of tape.  You know, how long of to stick the tube down?  You then lubricate, the NG tube, so it goes down very smoothly and when you put it in the nose, you often want to put it straight back and we tell nurses young Doctors, medical students paramedics, when they learning how to put these tubes in. You don't want to aim it up towards the eyes. You don't want to eat it down towards the nose. You want to put it absolutely parallel to the floor and go straight back as it goes straight back. The tube will naturally. Start to curl down to the esophagus.  We often will have patients drink or sip water with a straw to help open up the esophagus the sipping of the of the water also helps distract them and gives them something to do. So, they're not focused at all. I'm putting the NG tube back.  You want to advance the tube slowly and firmly some patients will slightly gag as it as it goes down, then gagging should resolve itself after it hits the stomach. And so I often will tell patients before I put a tube down that this will be a little miserable for 30 seconds or so until we can get the tube all the way down. You want to really watch their arms, some patients, as you putting this down will reach up and try to grab the tube out and you want to have somebody there to potentially watch their arms, so,  You don't get the tube down the patient panics and rips the tube out. There's a number of different ways after the tube gets down into the stomach and into your mark that you want to confirm that the placement is just so you can squirt a little bit of air down the NG tube with your stethoscope. You can listen over the stomach as you're seeing in the middle picture here. If you hear a lot of stomach gurgling and are going in, when you squirt that water or Aaron, you can confirm that it's in placement. You can then  Suck back a little bit. And if yellowish green material comes out, you can be confirmed that you're getting stomach, contents out.  Most importantly, in my opinion is to make sure that this tube is very well secured to their face. The last thing you want to do is put the patient through getting this NG tube in only to have it slide out in route. And so to tape it to either an endotracheal tube or the face or to use a commercial attachment devices, very strongly recommended.  There are other tools that we use longer-term, gastrostomy tubes, jujin, ostomy a tubes. That can be put in by a GI doctor, a radiologist or a surgeon. These are from more long-term feeding and they're very common. In patients, either in long-term care facilities, nursing home, facilities patients with cancer, very frequent transports with it, and they are when the food will not go through the esophagus or the mouth, but actually be dumped directly into the stomach or the  Small intestines with them and they can be very long and they can be very short.  In length, they are secured into the stomach with a little balloon as you can see. And then they're often adhered to the skin with a bumper.  They're very frequently used in all ages of children, adolescents and adults with them and there's something that you will see accidentally pulled out every once in a while.  In the emergency room where able to replace the G tubes as the amount that you have to put them in our very small, it's relatively easy procedure to replace them. However, I do want to make note that some of these tubes actually go into the stomach, through the pyloric sphincter and actually into the small intestine. It can be a duodenal tube or a jejunal tube. These are much more complicated to put in and you can put these in for not only because as we mentioned, most of the absorption of nutrients is done.  The small intestine. These are much longer. These are little more complicated to push in. And so these are much more challenging when they get pulled out to put them back in and us in the emergency room, often need a specialist to assist with these.  And so, when you get called to a problem with one of these stomach tubes, the most important question is, what kind of tube is this? Is it AG tube that goes into the gastric part of the stomach. Is it AJ tube? That goes into the jejunum. Sometimes there are would call the D tube or one that goes into the duodenum that will help us at the hospital. Determine what needs to be replaced. If you can even bring in the pulled out to where the malfunctioning tube or the  Too, that is equally as helpful to us. I will make mention that there are these GJ tubes, where they have two ports, one for the stomach, and one for the intestine, and what those are often used for is as a pill that needs to digest in the stomach can be put in the G part of the tube food can be put in through the J, part of the tube so that it digest and those are becoming much more common for you. Folks, if they just happen to have one of these tubes, you  It to make sure that they are secured, that they're not loose, that they're nicely a tape down and secured. You want to make sure that there's no bleeding infection or leakage around the tube. And you want to make sure that the tops or the little stopcocks on them aren't open or can become dislodged in route.  Less common is what is called a t-tube and I know this feels like it's alphabet soup. And I apologize. There's g to g ET tubes, T tubes. It's absolutely exhausting to keep all these straight 80 tube is something that we really only see after gallbladder or liver surgery and they're relatively rare nowadays. And they are named because their t-shaped. If the bile is spilling out, if there was a complication during a surgery to remove a gallbladder, we don't  Their bios spilling into the intra-abdominal cavity. And so, we will put one of these devices. In what will be in that tube is actually the bile of the patient that usually not permanent that is just to allow that area to heal with it. But it's very important. If a patient has a big coming out of them that you want to understand where that bag is attached to and what is the specimen that's coming out of it. So if a patient says I have 82,  Tube in place. You can assume a couple of things that they likely recently had a gallbladder or liver surgery. And that what should be draining out is bile.  This can put a bottle leader into this bag, at one point in time and they can stay in for well, over a month at a time. And again you want to make sure that this tube is very secured. You don't want this pulling out because then the bio will be spilling into their intra-abdominal cavity and with well, over a liter produced each day, even in the short transport in. You can make that patient quite sick. And so, you want to make sure that these teabags are well secured you want to assess how much drainage is in them?  Unfortunately, there are some patients who we can't use a G-tube a j-tube in either their esophagus or the stomach due to cancer or a bad blockage needs to be removed or is unable to be used at some point in time. And we need to feed them by alternative techniques. In the most common is what we call tpn or total peripheral nutrition. This is a science. It's still being perfected. It's really not ideal, doctors are would prefer. Not  Use tpn. It's often a last-ditch-resort nutrition and it's essentially IV nutrition. It needs a nutritionist, a pharmacist to very cult very closely calculate what goes into these bags, but it really is a last resort. Unfortunately, tpn can lead to pancreatitis there. Can unfortunately be germs bacteria that can get into these bags. It doesn't always do a great job of nutrition. They often need to be given  Louis 24/7 to keep the patient with nutrition. There's often a reason somebody's on tpn. They're usually not the healthiest people at Baseline and they're very at risk, for either getting thrombosis or embolisms due to these frequent changing of these bags. And so we really need to watch for complications with our patients, who are on a TPM.  An air embolism is just what it sounds like. It's a little amount of air that gets into the blood supply and it's most common. When you're changing. These IVs, tpn is often not given in a regular IV. It's often given in what we call a PICC line or a central line. So that tpn can go into a major blood vessel. Not a peripheral one in so these are embolisms and thrombosis or clogs that can occur can be very serious in  You'll see patients are transported quite often because their catheter or the IV that the tpn accidentally falls out. May become infected needs to be changed and we want to get those changed as quickly as possible because these patients often need this tpn. It needs to be given 24 hours a day and that they can't go quite often long periods of times without receiving their tpn. And so you will get transports for this. You want to make sure that that area.  Is quite clean that it's covered that. Any bleeding from the area is dealt with with direct pressure.  I promised you earlier. I want to show you these Blakemore Minnesota tube. Some people just call the Minnesota tube. Some people call them Blakemore tubes. As you recall. These are tubes that we put down the mouth. When somebody is having a variceal, bleed often a patient who has liver failure cirrhosis, maybe a chronic alcoholic with it. We don't put these down very often. I would argue that. These are very rarely placed in the emergency room. Our preference would be to intubate the patient to have  A specialist, come in and do an endoscopy a surgeon to do surgery. But if the bleeding is massive with a very sealer, an upper GI bleed. We can put one of these tubes down. They can be put down the nose. We often will, just put them down the mouth. We inflate these large balloons in a goal to apply direct pressure to the bleeds. You can't stick your finger down their mouth long and are far enough to really pressure, these various seal bleeds and so this  This is a way to try to tamponade or apply, direct pressure to these bleeds. What we do is we try to put them on a pulley system so that they we inflate them and then we pull them out of the mouth so that it is nice and taut with it. And one of the traditional ways of doing this is by putting a football helmet on the patient. After intubating them after putting down an NG tube after putting  On a Blakemore tube and tying the end of the Blakemore tube to the base guard of a football helmet. And so one of the running jokes in the storage rooms of the ERS is why do they have a football helmet in the storage room in the answer is most often in case, we have one of these bad variceal bleeds with internally. They look like this where you have one of the balloons, try to tamponade right at the esophageal stomach.  Border one in the esophagus one, in the stomach in an attempt to try to inflate it as much as possible to slow down the bleeding. These are very uncomfortable for patients. They are a last-ditch heroic effort. The vast majority of patients will need to be intubated and sedated, and put to sleep before one of these tubes, put out are put in, and these are often patients, who are absolutely critically ill have vomited large amount of blood.  Are getting IV, fluids and blood. And I wanted to make you aware of these tubes. Although, my suspicion is, none of you will ever see a Blakemore or a Minnesota very sealed tube placed, but I wanted to, at least make sure that you are made aware of them. Obviously, if an NG tube is down your want to go to want to do, lots of suction, to get that blood out. I would strongly recommend intubating the patient before transporting. If they have one of these in, and then sir.  Certainly, a big concern would be that you inflate the balloon so much that the esophagus gets so dilated that you're actually pushing on the airway and that they would actually have problems breathing with these tubes. In if they have any problems breathing at all. You're going to want to try to deflate the balloons. Unfortunately, that may make the bleeding worse, and that regards, you're going to want to make sure that these balloons stay tied and that they don't wiggle.  Loose and any, which way and these can be a very challenging transports with these major bleeding patients.  The next bag that I want to talk about is an ostomy bag. I'm sure. Most of you are very familiar with these. These are attached to the surface of the abdomen. After the intestines, get resected. The patient, doesn't have bowel movements the stool. The fecal material actually goes into the bag with it and because of this having bowel movements or defecation is not controlled because you don't have your rectal sphincters like you used to  I talked to paramedics quite a bit about these. Hasta knees and I tell them, it's important to know where the ostomy is again, in the GI system. Is it a KO loss to me, where it's the large intestine that's connected. Is it an ileostomy where the small bowel is in test in a collected and you want to know? Because it will make a difference for us. What is wrong with the patient?  You can empty these before transport. Many patients know how to empty these themselves. You want to look at the tube. What's coming out. Is its tool, is it? Blood has any of the intestines instead of being at the abdominal wall? Has it actually fallen into the bag is the intestines that you can see they pink, or have they turned black or ischemic at all? Is the bag nicely attached.  The surgical creation of the ostomy is called the stoma with it, and it can be the small intestine and the large intestine with it. It is not painful to touch, it can wiggle or have peristalsis with it. Like the picture on the left here, some of it can actually be sticking out of the skin. That doesn't worry us. Sometimes several inches can come out of the skin. It would need to be placed back in by a surgeon or an ER doctor, but you want to look at that and test.  Before you transport doesn't look pink and normal or does it look very red beet, red. Like there's an infection there. Does it look black? Like, the blood supply has been cut off, so you not only want to look at what is coming out of the ostomy, but you want to get your pen light and you want to try to examine what the intestine looks like in the stoma or the ostomy emptying, an ostomy pouch is something that you may need to do. If you have a long transport, you don't really want to be doing this in route.  With the fecal material is often very smelly. It's very disgusting. The last thing you want to do is get halfway in a long transport and realize that you need to empty their ostomy bag it as much better doing at the home at the nursing home before transport with it, patients or staff. At the facility, should be able to assist you in doing it. I do want to mention it here just in case this ever comes up, but at the very end away from the stoma is often a clam.  You can undo the clamp and just use gravity to help drain out the bag. Very often, the same bag can be used. You don't need to replace the entire bag with it. All you need to do is re-clamp the ostomy and then you can roll the stool down a toilet with it. The biggest thing being make sure that your clamp is on securely that any rolling that needs to be done, has been completed. Because the last thing you want is for this to leak the entire.  Weigh in on the transport.  The other very common catheter that either you will place in your career that you will see, is that what we call a fully catheter or urinary catheter. There are two different. Kinds there are what we call straight catheters which patients or staff will put in drain the urine and pull right back out otherwise called the temporary or in and out catheter or there in dwelling or chronic of Foley catheters, which I'm sure almost all of you have ever seen before.  These can become quite complicated. There are frequent ER visit for us. They can become clogged either with an infection or if they're bleeding. You can have a little blood clot. You can get UTIs or infection. They can leak around the Volvo or the penis, or they can become dislodged or pulled out with them. We really want to make sure that the patient's don't pull them out. There is a balloon that gets blown up into the bladder. And so pulling on the balloon can either rupture the bladder open or in a worst case scenario the patient.  In skin, tear their urethra, by pulling these balloons out, quite a painful, and bleeding event with it.  I'll mention again how to place these again. I suspect that. This is something that you would rarely do in your career, but it is something that I want to make you aware of how to do. It is a sterile procedure. You do not use regular gloves for these what you want to make sure that you insert the catheter all the way in until you see urine flowing from it. You want to blow up the balloon that goes into the bladder and you want to lightly, pull back on the catheter until you  Reach some small resistance. You want to make sure that the catheter is obviously hooked up to the bag and then it is Flowing nicely.  Same procedure with the mail. In fact, many people argue putting a catheter in a male as much easier than a female. The complication with the male is that the prostate can often add some resistance and can make it challenging to get all the way to the bladder. There are special catheters that we use called a coup de catheter. If there were ever any problems getting past the up prostate.  I'll mention these. These are rectal tubes. They are temporary. They're often used for patients, who are having a profound diarrhea and are in a bed bound State. They are as you imagine. They are tube that goes up the rectum with a goal to ultimately collect all the diarrhea that is occurring in. These are certainly just temporary in nature. Nothing that we would keep a permanent, the patient needed, something permanent. We would move towards more of an ostomy bag. Rectal tubes, do come out.  Actively easily. And so, you want to make sure as a critical care paramedic they are secured that they are well in place. Any balloons are well inflated and you want to make sure that any sort of bleeding is identified.  There's a couple of different surgical drainage systems that I want to make you folks aware of, there's what we call a Penrose drain. They look like little pieces of plastic. They often look like they would be part of a Foley catheter that is cut. They can be flat and they are often sewn into a surgical wound, either to keep infection like pus or blood out of the wound. They are open on one side. And so, the blood or the pus will often just  Right out from them there for some four-by-fours or some gauze around them would be very good idea. They are often stitched in there. They don't come out. We often Stitch those into place, but I want to make you aware of them. So that you know, what a Penrose drain.  Looks like a little bit more formal than a Penrose. Gene is what we call a JP drain or a Jackson Pratt drain. They're often called Grenade drains as well. The interesting thing about these is these are often to collect blood in a surgical. You can place them anywhere. They're very common after breast surgeries. Next surgeries abdominal surgeries. There's often more than one I've seen up to five or six of them placed in big surgeries. The thing about them is that they're under suction. And so if the grenade is  We blown up or looks like a grenade, they need to be opened and they need to be emptied. But for the suction to actually be activated, you have to squeeze them so that they are are flattened. And then you close them for the suction to actually work that they will not work if they are just kept in the grenade fashion.  Ahima, vac drain looks similar. They're a little more rigid than a Jackson Pratt drain. They will be the same thing. They won't be held into place by a stitch and they will slowly drain the blood. They are a little harder than the usual but they are drained by the same exact way. They must be flattened in order for the suction to work. They look they work exactly similar to a JP drain, but they are circular instead of grenade.  Peritoneal, dialysis is very common. We see these patients often able to manage at home all by themselves. Unlike patients who have official in their armor leg. Peritoneal dialysis is done in the abdomen. Often. The lower abdomen. Peritoneal dialysis is often done at night while the patient's sleeps. There are often able to manage it all by themselves, unfortunately, because people do it all by themselves, these drains can get infected and their abdomen.  Infected, as so-called peritonitis, these patients are actually often smart enough that they can give themselves IV antibiotics at home through the drain when they start to get infected.  Unfortunately, these catheters can fall out. The infections can get quite severe and they can be called for transport in any newly placed. Catheter is at risk for bleeding. So, please make sure that they're properly secured that the patient or yourself. Doesn't accidentally pull them out. Well being transferred and please note that these catheters often go very deep even into the retroperitoneal area or the pelvic area of the abdomen. And so you want to be very cautious with removing them because there could be  Up to a foot even more of the catheter actually into the patient.  General checklist, for all these tubes certainly needs to be considered by a critical care paramedic, you want to know what's their purpose? What fluid is coming out of them? Is it properly secured hasn't been emptied. What are the potential complications that can arise from these tubes so that you sound knowledgeable and that you're up to date on what these lines are for these patients when they are taken into the hospital.  That's my last slide for this is has been a long lecture. There's a lot of information in it. It's exhausting, not only to lecture about, but to hear, there's a lot of anatomy. There's a lot of physiology to take in. I did not read every slide verbatim. Please make sure you're reading the book referencing, the slides to make sure that you are aware of all the information. This is not an exhaustive, anatomy and physiology lecture.  Nor is it a pathophysiology lecture? There's a lot that can go wrong in the GI and gu tracks. I've tried to cover the most important.  Pathologies that can occur. I've tried to cover what we use as Physicians to try to alleviate. These pathologies talking about endoscopy is the various tubes that we use, how we deal with all these different, pathologies.  Please ask questions, share experiences discuss what you have done during these transport to make them as easy as possible with it. It takes quite a lot of time to wrap your head around this chapter. There's a lot of information. And so, please make sure that you are revisiting it over and over again. As one time through this material, is not going to be sufficient. And please make sure that you're looking at the diagrams, trying to get a visual of how all these different.  And diseases, the anatomy flows together. Make sure that you understand when something goes wrong with the patient that you are understanding, why it is going wrong and what are the potential complications that can occur in route, but I'll leave it at that and make sure that you're asking questions and understanding the material. Thank you for your time.\",\n",

You may not even be aware how bad off you are, because your doctor is measuring your blood sugar and fat levels in a fasting State, typically drawing your blood before you've eaten, but what happens after a meal, maybe a stronger predictor of heart attacks and strokes. Which makes sense. Since this is where most of us live our lives in a Fed state.  And not just in diabetics if you follow non-diabetic women with heart disease, but normal fasting, blood sugar, how high their blood sugar spikes after chugging some sugar water appears to determine how fast their arteries continue to clog up perhaps because the higher, the blood sugar Spike, the more free radicals are produced.  So what are some dietary strategies to improve the situation? Thankfully improvements in diet exert profound and immediate favorable changes.

       " 'LtPgYc0mk': \"The big debate of artificial sweeteners have never been as big as it is today. Artificial sweeteners have been deemed dangerous for your health after heavy fear-mongering and links to problems ranging from headaches to cancer and the one artificial sweetener that has taken the most assault is aspartame. The people that have already heard of aspartame, generally have a bad opinion of aspartame for those of you that never heard of it. Well, if you ever drank a diet soda, you most certainly have consumed aspartame as well. So what exactly is  Is so wrong with it. Let's look at what happens to aspartame within the body Aspartame is broken down to phenyl, alanine aspartic acid and methanol outside of people with a rare genetic disorder known as phenylketonuria phenylalanine and aspartic acid are generally safe to consume since their amino acids that exist in pretty much any source of protein, but the big bad wolf of these three is methanol methanol can definitely be toxic for your body in very high amounts because your body converts methanol into a proven dangerous.  Known as formaldehyde, many anti aspartame, folks would tell you to avoid aspartame exactly for this reason, but the studies unfortunately doesn't back it up. Reason being is because the amount of methanol from aspartame consumption is well, extremely small. And at such small doses, the added methanol into the body, simply doesn't do anything to the body. In fact, your body produces formaldehyde every single day in amounts, thousands of times, greater than you can get from aspartame. It's just simply not enough.  Enough. And on top of that, one study has subjects consuming upwards, 200 mg of aspartame, per kilogram of body weight, which is 40 times greater than the average American Daily consumption yet. Still nothing. No methanol poisoning, nor changes in formaldehyde levels in the body as far as causing cancer. Well, the American Cancer Society themselves have looked at studies containing as much as five hundred thousand adults and found that there's simply no strong link between Cancer and aspartame, another, cause for concern.  Is weight gain pure drink diet soda so they can lose weight, but wouldn't it be pretty darn crappy if that same diet soda, actually make them gain weight. Well, good thing is that it doesn't know causative studies has ever shown artificial sweeteners, causing weight gain 16 month. Long study even showed that substituting regular sodas with diet soda is as effective as substituting with water in terms of losing weight. And in case you're wondering, aspartame does not Spike insulin levels in healthy individuals as  As well as diabetics, but you've probably seen people that drink diet soda and noticed, that they're pretty big, what? The real problem might be that they just underestimate. How many calories you are consuming by drinking diet soda. They think the zero-calorie means they can eat more and chances.

Learn from a class graduate and a practice manager about their experiences with this program. Good morning. This is Pat. I'm here with Tony who participated in the diabetes self-management agent education course, we offer here in Lawrence.  Just about a year ago and Sufi way the practice manager who is engaging her Medicare and dual eligible patients with diabetes or pre-diabetes to attend class.  Well, I learned through it too. So and God, do you? And the reason is just that I'm looking for classes like this, so to attend. So when classes do come up soon and Doctor you will tell me and give me the information how to attend the classes.  I have diabetes and it's very important to me to give educated on it. And that's why I attended the classes education. I learned how to eat. I learned how to read the labels. The class was excellent for me.  This will be important like yourself. You came across, you were very understanding when we were going too fast. You're slowed us down or going to slow your speed us up so that you know, the instructors were very important to the class.  It it's made a big impact because at one point my sugar was out of control. My diabetes was out of control and I felt that after the class I can maintain it. Well, one of them is when I made a meal like a breakfast and what would happen is I would I would just make my regular breakfast and then we put it on the board and it showed how much I was over.  You know what the Cubs and the facts and everything, the cow everything.  Then to the class, I learned how to make a man.  And I had the book that was a book and into us. So we knew exactly what meal to make.  And how to keep it within its range.  And it worked perfect. Well when you hear other people talk and there was one gentleman that he had his own physical issues and he came to the class and he came to the class to get educated on Diabetes to educate his son, who was dealing with diabetes.  Well, the value is that patients learn and they're engaged and they're educated Panic, put some ownership on them for controlling their diabetes because we can sit and dictate do this, do that. Take your medicine. Eat this your A1C level needs to be that but if you don't help them learn how to manage their disease, they go home and they don't know what to do. So, this class, I saw people that thought they knew a lot about diabetes, who came to me afterwards and said, wow, I didn't really know anything, and now I know what a carbohydrate is. And now,  Know how many carbs I can eat and I didn't realize that I couldn't have two bowls of rice instead of you know, and have a blood sugar in a normal range. So I think it really empowered the patients to take control of their disease process. Getting the doctors involved because I think there's no better word to a patient than a doctor recommending something. The next best is the nurse to recommend it and just playing it up of how beneficial it is and that they're going to take some control and that we  Courage that to all work together as a team to get the success and the benefit of what we want and the goal of that are controlled. Diabetes is a team effort. It's not just the patient. It's not just the doctor. It's not just the medications. It's everything, combined of a team effort. And I think the biggest thing for us getting people here was to have it at the office because people are comfortable here. They're not going to a strange place. They were, you know, excited to tell us things about the class after  The class ended for the day and it just worked having it here. If there were any questions, we were available to help with the instructors or with the patients.  Well, I don't see why anybody should have any misgivings. I mean.  Everybody needs help. Everybody needs education. It's a service that's free to the patient's. They come in and they learn and they benefit from it. And you know, it empowers them and what better way than to have everybody as a team help control. I don't know why anybody would be opposed to having somebody come and help educate their patients. Just would not make any sense.  Classes are taught by two trains leaders using the Stanford University.

The strong homology, seen in the insulin sequence of diverse species, suggests that it has been conserved across much of animal evolution.  Jewelry history. The c-peptide of proinsulin. However, differs much more among species. It is also a hormone but a secondary one. The primary structure of bovine insulin was first determined by Frederick Sanger in 1951. After that, this polypeptide was synthesized independently by several groups. The three-dimensional structure of insulin was determined by x-ray, crystallography in Dorothy Hodgkin laboratory in  89. Insulin is produced and stored in the body as a hexamer. While the active form is the monomer. The hexamer is an inactive form with long-term stability, which serves as a way to keep the highly reactive insulin protected yet readily available. The hexamer monomer conversion is one of the central aspects of insulin formulations for injection. The hexamer is far more stable than the monomer, which is desirable for practical reasons. However, the monomer is a much  Faster, reacting drug? Because diffusion rate is inversely related to particle size a fast. Reacting drug means insulin.

Insulin is produced in the pancreas and released, when any of several stimuli are detected, these stimuli include ingested, protein and glucose in the blood produced. From digested food. Carbohydrates can be Polymers of simple sugars or the simple sugars themselves, if the carbohydrates include glucose than that, glucose will be absorbed into the bloodstream and blood glucose level will begin to rise in target cells. Insulin initiates a  Transduction, which has the effect of increasing glucose uptake in storage. Finally, insulin is degraded terminating. The response in. Mammals. Insulin is synthesized in the pancreas within the I squared cells of the islets of langerhans. 1 million to 3 million islets of langerhans form. The endocrine part of the pancreas, which is primarily an exocrine gland. The endocrine portion accounts for only 2% of the total mass of the  Reyes with in the islets of langerhans, beta cells, constitute 65. 80 percent of all the cell's insulin, consists of two polypeptide chains the A and B chains linked together by disulfide bonds, it is however, first synthesized as a single polypeptide called pro pro insulin in pancreatic. I squared sells pre proinsulin contains a 24 residue signal peptide, which directs the nascent polypeptide chain to the rough.  Endoplasmic.

It's proinsulin undergoes maturation into active insulin, through the action of cellular endopeptidase has known as prohormone convert a sizes as well as the XO protease carboxypeptidase e. The Endo peptidases cleave at two positions, releasing a fragment called the c-peptide and leaving two peptide chains. The be and a chains linked by to disulfide bonds. The cleavage sites are each located after a pair of basic residues after  Cleavage of the c-peptide, these two pairs of basic residues are removed by the carbon Russia peptidase. The c-peptide is the central portion of proinsulin and the primary sequence of proinsulin goes in the order, BCA. The resulting mature, insulin is packaged inside.

The first phase release is rapidly, triggered in response to increased blood glucose.  The second phase is a sustained. Slow release of newly formed vesicles, triggered independently of sugar. The description of first phase release is as follows glucose enters the I squared cells through the glucose transporter GL, u t to glucose goes into glycolysis and the Krebs cycle where multiple high energy ATP molecules are produced by oxidation. Leading to a rise in the ATP ADP ratio within the cell.  An increased intracellular, ATP ADP, ratio closes, the ATP, sensitive s, you are once Kerr 6.2, potassium Channel.

Mmm, this allows the release of CO2 plus irons from the ER via IP 3 gated channels and further raises, the intracellular concentration of calcium. Ions, significantly increased amounts of calcium ions in the cells causes the release of previously synthesized insulin, which has been stored in secretory vesicles. This is the primary mechanism for release of insulin. Other substances known to stimulate insulin release, include the amino acids Arginine and leucine.  Sympathetic release of acetylcholine, sulfonylurea, cholecystokinin and the gastrointestinal lead arrived in cretins glucagon-like peptide 1 and glucose dependent insulin, a Tropic peptide, release of insulin is strongly inhibited by the stress hormone norepinephrine which leads to increased blood glucose levels during stress. It appears that release of catecholamines by the sympathetic nervous system has conflicting influences on insulin release by beta cells.  Because insulin release is inhibited by. I plus, or minus 2, adrenergic receptors and stimulated by I squared to adrenergic receptors, the net effect of norepinephrine from sympathetic, nerves and epinephrine from adrenal glands on insulin release is inhibition, due to dominance of the I plus or minus adrenergic receptors when the glucose level comes down to the usual physiologic value. Insulin release from the I squared cells, slows or stops if blood glucose levels,  Up lower than this.\",\n",

       " '_0FgUXVR8': \"If any time in the last decade your pick, you had a formal or an informal guideline on tight glycemic control in the care of a critically ill child, whether it's child with sepsis or child after cardiac surgery later in the program. We'll be asking what your current practice is. But I wonder. Now if you could leave a comment, as I said if in the last 10 years your program had a protocol for tight glycemic control at some point.  Aunt.  We're back. Dr. Agus. I wonder if we could begin by, if you could explain the biologic, rationale for tight glycemic control. Obviously, the audience is well aware of the long history of glucose, insulin potassium, infusions and critical illness, and the studies that have been going on for 50 years in that realm, but could you take us through the biologic? Rationale? Is it the avoidance of hyperglycemia, or is it the introduction of insulin?  Could we hear about that? And what motivated you for this study? You're right to say that. Glucose insulin, potassium, infusion or gik infusion has been around for a long time. In fact, starting in the 1960s, the medical Cardiology population, began to treat their post. Myocardial infarction patients with the gik infusion to try to determine if there were improved recovery times improved function after that event.  By the 1970s, the practice had shifted to cardiac surgery and had been published multiple times and lots of different studies. But the interesting thing about the field is that each study was a little bit different in terms of how they Define their population. What dose they use, how they perform the the protocol and really going into the 80s and 90s. There was no clear decision that all clinicians in the field had come too.  About whether this practice was worthwhile and the late 90s. There is a single review. It looked like there was a benefit and a couple years later. There was an equally prominent review or meta-analysis of the literature, the suggested that it had no benefits at all. That really, I think laid the backdrop of the use of insulin in a sick population. Now, the benefits that the groups were able to see when when  Were benefits were published in again, various different formats, but they certainly included membrane stabilization. Anti-arrhythmic, effects, improve, myocardial glycogen content post-operative, insulin resistance, when they moved in the cardiac surgical field, reduction of circulating, free fatty acid levels, which are known to have some degree of toxicity to the cardiac myocyte improve glucose utilization and then there were other benefits.  That seemed to be present terms of improved, cardiac index, improved immune function, the taking a step, back the in vitro or non-clinical studies. That looked at the benefits of insulin or the harm of hyperglycemia have also been very different and varied over the years. The the bulk of the immune benefits.  We're shown in in vitro studies or in animal studies. But all of the, all of the learnings that we've had over the years that remind us that hyperglycemia harms neutrophil function. Phagocytosis results in increased cytokine expression.  Basically, all of those in vitro studies were done at very high glucose concentrations, which made sense. That the question was always is a glucose of 300 400, 500 mg per deciliter harmful. And in what ways that it does it exert that negative effect by the same token. Insulin has been shown in various situations to have profound anti-inflammatory effects. And so the both the harm of hyperglycemia and  Benefits of hyperinsulinemia have been well established, what? Nobody had really gotten to yet. Going into the the turn of the Millennium was are there differences within the physiologic range where patients really live? Is there a difference between 80 110, 150 180 that had not been established at all. What had been established. Is that very high blood sugars?  Were associated with all sorts of in vitro damage and in fact, retrospectively in worst, patient, outcomes, but the clear definition of where to target within a particular population had had not been well established with that as the backdrop. Could we turn to the Vanderburgh study in 2001 adult, study our audiences. Well familiar with it, but  The hypothesis clearly turned at that point and we've been investigating it ever since. Could you take us through, take us through the meaning of that study and how thinking about tight glycemic control? Evolved was a very interesting time in when the study came out in 2001, but what's fascinating is that there were a couple key studies that came out just before hand and in 1995 in particular was a study called tegami diabetes.  Insulin and glucose after myocardial infarction, which kind of was naturally led to buy the history of gik infusions. What they did is took a group of several hundred adults after myocardial infarction and tightly control, their blood sugar just for the period of inpatient hospitalization, which was roughly a couple of days with only a couple of days of glucose control. However, one year later, there was a 29 percent reduction in mortality.  In the group that had tight glucose control. There was some emphasis placed on outpatient management after the inpatient insulin infusion. But but by all accounts, it was very minimal and really it's this two-day period of tight glucose control. That resulted in an incredible mortality benefit a year later. That was really the end of the, the gik era and moving into targeted.  Goes control, where you actually brought the glucose into the physiologic range. Great, Vandenberg followed took the field, really, a step further by designing, a trial that at its outset actually was not a glucose control trial. Interestingly. She's an endocrinologist and intensivist as well. And identified igf bp1 insulin-like growth factor binding protein, 1 as a predictor of patients who went on to  To be nonsurvivors in the ICU. If I just be P1 with elevated, that give you a significant increase in mortality risk during your subsequent hospitalization. Igp, one is constitutively produced by the liver and suppressed by insulin effect. And so dr. Vandenburg sought to design a trial to reduce. I gfb P1 and thereby confer survival benefit to the patients in the trial. The way to do that, is with insulin.  The way to do it responsibly and with very clear parameters is with a tight glucose control regimen. And so that's how this study was actually designed not not primarily for glucose control, but for igf bp1 suppression, the trial was incredibly successful in terms of demonstrating a reduction in mortality. It's true that the bulk of those were surgical patients and the bulk of the surgical, or cardiac Surgical and the bulk of  of the, those who got benefit were exposed to therapy for an extended period of time. Those are all important lessons for subsequent trials, that were to be defined as a PostScript. The igf bp1 was actually not suppressed in survivors as had been hypothesized, but we certainly ended up with a very impressive findings with tight glucose control, bit less formal. The study was underway at the same time by a cardiac surgeon.  Tony furnari who noticed that his diabetes patients had a doubling of mortality compared to his nine. Diabetes patients for the same operation. Same operator, and he simply came to the conclusion that they needed to have glucose better controlled and began to do so. And so in a cohort kind of way, demonstrated a reduction in mortality in his own patients over the course of a decade by 50%, these two studies.  Really stood out as the turning the tide among intensivists. Who, in my opinion, always felt a little bit guilty for allowing biochemical parameter to drift completely out of range during the critical illness course. And as long as that wasn't harming, the patient people, Let It Go, but once it became clear that controlling it potentially conferred, significant benefit. Really the entire world. I jumped on that bandwagon.  And in my own institution. At the time I was training at Mass General, we considered repeating the trial initially in adults, just to confirm that there was such dramatic benefit. But by the time, the trial got fully designed. Even at that hospital tight glucose control. Had essentially been adopted if only informally eventually formally by that and the  Early of adult units around this country and I suspect around the world. Like what if we could pause at this point and ask our colleagues around the world. Could you first tell us what city and Country you're in? And secondly, could you tell us did your picu program change practice in response to the Vanderburgh study in 2001? And in particular, did you adopt a tight glycemic control protocol formally or informally in the care of critically ill children?  And in response to that study.\",\n",

And the point is that you can't go anywhere these days without someone telling you, how you might be able to become thinner. And yeah, partially, it's because it's a really good way to sell people things because we're very conscious about our bodies, but it's also because Americans these days are getting fat and not just fat, but obese, and it's happening, really, really fast. And this is a map of the United States.  In 1980. Because that's when the cdc's started collecting data on Obesity. It was about it, ten percent and as time goes on things start to get a little scary and the whole country. But mostly focusing, Mississippi. What is Mississippi doing? Stop doing that? You can see suddenly last 30 years. A lot of America has an average obesity rate above 30%.

We have 7 billion people on the Earth right now and a lot of people studying this think that 2.3 billion of them will be obese by 2015. Dang. That is a lot of obese people. And to be clear here, doctors, don't go around hollering about how we need to lose weight because they're being paid off by the health foods industry. It's actually really bad for us carrying around a lot of extra body weight can kill you, and many unpleasant ways, including our two.  Ways to Die, heart disease and cancer, but also the new epidemic of type 2 diabetes. So being that it is objectively bad for you, but the question remains, how did it happen so quickly and why did it happen so quickly. So what's going on? Because the data on to be City would suggest that we're all just sitting around eating pork cracklins all day. Matt, I think was a very first for crack when I've ever eaten my life and I can tell you why.  Why do people eat these? That's not food and it's not just certain groups of people. It's everybody. It's a little kids and it's old people and its rich people and it's poor people and it's new immigrants to America. And its people whose ancestors came over, on the Mayflower, conventional wisdom, and scientific rationality tells us that this is a numbers game. It's calories in versus calories out. It's the first friggin law thermodynamics. People are doctors, never shut up about having us eat, right? And exercise and they're basically right if we  That we should be able to maintain a normal healthy body shape. Whereas, a quick perusal of the contents of your average grocery store will tell you that we do not eat right? And a quick examination of the way that I, for example of my life. I would indicate that we don't, you don't exercise very often. I love to sit, but doctors are now pretty sure that. In fact, it's not just diet and exercise, there has to be some other reason why America and the rest of the world is having this crazy.  A obesity epidemic because scientists have doctors have been setting out again. And again, to prove that it's just an exercise. Every time they come back and they pretty much fail, for example, in the year 2000. They took 1700 schoolchildren from 40 different schools and they divided them into groups. It's kind of cruel thing to do, but the did it and they gave one of the group's better, physical education and a better diet. And they gave the other group less physical, education, and worse. And, and the same old diet, not a worse diet, but the one that they had always been eating, which if you remember, school lunch, not good.  I think the three years of that, some of the smartest people in the world armed, with the best research equipment that you could buy millions of dollars and lots of free time, couldn't find a difference in the body mass index of those, two groups of kids. So, researchers are Now setting their sights at overall macro changes in the way that humans are living and even changes to our genes that may be defining why we are so obese now. And maybe we don't have to blame ourselves anymore. First, reason not enough sleep. It's hard to get.  Precise data on how long people sleep at night, but our best guess is that since the 1960s we've lost about two hours of sleep per night. We're just we're just very busy people and there are a bunch of studies that show that as you sleep less, your body mass index goes up, which is why I like to sleep, like, like 10 or 12 hours a day. And this is kind of hard data to figure out because obesity actually leads to sleep disorders. And so obese, people have a harder time sleeping and so it's harder.  About whether the lack of sleep is leading to the Obesity of the Obesity is leaving the lack of sleep, but scientist actually did a pretty good job of figuring out that sleep deprivation actually causes obesity and they figured out one mechanism at least as to. Why, for example, there's a hormone called leptin and there's another one, which I'll just put up here because I don't know how to pronounce it. And when you're sleep deprived, those hormones get all out of whack and they start to tell your body that you're hungry. When what in fact probably need is not food but sleep reason, number two, climate control, so there's doesn't immediately make  Us. But we are warm-blooded mammals. We have to expend energy to keep our bodies at the temperature at, which they can exist. And if our body is good too hot, then we die. And if it get too cold, then we die and the past 30 years. Our indoor spaces have become more and more exactly what we want them to be. We have really good climate control systems. Now, it's warm inside when it's cold outside, and it's cold inside when it's warm outside and don't get me wrong. I'm not going to argue into this. I love that. I I love coming home and having it.  Not be 30 degrees inside, but it does. In fact, take a huge amount of our calories to keep our bodies at the optimal temperature, and we're simply not expending those calories anymore, because it's always 72 degrees inside. Reason number three. We all quit smoking to be clear. Cigarettes are much more deadly than obesity facts is facts. People, nicotine is an appetite suppressant. So if you smoke you eat less and even worse, if you smoke in, then you stop, you eat more. I've also in the same vein, heard that man.  With is a really great weight loss strategy, especially because you lose your teeth and hair and and those things have mass. So you know, that's that's that's good. I'm tap what I'm saying here is don't start smoking. Also don't do math. Thank you Crystal Meth. Number three reason that we're all getting fatter industrial chemicals every day you and I and everyone else in America is exposed to thousands of industrial chemicals. Resin solvents, perfumes die.  Is all that lovely, weird stuff that they put in chicken nuggets. We swallow them. We inhale them, they absorb through. Our skin researchers, for example, are working with these poor. Chubby little rats, exposing them to hexa chlorobenzene, which is an industrial pesticide and the Rats that are exposed to hex chlorobenzene are significantly faster than rats that aren't even when you feed the hexa chlorobenzene rats. Half as much food. As the control rats, that is unfortunate. Another reason why we may be getting fatter your mom. So your chances of getting fat, unfortunately.  Maybe set even before you are born first because overweight women tend to choose overweight men to Father their offspring and then you end up with two sets of overweight, genes overlapping in your chromosomes. Also, women who are overweight during pregnancy or who contract gestational diabetes, tend to give birth to babies, who will later in life, become obese, and your chances of being obese later in life are also affected by how old your mom was when she gave birth to you. The average.  Of a first-time mother. Jumped from 21 in 1972. 25 in the year 2000 and some Studies have come up with weird figures about this like for every five years a woman waits to have a baby. That baby is 14 percent, more likely to become obese. And now is the part where I explain to you why this is except no one has any idea and the final contender in the your mom category, your mom, you can blame her for pretty much everything now is epigenetics and we've done a whole episode on epigenetics and you can  Click over here to go to that episode and you'll learn all about all the things that your parents did to you before you were born. So you should watch that episode because it's totally going to make it be like, what basically we used to think that your genes were your jeans, but it turns out that there's a bunch of information that's above the genome, which is what epigenetics mean above genetics and that epigenetic information can be created just one generation before you and totally change the way that your genome is expressed. So basically the way that your mom ate food and whether she Smoked Cigarettes,  How stressed out she was can all affect your chances of becoming an obese person. And finally, our last reason why people are obese got bacteria, the bacteria in our bodies are fantastic and we like to think of ourselves as big independent individuals. But actually, we're symbiotic ecosystem up in here. They're actually more bacterial cells in our body than there are us cells. That's weird. Huh? So the bacteria in our gut are super fantastic, really great hard-working. Little guy.  Guys and they help us metabolize food. They help us create certain types of vitamins and it turns out that skinny people tend to have more gut bacteria and more different types of gut bacteria than obese, people. I mean the question is, what do we do about that? I mean, it's not like you could take a healthy person's gut, bacteria and put them.  Actually, maybe you can do that and it's really simple to do. It's just kind of hard to get people to agree to it. It's called a fecal transplant and it's exactly what it sounds like. So yeah, you take healthy gut bacteria, extracted from a healthy person's poop and you just insert it into unhealthy, ecosystem of gut bacteria and it works and it can solve all sorts of weird problems from like,  Bad intestinal infections to potentially, actually helping people with obesity. So in conclusion, skinny, Hank, weight loss peanut sauce is not going to help you, but we do now have a prescription for weight loss for you. Number one, get more sleep. Number to have your mom give birth to you and she's a little bit younger. Number three. See what you can do about before you're born. Making sure that your mom doesn't smoke doesn't eat too much and gets with skinny, your guys know.  Before do not heat or cool your house and think of all the money you'll save on utilities. And finally, number five moved to a different planet that isn't laced with industrial chemicals. And yes, it's also probably a good idea to eat better and exercise more.

       " 'go6TXqQKMg': \"Really violently sick and vomiting vomiting vomiting, and eventually it settled down. And I was able to push an IV Zofran through my port to help with the nausea, but it did not work. I was just so severe that vomiting spell and eventually I managed to go back to sleep, but I was up again around one and then again around three and that third time Jed had come home from work, and he pushed and ID's do Fran for me because I couldn't and get up off the floor, and  finally, after that, I was able to go to sleep for the night and  and that is gastroparesis for you. Sometimes it's really hard. I have like these nightly vomiting episodes like two or three times a week, but last night was way more severe than usual.  And I did not even eat a thing yesterday. I had a few sips of water. So  Sometimes you can do everything right, but everything can still go wrong because chronic illness isn't always Fair. Sorry. I'm just feeling pretty, pretty terrible. So I'm going to try and get my nausea here under control, a little more and then go back to bed feeling a little bit more alive. Part of my treatment for gastroparesis is doing infusions three times a week. Originally, the infusions were started.  Only for my postural orthostatic, tachycardia syndrome to increase blood volume and help with fainting and things like that. But when my GP got a lot worse, we started mixing one of my infusion bags and two banana bags and that's extra vitamins and nutrients and minerals to help supplement. Whatever my feeding tube formula doesn't give me and the fluids themselves. Help a lot with the dehydration that comes with all the vomiting from my GP and so because of the infusions and other things like IV, zofran and anti-nausea,  Asia Med, I can administer through my port intravenously. We can manage my gastroparesis more at home. Now. I used to have to go to the hospital. But now most of the time we can handle it at home and for that I'm really thankful. All right, I questioned IV Zofran started my saline infusion. When that infusion bags done. I will do my banana bag. And now I'm going to take care of my feet into my feeding tube pump is actually off and I didn't get much nutrition last night at all. That's because when I'm having a lot of  Jen vomiting, the seeds can make it worse. So I had to turn it off to give myself a break, but hopefully when the Zofran really kicks in, then I can start it up at least a low rate, but I still need to flush my feeding tube. So I'm going to do that now.  By the way, when I'm like this Harlow was always very close to me. You're like my furry shadow.  Hi, made it downstairs. And if you're wondering why I'm on the floor. This is why she gets really clingy and concerned when I'm not doing what I'm doing extra poorly. So I love my dog. Anyways, I called my doctor and we think a big problem is that I'm not tolerating my feeds anymore. I'm eating this formula just doesn't work. Well for my body anymore. And when I first got my feeding tube about two and a half months ago. The hospital was very particular about what formula they  Me on. And this was the best option at the time. But I've been doing some research and there's other types of formulas, that aren't really offered every where only certain Distributors have access to it. And some of them are like, completely organic. No, added preservatives, really, wholesome ingredients. And this formula does give me a complete nutritious diet, but some formulas are better than others and some will be better for my body than others. So, I was talking to my doctor about switching and he's open to it, but he wants us both to do a little more research, which I'm totally okay with  with it's just that I haven't been able to maintain my gold rate of 35 ml an hour. And since I don't really do any oral intake at all. I'm not getting enough nutrition and that's not good. But if I try and bump up my rate to my goal, right, I just get unbearable symptoms of cramping and nausea and vomiting, and it's just, it's not good. The other thing is, well, if you're new here, I have a j tube feeding tube. So it completely skips my stomach and goes to my jejunum for nutrition. Because of my GP, my  I'll make is the most problematic part of my digestive tract. It just is partially paralyzed and it just doesn't digest anything while Link at all. And this feeding tube doesn't have a g Port. The new feeding to I'm getting is a GJ button. It'll have the J port for nutrition and a.g. Port to my stomach to allow me to vent and drain contents under just sitting there because my stomach can't digest it and it doesn't matter if I eat or not because even if I donate there's a lot of like pressure build-up and bile and acid that my stomach can't handle it either. So that venting and draining option.  Is going to be a really good tool in my treatment and they found out, they can overnight the GJ button and the ordering a few different sizes. So I leave with the right fit and they got me in to change it on the 18th. And that's a lot sooner than we expected. But everyone feels so bad about what happened. They're working really hard to fix it, which is okay with me. And I'm also on top of them, a bit. So between changing my formula and getting the new feeding tube. I think we'll be able to better manage my symptoms. Well, I managed to  At my rate up to 15 mL an hour, but that's even making my nausea worse, but I need to get some nutrition and and I have no idea if I'll be able to eat. Maybe I'll feel better later today. Who knows? But I've decided, since I'm having such trouble eating, I'll make something that's really easy for me to eat, which is chicken noodle soup. So doing it in the slow cooker. I don't have a recipe. It's just a bunch of stuff. I throw it together, but it should taste good. Oh, I am gonna  Why on this couch and relax? Probably go back to sleep because I didn't sleep much at all. Last night Harlow, get the blanket.  Good girl.  Got it.  What are you doing in choosing? Which one?  Since Doug, get it hard. Get it.  Get it.  Oh, strong dog. Thank you for making me laugh. Go on. Thanks Harlow. Good girl.  Good girl. Well, I've been resting. I actually fell asleep on the couch for a very long time. Judd didn't even wake me up when he went to work. He knew I had a terrible night. So the rest was much needed. Judd is at work, by the way, he's back on 12-hour shifts, which we love. He's in the next part of his training where he is on the road with an experienced officer learning how to patrol, and he's a law enforcement officer in case through our new or wondering. And so some days, he's working some days.  Not some days. He'll be in the Vlog, some days. He won't, I made him spaghetti to eat when he gets home and I have shredded up my chicken for my soup. I also cut up some noodles from drugs spaghetti. He does not like soup at all. So that's why I made him another meal, but I like so hoping I'll feel well enough to eat it soon. I honestly feel like I need to sleep more, so I'm going to. But first, I need to mix up my banana bag because  It is time.  Tada, my banana bag is all ready to go. So these little vials have all of the extra nutrients I need and I just got to connect the tubing, hook it up to the pump and I'll be infusing.  Hooked up to my banana bag and with my feeds I've been able to bump it up to 20 ml an hour while I went from 15 to 18 then 220. It's not feeling good. But it's at least somewhat tolerable and I'm not vomiting anymore. So all of that is a reason to be thankful. I'm definitely going to keep resting now though. I just woke up from a nap and I was like, it's nighttime. What year is it? You know when you wake up from a nap and you're really disoriented. I mean, it's not really  Nighttime, it's just it was dark enough that I have to turn on a light and what woke me up was my infusion. Pump going off saying my infusion finish. So I was asleep for a while. But now I have got to get up and check on my soup, but most importantly feed. The dog. Are you hungry? I'm so sorry. Well, I mean, it's not that late past in her time, but I will feed you now, Marlo is enjoying her dinner and the soup looks and smells pretty good. I only made a little bit.  Because I'm going to be the only one eating this, John doesn't like soup. And this is obviously not Harlow's food. And thankfully. I feel like I can have a small bowl of it. I was gonna sit on the couch but someone had a different idea. Sorry. I will stay down here with you Harlow. And got my soup here. It's did you see her nose pop up. It's not for you. I have the smallest amount. I'm going to take a quick bite.  It tastes good, but I don't want to push it. So I'm going to see how that b goes. And this is my typical day with gastroparesis not eating or not eating much at all. Not knowing if the safe food from one day is going to trigger me the next day, nausea, vomiting bloating stomach pain, but at the same time fighting all of that with infusions and IV medications and a feeding tube. And the determination to know that even though I had a really particularly hard day with my GP, I can keep moving forward and right now I'm just celebrating.  Fact that not one bite has gone. Well, I mean, it's kind of early to tell but fingers crossed. Uh-huh. I was able to eat it. That is a huge thing to celebrate. I'm so thankful right now. For that. I'm not feeling great from eating that but it's tolerable. So I'm hoping tonight will be an easier night last night and kind of fitting that I showed you all typical day of what it's like to have gastroparesis during gastroparesis awareness month. That is August.  It's GP awareness month. So I'm going to do my best to advocate for gastroparesis this month and every month, of course, like I do for all my chronic illnesses and just chronic illness in general. Well, Harlow, and I have moved our snuggle session to the bed and I am just getting my new feeding bag with the new nutrition in. I change it every 24 hours I do before bed and there's\",\n",
       " 'vhF1aEOaIzw': \"Hey guys, dr. Axe here a question. I got recently from a patient was, is cranberry juice, good for you? And my answer is the benefits of cranberry juice. Can be absolutely amazing. If you're buying the right type of cranberry juice. And this video. I'm going to talk to you about the many benefits of cranberry juice and what type of cranberry juice you should take, and what type you should absolutely stay away from. So, let's start talking about the many benefits of cranberry juice. So cranberry juice contains. The reason, Beneficial is cranberries on the orac score chart, which is the antioxidant ranking. They scored nearly 10,000 that's five times more antioxidants than spinach and five times more than most other fruits. So first off you can see that it is loaded with went antioxidants. One of those phytonutrients in cranberries is called anthocyanins and it has antimicrobial properties. So, one of the things that you can use cranberry juice and treating is urinary tract,  So again, if you have a UTI cranberry juice, has many benefits as in, a great is a great natural treatment. In fact, when I have patients who have UTIs, I have them, get off all sugar and just take cranberry extract or cranberry juice along with vegetables for several days, and it completely helps eliminate those UTI infection. So, again, one of the main benefits, they're also one of the many benefits of cranberries is because of the antioxidants. It's a powerful.  Cancer fighter and we know that most berries, including blueberries and cranberries both because of those antioxidants can help fight cancer. Another great benefits of cranberry is that they really specifically support the kidneys and the bladder and in Chinese medicine, the kidneys are there along with the adrenal glands to help your body, better deal with stress. So if you're under emotional stress on a regular basis, whether it's relational stress, workplace, stress or something else going on.  On in your life, to our, you know, you're stressed out. Cranberry juice specifically is fantastic for helping your body deal with stress because it improves circulation. And, again, your kidneys are part of your body that help deal with stress. And so again, if you tend to be a dramatic person, or again, engaged in any type of stress drinking cranberry juice on a regular basis can help combat those issues. Also, cranberry juice, is fantastic. For your liver. When you taste that sort of sourness of the  Cranberry juice, that's nourishing to your liver. So it supports detoxification, another great benefit, their of cranberry juice. Now, here's a sort of cranberry juice. As I mentioned earlier, question. I get all the time is cranberry juice. Good for you. Well, it depends. Here's the cranberry juice. You want to stay away from if there is any added sugar and that goes for dried cranberries or cranberry juice both? But if there's any added sugar, stay away from it, the type of cranberry juice. You one is ideally, you'd buy.  The Cranberries whole and Juice them yourself. If not just straight cranberry juice and ideally unpasteurized, or low temperature pressed. But again, cranberry juice has tremendous health benefits. It can be used to cleanse. Your urinary tract, cleanse your kidney, support your adrenal Grill, and support your liver. You can see. It is one of the world's healthiest foods, but again, you want to stay away from any with added sugar and I, you know, we I have actually several great.  Re recipes on my website. If you simply go to dr. Axe.com that's dra x.com. You're going to find a lot of cramps are several cranberry recipes on there. I know it's popular during Thanksgiving but hey, you can use it.

       " 'IrkurR446s': \"This part right here is known as the cornea, and it is where light initially passes through, as it goes through the eye. And then it hits this structure right here, which is known as the lens, and the lens focuses the light on this structure in the back of the eye, this kind of brownish structure. And this is the retina and then exiting the back of the eye here. This is the optic nerve. Then you can also see all of these blood vessels that are traveling through the retina, and then exit, the back of the eye.  In the middle of the optic nerve. So if you look over here on the right, this is a front view of the eye. So this is kind of what it looks like when a doctor looks into your eye. So here, right here. We have, What's called the optic disc and the optic disc is really just the convergence of the retina and where it exits, the I. So this is really actually the optic nerve exiting the back of the eye. And then over here. You have a structure called the fovea.  And the fovea is the portion of the retina with the highest density of cones, which are the nervous receptors that correspond with color and more high-resolution. So this is the portion of the retina that produces the highest resolution image. So in a sense you can kind of think of the fovea is producing an HD or a high-definition quality image. Whereas kind of the more periphery of the retina on the outside, will produce a much lower quality image. Now that we have a very basic General orientation to the  In the retina, let's use this drawing to discuss the three stages of diabetic retinopathy and they are diabetes, without retinopathy non or pre proliferative diabetic, retinopathy and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. And one thing that's important to note is that these stages of diabetic retinopathy, are defined by their pathology, not by the clinical presentation or their symptoms. But before we dive into the pathology here, what are some of the common symptoms of diabetic? Retinopathy?  Well, since it's a disease of the retina caused by diabetes, it makes sense that the symptoms are typically Visual and most of the symptoms tend to be fairly mild. Initially. They are things like blurry vision or seeing dark spots or floaters. However, sometimes the symptoms can be very serious such as sudden onset of blindness. All right. So now let's get back to these stages of diabetic retinopathy. So the first stage I mentioned is diabetes without retinopathy. So why do we consider diabetes without  Apathy a stage of diabetic retinopathy. It doesn't quite make sense. And this is because the stages are dictated by the underlying pathology. And so long before someone with diabetes, develops Vision State changes, the underlying hyperglycemia or high blood sugar levels in their blood causes damage to cells known as parasites within the retina. So these retinal pericytes are specialized contractile cells that surround, the retinal vasculature here and they're very important for helping.  Upping regulate blood flow throughout the retina and the damage to these parasites is believed to be caused by in an inability to properly metabolize the glucose within these cells and then this results in osmotic damage. Now, this damage to the retinal pericytes is the earliest stage of diabetic retinopathy, and it's likely present in many. If not most individuals with diabetes who have had diabetes for at least a few years. However, unfortunately, this damage is only detectable under a microscope.  And therefore, the retina on optimal logic or on an eye exam, looks normal. It looks something like this. So therefore early in the course of diabetes individuals will not necessarily have visual disturbances or signs of disease on exam. However, this does not necessarily mean that the damage is not occurring. It's just not detectable. And the next stage of diabetic retinopathy. Is that of the non or pre proliferative diabetic, retinopathy.  Kathy, so recall that I just mentioned that these retinal pericytes help regulate blood flow through the vessels throughout the retina and when they're damaged, this results in a weakening of the capillary walls as well as increased blood flow. What happens when these capillaries are damaged, it allows for the formation of microaneurysms, which are focal dilations of weakened vessel walls, and since these aneurysms occur in the micro vasculature of the retina.  Vessels themselves are very small and not visible on Optima logic exam. However, the Micra and aneurysms are. And so, they kind of look like these red dots that just appear kind of randomly throughout the retina. And if we bring in an actual picture here of the retina, you can see that this is actually what they look like under examination. So, they're a little bit hard to see, but they're these dots right here, right here. And here, which are typically the first clinical sign of diabetic, retinopathy.  Retinopathy. However, this isn't the only clinical finding for this non or pre proliferative diabetic retinopathy stage in addition to damaging the retinal. Capillaries this loss, or damage to the retinal pericytes, also results in increased, vascular permeability. And basically what this means is that the capillaries become leaky. Now, this leakiness allows for large molecules such as proteins and lipids, that are normally retained within the vessels to leak out.  Into this retinal tissue. And unfortunately, there isn't a normal mechanism to allow these to be reabsorbed. So as you can imagine, if proteins and lipids were to leak out, they get trapped and this also can be seen under a dilated eye exam. And it kind of appears as these yellow white flecks on the retina as you can see here and this finding is known as a hard exudate. And once again, even though this is just a drawing of the  Anna. It's actually fairly representative of what actual hard exudates look like. So you can see. Once again, all of these microhemorrhages are the microaneurysms and the retina and then these white yellow Flex all over, and that's the proteins and lipids that have leaked out to form these hard exudates in the retina. So these two clinical findings are very characteristic of this second stage or the non or pre proliferative stage of diabetic retinopathy.  And because diabetic retinopathy is categorized by the pathologic findings and not necessarily the clinical presentation. This stage of diabetic retinopathy may or may not be symptomatic. So it usually begins about 15 to 25 years after someone's initially diagnosed with diabetes and it can last for many years before it progresses to the next stage, which is proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Now proliferative diabetic, retinopathy can be a  Maduk, however, it's pretty uncommon. So most individuals that reach this stage of diabetic retinopathy usually will have at least blurry vision or the presence of floaters. And as its name, suggests proliferative diabetic, retinopathy is characterized by vascular proliferation within the retina. And the reason for this is that all of the micro, vascular damage that occurs in these first two stages of diabetic retinopathy results in something called. Ischemia. And what ischemia is, is a lack of  Of oxygen supply to the cells of the retina. So, with the retina will do, is it tries to compensate for this ischemia by producing a growth factor known as vegf, which stands for vascular endothelial growth factor, and vegf, does exactly what its name suggests. It produces new blood vessels. However, these blood vessels in diabetic, retinopathy are abnormal and the retina is not able to compensate.  For the ischemia, so it looks something like this over time. So you can see there's all of these new blood vessels that have formed within the retina and similar to the microaneurysms in the hard exudates. This vascular proliferation can also be identified on a dilated eye exam and it looks something like this. So you can see some maybe a little bit more normal large vessels in the retina, but then throughout here are these a little bit lighter, kind of squiggly looking.  Newer vessels. So this is that vascular proliferation that is indicative of the proliferative diabetic retinopathy. And unfortunately, once diabetic retinopathy hits, this third stage and becomes proliferative, the clinical course is pretty unpredictable and it can actually be fairly severe resulting in potentially Vision threatening complications such as vitreous Hemorrhage or retinal detachment.  So, now that we have a better understanding of the pathological mechanisms of diabetic, retinopathy, how can we use this information to learn how the condition is treated? Well, first off, the treatments are aimed at halting the underlying pathologic mechanisms of diabetic retinopathy. However, their use is more commonly dictated by the severity of symptoms. So, we'll start with the first stage, the diabetes, without retinopathy and since the pathologic mechanism of diabetic retinopathy is directly related to the underlying  Hyperglycemia associated with diabetes. The best way to prevent or delay. The progression of diabetic retinopathy is early and aggressive control of one's blood sugar with lifestyle modifications in anti-diabetic medications. However, often times, this is not enough and overtime, even individuals with very well, controlled diabetes, May develop diabetic retinopathy. So because these early stages are often asymptomatic, it's also important for all individuals with diabetes to have  A yearly dilated eye exam performed by an ophthalmologist to look for the signs of diabetic retinopathy. Now once an individual has a signs of diabetic, retinopathy such as the microhemorrhages, or the microaneurysms, and these hard exudates and they move into that second stage of diabetic retinopathy. And now the treatment is dependent on symptoms. So if that individual is say asymptomatic, their only treatment is still to just maintain proper blood glucose regulation.  And the yearly eye exam. However, as soon as symptoms such as blurry vision or floaters, develop, then an individual with diabetic, retinopathy should be placed on anti-vegf medications, and these medications will prevent the proliferation of new blood vessels in the retina and therefore help prevent the progression to proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Now, unfortunately, once someone has evidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, with this vascular proliferation of the  Retina, the clinical course is actually pretty difficult to.\",\n",

       " 'LOKMjHEyhY': \"Exercises that uses only the weight of your body as resistance are known as calisthenics and just as any other resistance training, the golden performing calisthenics is to promote muscle growth and strength originating from the Greek words Calo which means Beauty and stenos. Which means strength calisthenics, Rose into prominence in the 19th century by the father of gymnastics freeway gluing John. And fitting enough. There's nothing really that easy better embodiment of beauty and strength than gymnastics since calisthenics uses your body's weight as resistance. It's also known as body.  D weight exercises. And the big question about bodyweight exercises is how effective it is for building muscle and strength. Or if it's as effective as lifting weights to understand this, we need to understand how muscles grow and get stronger, muscular and strength adaptation occurs, when a stimulus or resistance is applied to the corresponding muscle at a high enough intensity to invoke muscle overload. Simply put the more weight you move with your muscles, the more your muscles adapt and become bigger and stronger, but it doesn't mean that any type of weight movement will work take jogging, for example, although it can be very taxing on the  Heart muscles and promote cardiac muscle growth. It will not promote much skeletal muscle growth, not even in your legs. The problem here is that the stimulus is not strong enough to Target all the legs muscle fibers. If you watch the muscle fibers video, before you understand that we have three different muscle fiber types. One of which is used for endurance, known as type 1. And the other two are used to provide great amounts of force known as type 2 fibers. Since running doesn't require large amounts of force from your legs type. 2 fibers are hardly fatigue and not a lot of muscle growth occurs. It's also the reason why many do not consider jogging as the  Calisthenics exercise even though it only utilizes your body's weight, but other calisthenics exercises do. In fact it listed High Enough of a demand to hit those large muscle fibers. Take a pull up. For example, where on average people can hardly even do 5, the movement demands. All fiber types too far, and eventually exhaust. Thus, promoting muscle growth. Push-ups are another good example of a calisthenics exercise that can enlist in muscle growth, especially for beginners that struggle to do even 10, but eventually you will run into the problem of not having enough resistance, as tough as it may be to get your first ten push-ups.  Eventually 10 would be just an easy warm-up when you start hitting 20, 25 or 30 push-ups easily. Then we run into the same problem as we saw with jogging. Of course, you can definitely modify the push-up to make a tougher such as elevating, your feet on a platform But ultimately you're not changing the amount of Demand on the muscle groups involved in a standard push-up. Instead you begin Shifting the muscles involved in the movement with feet elevated. Push-ups, your anterior shoulders, begin taking the brunt of the resistance instead of your chest. So you wanted to build your chest, you won't have enough resistance. And you might  Be thinking why not just add some weight on your back while at that point. It's no longer just bodyweight. Thus no longer calisthenics. The next natural progression is using weights, as great as calisthenics can be, there will be a point where certain muscle groups, especially the strong muscle groups, such as your chest, legs, and hips will eventually need greater resistance. Also, since calisthenics require you using multiple muscle groups to perform an exercise, which isn't a bad thing at all in terms of natural and functional development, but it does make it tough to isolate certain muscles. Now, that's not to say that calisthenics cannot build an aesthetically it.  Lean body after all you have guys looking like this from performing just bodyweight exercises, but when you compare them to this, there's a clear difference in muscle growth between the two regiments. Heck, even Olympic gymnast have to use weights to push their maximum potential. This is not to say that calisthenics has no place in anyone's exercise program. You just have to understand. Its uses. The great thing about calisthenics is that it's absolutely free. All you got to have is the ground you walk on any park with bars. The only time you have to spend money is from buying things like, suspension systems, or gymnastic rings.  It's for beginners bodyweight exercises. Will provide all the necessary compound movements that are usually found in a beginner program. And doesn't require you to motivate yourself to go to the gym. So if you do calisthenics and you like results, stick with it, if you feel like you're starting to hit a wall, then it's time to move up to weights.

       " 'ujm4opryN8': \"Hey guys, welcome to episode 7 of the strength series. These episodes are about gaining muscle and cutting fat specifically for guys. In this episode. I'm going to talk about how to increase your insulin sensitivity. In the last episode. I talked about insulin resistance. If your insulin resistant, you're more likely to store any carbohydrates you eat as fat when you eat carbohydrates or a large portion of protein that gets broken down and glucose is released into the bloodstream. Your body needs to deal with that. So, Your pancreas is going to release insulin, you have receptors in your muscle and fat cells and they're going to activate in the presence of insulin and they're going to draw the glucose out of the bloodstream. When you are having a sugary Foods or you're snacking throughout the day, you're triggering lots of these blood sugar spikes and that's going to release insulin every single time. Eventually your receptors become less responsive to insulin. So your pancreas needs to release more to do with the same amount of glucose.  If your insulin resistant, you release five to seven times as much insulin as a regular person. Would why is that a problem? Well, that's a problem, because in the presence of any insulin, all fat, burning hormones, are shut down. When you eat carbohydrates, your body is switching off fat burning mode, in order to deal with the food that you just ate. Your goal is to be more sensitive to insulin. Because we're talking about those receptors in your body. Are you want them to jump into action at the  Smallest release of insulin. So that is true. Whether you're trying to gain muscle or lose fat, that's because as well as keeping you burning fat by controlling your insulin, you can also help build muscle more effectively. So, with that in mind, here are 15 ways to increase your insulin sensitivity. Starting today. Number one, stop eating six times a day. It's fine. If you're having a moderate dose of protein and maybe some healthy fats, but if you're having a banana mid morning, then insulin is being released to avoid  Sugary drinks around half of the sugar in things, like Coke and Pepsi, as well as sports drinks is fructose. That is a fruit sugar and can only be dealt with by the liver into higher dose. It will interfere with insulin signaling and cause fat storage three limit your fruits. As I said, we want to manage fructose in order to improve your insulin sensitivity. It's a good idea to cut down on high-fructose fruits, like bananas and apples as well as most dried fruits, a limit of 12 pieces a day.  Is said to be effective for avoid sweeteners, just because there's zero calories, doesn't mean they can't trigger incident. This study showed a 20% increase in insulin, when someone consumed a drink with artificial sweeteners in it compared to water when taken with the meal. So it's best to stick with water and avoid diet, drinks particulate meal times 5, reduce your body fat. This is particularly true. If you're obese, as you're likely already, storing the carbs that you eat as body fat, if you follow a lower.  Carb diet, you should be able to bring your body fat percentage down to a healthy range. If you are 25 percent body fat or above, you can follow a diet of 50 grams or less of carbohydrate a day in order to lose weight. If you're carrying a bit of extra weight, you could limit your carbs to 150 or 200 grams. And also make sure to put them either. At breakfast time or around your workout six, exercise muscle consumes the majority of the glucose in your blood. So during intense exercise like weightlifting.  Or high intensity interval training is a very effective way of improving, sensitivity, Charles poliquin said that if you increase muscle mass by 10%, you can expect to improve the way that you handle your carbohydrates by around 11% 7, get enough sleep Studies have shown that a single night of poor sleep can contribute to insulin resistance, 8, increase your fiber intake. This will slow down digestion, and the release of sugar into the bloodstream from the gut, and the best sources of fiber are vegetables, nine.  A trans fats. Trans fats are used to extend shelf life and can be found in certain biscuits, Cakes and Pastries. They move your insulin sensitivity in the wrong direction and will promote belly fat, 10 improve your Omega 6, to 3 ratio. I covered a mega 6 in my health series. I put the link in the description below in a typical Western diet. Our ratio is 16 to 1. Whereas ideally, we would want for to 1 or less. And make a six is found in a lot of cooking oils nuts and nearly all processed.  Omega-3 could be taken as a supplement or better, still make sure you get several portions of wild salmon a week as well as a portion of the other oily fish. Like, mackerel and sardines, 11, get more magnesium Studies have shown that increasing magnesium will improve sensitivity and you'll get it in leafy greens, like spinach as well as foods, like pumpkin and sesame seeds. You can also take a supplement. I take zma before bed, which is zinc, and magnesium 12, drink some green tea.  Green tea has been shown to improve the uptake of glucose into muscle and reduce the uptake into body fat 13. There are things. You can add to your food to balance blood sugar. Cinnamon is great for lowering the spike in your blood sugar levels. I remember that is something like ground. Cinnamon not cinnamon Graham has other for other foods that help include sauerkraut apple cider vinegar. Tumeric and walnuts, eat these with your high carb meals for a more sustained release of energy 14 when dealing with  Teen try to avoid, combining it with sugar Instead. Try to combine it with some healthy fats. As the addition of fat will buffer, the release of insulin finally, 15 be aware that a large portion of protein can also trigger an insulin release. I think a good Max is around 50 grams of protein in a single meal. The better you stick to these guidelines, the sooner, you can restore your insulin sensitivity. If you think you might be insulin resistant, you can check out a great video by dr. Berg which I put in the description below.  To steal from his checklist symptoms of chronically elevated. Insulin levels include belly fat, swollen ankles. A strong craving for carbs a feeling like, you need to nap after each meal and brain fog. That's it for today. In the next episode. I'm going to cover good food sources for gaining muscle, or losing fat. Thanks for watching.\",\n",
       " '2XW0z218': \"37 at the University of Illinois, graduate student, Michaels Veda, puts down his cigarette because yes, he was smoking in the research lab, a common practice, until the 1970s. He was working on antipyretics or anti fever medications. But what ended up on his cigarette was a substance called sodium. Cyclamate brand name sugar twin another lab. Another day. 1965 James Slaughter work.  In for a company looking for stomach ulcer medication. He was leafing through some lab papers licked his finger. And the result was aspartame. Brand name. NutraSweet.  On to 1976 where a young Indian born scientists Shasha confidence was evaluating new chemicals. For use in research products. His boss asked him to test a particular chlorinated form of sucrose. He misunderstood, and instead tasted. What would become sucralose brand name Splenda?  Anyone else noticing a theme? I suspect. The next big sweetener is waiting to be discovered on the back of someone's lap book. I suggest any of you out there that work in Labs, begin tasting, every spill and stain on the bench.  Let's jump back to saccharine initially. It was recognized that it could benefit diabetics and its low-cost made it competitive with cane sugar. Although many dislike the bitter aftertaste US president Teddy. Roosevelt was quite a fan and user and when the predecessor of the FDA proposed regulation on the use of saccharin as a cheap substitute for sugar Teddy stepped in and formed his own scientific board to review the safety.  We of saccharin the board returned a positive bill of health and saccharine remained in use thanks to presidential intercession saccharine became very popular following sugar rationing during WWII and post-war America. Continue to use saccharine as both a low cost and low calorie option. Everything was great until the 1970s when test of the sweetener showed evidence of increased risk of bladder cancer in rats. There were immediate call.  The ban the substance but since it was the only diet sweetener on the market, it was left available, but with a warning label and so the world decided that saccharine was a carcinogen the labels made that very clear in. Our memories are long on such things. Saccharin causes cancer. You knew that right?  In late 2000, those labels were removed. They were removed because saccharine doesn't cause cancer in humans. Like it doesn't rats rats. Have some distinctive urinary characteristics that make them susceptible to sakharine's effects. They excrete protein, complexes and calcium phosphate in their urine.  The saccharine was being excreted, but at high pH, it was forming precipitants. And this irritated, the bladder lining, which resulted in a slight increase in bladder cancer. If you have a pet rat, do not allow them to drink saccharin. What about humans though?  No linkage to human cancers has ever been. Well, demonstrated for saccharin, when the unique properties of rat urine are taken into account. It appears to be harmless in them as well. Most importantly, for a possible carcinogen saccharine doesn't interact with DNA. It's not a mutagen the mechanism by which most artificial substances, promote cancer admittedly. I hate the taste of saccharin as to a lot of people. It has that terrible bitter. After taste and the flavor is just a little too.  Fake tasting.  But even though it's made from coal tar, it's about as safe as the sugar that's extracted from giant piles of Cain grass, switch Focus to a more recent addition to the low calorie sweetener Market in the u.s. Stevia or Stevia. If you prefer Stevia is a natural product extracted from a family of shrubs and herbs the key ingredient, a class of compounds called steviol glycosides or Stevia sides are hundreds of times sweeter than sucrose yet can  Tribute very few calories and can actually be anti-inflammatory and have a positive effect on regulating blood sugar. I want very much to love this sweeter. But there's a catch, unlike saccharine, some or all steviol glycosides are known to interact with DNA. Not much mind you and Stevia has been repeatedly cleared for carcinogenic activity, but it possesses the mutagenic potential that saccharine does not.  I'm not saying it's bad. I'm saying that escalating doses of it will have escalating risks where saccharin has a relatively flat risk. Want to kick off this video with a short discussion of the appeal to Nature fallacy. You couldn't wish for a better example of its Akron which is made from oily. Coal residue is the epitome of artificial and chemical Stevia, which is a fairly crude extract of a leaf that has been used safely by people in South America and Japan.  For decades is the epitome of natural products and yet their origins in the lab or the forest, make no difference in determining their safety.  Ultimately, we may conclude that Stevia is a much safer product than saccharine or that they're both safe, but it's not where they come from that determines this, carcinogens mutagens and toxins are found everywhere in nature perfectly safe. Substances can be made from petroleum, coal tar, or Industrial Waste. It's wrong to assume the other way, as well. Not every sweet-tasting stain, on a lab. Notebook is going to turn out to be a boon for mankind.  Until we empirically test, something for safety. There is no way to generalize based entirely on where we found it.  There is an element of vitalism in this argument a belief in the immaterial, essence of something, an artificial substance will carry with it. The essence of something, from the harsh lights and accurate smells of the lab, where a natural substance carries, only the warm sunshine and soft Earth. A simple reality. Check on substances, like tobacco mycotoxins in poison, dart frogs. Will dispel this.  There's another application of the appeal to Nature fallacy. And that's the argument from Evolution fallacy. It's tempting to say that because we evolved to eat nuts and roots. That this diet is optimal for our biology. It sometimes happens that this is true, that natural selection is weeded out undesirable traits or behaviors or eliminated toxins or that our physiology adapted to compensate for some external Force.  On the other hand, natural selection is a very poor innovator. It's just as happy with a good enough solution to a problem as to the optimal solution. It's a Hallmark of evolution that it never invents. It only adapts existing structures to new tasks. So it's not a reasonable argument. That natural selection validates a diet or behavior as being optimal with this perspective in mind. Let's examine just a few of the major low-calorie sweeteners.  Unfortunately, there are so many non-caloric sweetener that have had to narrow the field. I've selected aspartame, sucralose Stevia, Acesulfame potassium, and some common sugar. Alcohols as examples will have to keep the details to a minimum to keep this short citations in the underbar. Before we start. I want to discuss the generalized benefits of low-calorie sweeteners. One. It seems a bit redundant, but they're low-calorie.  Unlike hfcs or sucrose, they don't contribute to an excess of sugar calories, which presumably means that consuming the same portion contributes less to caloric excess, which can contribute to obesity to, they have a low glycemic index with the notable exception of sugar alcohols, which we will get to low-calorie sweeteners. Don't cause blood sugar spikes, which is important for people with blood sugar dysregulation.  3. Here's a big one. They don't contribute to bacterial. Erosion of tooth enamel. So dental health is improved. I could add lower-cost here, but I personally don't think that's the case to the consumer. Any more intense sweeteners have become associated with more expensive, diet forms of popular products. What about the possible generic risks to any sweetener?  One overcompensation. This is a big one and very controversial right now in the research Community people met and I emphasize may give themselves permission to eat Foods bad for them. If they also consume a product perceived as diet or low calorie think of someone on a weight-reduction diet who orders a Diet Coke with their McDonald's. Triple cheeseburger in large fries. They might buy The Diet Coke and justify the rest because they're cutting back on calories on the so.  The research to date has found very little evidence of this. Most studies support the use of low-calorie sweeteners for weight loss, but there are a few especially on non-human models that show a paradoxical weight gain, and the cause is not entirely clear.  To addiction to sweetness low-calorie sweeteners, reinforce our brains demand for sweeter flavors. This might mean that we prefer foods with harsher additive derived flavors rather than adjusting to the softer. Sweetness of unmodified foods. I'm an advocate of a diet rich in vegetables and fruit, but it would seem harder to get kids to eat strawberries for dessert. If they get used to super sweet and candy or sugar sweetened cakes and cookies.  Again, there is very little evidence to support this intuitive. Conclusion, when people are presented with a choice of foods after drinking, either sucrose sweetened or artificially sweetened drinks. They still made the same choices either good or bad.  Three uncoupling, the expectation of satiety and the blood sugar Spike.  Recent research has focused on whether people eat more food after drinking a sugary drink or an artificially sweetened drink, our bodies anticipate meals and begin preparing. Well before the first calorie of food, enters the mouth, if we anticipate a blood sugar Spike, but none happens, what effect will that have so far the majority\",\n",
       " 'XFRWFHx6tA': \"With acute pyelonephritis. Pilo means pelvis and Neff refers the kidney. So, in this case, it's the renal pelvis, which is the funnel, like, structure of the kidney that drains, urine into the ureter and itís means inflammation. So acute pyelonephritis describes an inflamed kidney that develops relatively quickly. Usually, as a result of a bacterial infection.  Now a urinary tract infection or UTI is any infection of the urinary tract, which includes the upper portion of the tracked, the kidneys in the ureters and the lower portion of the tract, the bladder and the urethra.  So, acute pyelonephritis is a type of upper urinary tract infection.  Acute pyelonephritis is most often caused by ascending infection meaning bacteria. Start by colonizing the urethra and bladder, which would be a lower urinary tract infection and make their way up the ureter to the kidney. Therefore, upper UTI shares. A lot of the same risk factors as lower. UTI things like female sex, sexual intercourse, indwelling, catheters, diabetes, mellitus, and urinary, tract obstruction.  One, major factor that increases the risk of an upper UTI from a lower. UTI spreading upward is a vesicle ureteral reflux or vur which were yoren's allowed to move, backward up the urinary tract, which can happen. If the vesicle ureteral orifice fails, the vesicle ureteral orifice, is the one-way valve that allows urine to flow from each ureter into the bladder, but not in the reverse Direction.  Vur can be the result of a primary congenital defect or it can be caused by bladder Outlet obstruction, which increases pressure in the bladder and distorts the valve, as kind of a double whammy obstruction also leads to urinary. Stasis where urine stands still, which makes it easier for bacteria to adhere and colonize the urinary tract.  So, for ascending infections that cause acute pyelonephritis, the most common organisms are E.coli, Proteus, species, and in Tarot bacter species, all of which are commonly found in the bowel Flora.  Now it's also possible that the kidneys get infected via hematogenous infection or spread through the bloodstream. Although this is a lot less common. Usually pyelonephritis from hematogenous. Spread is a consequence of septicemia or bacteremia, which is bacteria in the blood as well as infective endocarditis. An infection of the inner layer of the heart.  In these situations, the most common organisms are staphylococcus species. And again, you coli.  Acute pyelonephritis is most often unilateral meaning affects just one kidney and when bacteria Mountain intact, they usually start by adhering to the renal epithelium of the tubules, which triggers an inflammatory response chemokines attract neutrophils to the Reno interstitium, but typically the glomeruli in vessels of the kidney are spared.  As neutrophils infiltrate and die off. They make their way through the urinary tract in our P. Dowd. So people with acute pyelonephritis often have white blood cells in their urine, sometimes the cells in the surrounding inflammatory, protein debris is even casted into the shape of the tubule, which is then also peed out and is called a white blood cell cast.  Patients also can present with increased white blood cells in their blood called leukocytosis. And as a result of the inflammatory, immune response patients can also develop fevers chills. Nausea and vomiting, as well as flank pain at the costovertebral angle.  These systemic symptoms are what often distinguish acute pyelonephritis from a lower urinary tract. Infection treatments typically antibiotics in making sure that the individual stays well hydrated, like most bacterial infections. There's also a possibility of a Reno abscess that can form as a complication.  Also, if there are recurrent infections, which can be the case in people with an anatomic problem, that allows bacteria to easily cause infections, then it can lead to Chronic pyelonephritis as well as papillary necrosis or death of the renal papilla tissue, which has a much worse prognosis because that can affect the kidneys overall ability to function.  All right, as a quick recap acute pyelonephritis is typically a bacterial infection of the upper urinary tract, which usually develops from a lower urinary tract infection, especially in individuals with vesicle ureteral reflux.  The infection causes systemic symptoms like fevers in flank pain at the costovertebral angle and is treated with antibiotics.  Thanks for watching.

       " 'vzA7Dj1pCOg': \"Assalamualaikum. Hello everyone. Welcome to another ATP video. Where we will be discussing the topic of gluconeogenesis. In this video. We will discuss this sources and consumption of glucose in our body as well as explain the process of gluconeogenesis and really dive deep in the matter.  Now, before we discuss gluconeogenesis, it's important to understand how glucose is used and obtained and the significance of hepatic processes that control glucose level the brain, red blood cells. Kidney medulla ones, cornea testes and exercising. Muscles need a continuous supply of glucose to remain functional. The liver is responsible for maintaining glucose levels of the blood and to ensure that these organs get the glucose they need.  Now this is achieved by two important processes glycogenolysis, which is the breakdown of glycogen and gluconeogenesis, which is the production of new glucose. Hence, the word Neo and this is our topic for today. The major source of glucose is exoticness glucose. That is the glucose obtained from food. We eat namely carbohydrates dietary galactose and fructose can be converted to glucose in the liver.  And now this exoticness Supply. Its rapidly used up by the body lasting something around 4 to 5 hours on average during fasting. The glucose supplies provided by the breakdown of glycogen in the liver. And this can last somewhere between 10 to 18 hours. Glycogen breakdown drops dramatically after the first 12 hours during, which gluconeogenesis increases after say, 24 to 48 hours gluconeogenesis represents the only source of glucose.  During an overnight fast. 90% of glucose production occurs in the liver. While the remaining 10% occurs in the kidneys. However, during a prolonged fast, the kidneys become the major glucose producing organs, a carbon source is required for the production of glucose to be possible important substrates for gluconeogenesis are lactates from anaerobic glycolysis and pyruvate from aerobic glycolysis, the Cyril, three, phosphate from the breakdown of triglycerides and adipose tissue.  And finally, gluconeogenic me, no acids, from protein breakdown, all amino acids, except leucine and lysine. The two L's are gluconeogenesis, amino acids, and can therefore be used in gluconeogenesis, alanine is the major gluconeogenic amino acid. These amino acids are converted to citric acid cycle. Intermediates, then to malate following the same path from there to glucose in humans. It's not really possible to convert fatty acids into glucose, but the only  Come to that rule is the odd. Number carbon fatty acids. So fatty acids with 17, carbons, 15 carbons, you get the picture and this will yield a small amount of gluconeogenesis propionyl, COA. Now that we've learned the required substrates for gluconeogenesis. We will continue by explaining the sequence of reactions that make up this pathway. So, as we've learned before glycolysis, the breakdown of glucose consists of ten reactions, seven of which are reversible.  And three of which are irreversible now because of these three irreversible reactions, which are, you know, 13 and 10 gluconeogenesis does not simply occur by the reversal of glycolysis. These reactions must be replaced by reactions that favor the production of glucose. Think of these irreversible reactions as obstacles or roadblocks that must be overcome. Now since we're working backwards, the first rope block is reaction 10 of glycolysis. The irreversible conversion of phospholipids.  Pyruvate to pyruvate by pyruvate kinase to yield pep from pyruvate, for gluconeogenesis. We need to enzymes pyruvate carboxylase and pep carboxykinase. The reaction goes as such pyruvate carboxylase carboxylates, pyruvate in the mitochondria to form oxaloacetate oxaloacetate a TCA cycle. Intermediates cannot pass through the mitochondrial membrane into the cytoplasm. It is reduced to malate.  Which leaves the mitochondria through the malate shuttle and enters the cytoplasm where it is. Reoxidized back to oxaloacetate auxiliary acetate is done decarboxylated and phosphorylated by pep carboxykinase to form. Finally pep pep is then acted on by the reactions of glycolysis going in the opposite direction until it becomes fructose 1 6 bisphosphate. We've now reached the second, roadblock in the pathway step 3 of glycolysis, also.  And as the phosphorylation of fructose, 6-phosphate to fructose 1 6 bisphosphate basically just adding another phosphate to the molecule in glycolysis. This irreversible step is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphofructokinase one in gluconeogenesis. Phosphofructokinase 1 is replaced by fructose 1 6 bisphosphate A's so you can pretty much guess what this enzyme would do.  It'll hide your lies. Fructose 1 6 bisphosphate to form fructose 6 phosphate, which is then converted to glucose 6-phosphate by the reversible glycolytic reaction. Number 2. The final roadblock in this pathway is reaction 1 of glycolysis, glucose-6-phosphatase replaces hexokinase, glucose 6, phosphate is transported from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum where it's hydrolyzed by glucose-6-phosphatase to form free glucose. Now this free glucose, it will re-enter the  Cytosol from which it leaves the cell. An important notes glucose-6-phosphatase is a hepatic enzyme. Meaning you can only really find in a deliver. The absence of this enzyme from skeletal muscle accounts, for the fact that muscle glycogen cannot serve as a source of blood glucose.  It's also important to note that once the liver forms glucose through gluconeogenesis. This can't really be used as an energy source for the liver.  And with that said, will conclude this video about gluconeogenesis. We hope you benefited from this video. Consider liking and subscribing. And as always, thanks for watching.\",\n",

Crucial is the diagnosis of diabetes if you can't measure it, how can you take action to fix it?  First, we see the common fasting, blood glucose test here, you fast overnight, and then you get a blood draw. This is a very poor test for diabetes around. 90% of the people who failed crafts proper tests were easily able to pass this one. So it misses most. By the time, your fasting blood glucose is out of control. You've been diabetic for a long, long time. Now, we see the far less common glucose tolerance test. You might get this if you fail the fasting.  Here you drink a set amount of glucose and then get the blood glucose level tested at regular intervals. This is more useful than the fasting test. But more than half of the people who failed crafts proper tests were able to pass this one. So it misses the majority. By the time, your glucose tolerance is out of control. You've been diabetic for a long time.  Now, we get to crafts test, one that properly diagnosis. The high insulin disease of diabetes, similar to the last glucose tolerance test, you drink 100 grams of glucose that the start. But crucially, you then measure the blood insulin levels over time this achieves engineering level Precision for identifying diabetes. This is the test that tells if you are exposed to heart and many other diseases of hyperinsulinemia,  This is a proper diagnosis for diabetes.  Let's look. Now at the patterns you can get from crafts insulin response test pattern. One shown here is healthy with a nice low insulin response to the glucose craft called is you insulae Mia or truly non-diabetic, your arteries are running cool and safe and your chances of disease are absolutely minimized. Secondly. We see pattern to with a distinctly higher response to the glucose. This is hyperinsulinemia or truly,  Inset, you your arteries are not safe and chronic disease probability is ramping up passion tree is similar hyperinsulinemia, and it's essentially diabetic or diabetes in. Situ. You've got a high insulin response with a delayed fall. Your arteries are inflamed and the many chronic diseases of diabetes Lion. Wait pattern for has a very high insulin response, which are dramatically delayed fall. This too is  Mia or diabetes in search you and hear your arteries are really on fire. Chronic disease is upon you.  So there we have it. One clear unambiguous healthy response in the most important Health tests, you can get and three of unmistakable disease. Presence craft tested fourteen thousand three hundred and eighty four people in this way over 30 years. So what proportion of the ones with normal glucose results were actually diabetic in his real correct test. The answer is more than 75 percent. These people had okay, glucose results.  They were not. Okay, they were diabetic.  Kraft had an extraordinary career in pathology also and we close with his insights from his research and over 3,000 autopsies. He personally conducted firstly, the damage of diabetes is vascular or arterial anyone with this damage must be assumed diabetic unless they can past crafts insulin pattern test with a pattern one response. Secondly, the vascular damage begins before the blood glucose is markedly elevated here. Craft.  The work of pathologist Kimmel steel who clearly identified kidney vascular damage from hyperinsulinemia. Before the patients, went on to have high glucose levels camel, steel Wilson disease is accepted as diagnostic of diabetes. In fact, it is the only pathology uniquely classed as diabetic. Finally, the diabetic condition drives disease and all the arteries from the main vessels of the heart to the tiny, capillaries in the retina and elsewhere opthamologist can effectively do  Diagnose diabetes by this damage before people would fail. The glucose tests also craft identified Mike Road vessel damage in the Hartz IV septum where the rhythm of the heart is controlled and maintained. He proposes that this is also where the hyper insulin hits and kills true. The arrhythmia that leads to sudden cardiac death and millions will now get to meet the great man and discuss his life's work, but we're close to the profound statement of his, which Millions would do well to heed.  Those with cardiovascular disease, not identified with diabetes are simply undiagnosed. I hope you're enjoying our conversation as much as I did, and I hope you'll get his book through Amazon, you and your loved ones will benefit greatly from the knowledge. Thank you.  Okay, I'm here today to meet. Dr. Joseph craft. It was an extraordinary career in pathology and in nuclear medicine and has carried out. One of the most extraordinary characterizations of over 15,000 people for glucose tolerance with insulin assays, which has delivered great insights into the extent. True extent of diabetes in our world today.  In the lecture period about the second year.  He said, dr. Kraft. I have a wonderful assignment for you next year. I want you to give a complete comprehensive, lecture and diabetes in two hours.  I said golub. Yes, sir. You know that's like saying cover the Bible in about two hours two and he pulled back the curtain and I said you see all those people over 200 cell for scepter.  One of the first things I did was review the world literature other. What I could find about diabetes.  I ran across dr. Yellow and dr. Bruce since wonderful work. Dr. Yellow. It was a physicist and Doctor a person, an interior Cinema section of radio when I sees a VA hospital in Upstate, New York.  And between the two of them must have had a lot of brain power because they managed to come up with the technique, in which, the actually label in some. However, there was no rule standard.  No, who's the Swedish company and pharmaceutical company? No one is pharmacia and they came up with the World Health standard for insulin. I said, what be? Here we go. So we started doing adding them to all of our glucose, insulin tolerance has now after I had  500 of these. I compared to what you have. One person had report. Now we have to put this in, its proper perspective. Yellow and Burson were swimming Upstream. They say, what do you mean?  There's insulin and diabetes don't you know that diabetes is ADD absence of insulin. They said no, we don't know that. So that's about where they were now. They had so very wonderful papers. I got rejected by some of the finest training institutions in the world D. So this was this huge resistance to the idea that a low insulin disease.  You could actually have a lot of insulin present and those below. Yeah. Yeah, she the alien, or in some fit in with him. So many the decision in the slightest idea, what it was. I think if we put it into perspective, the relative size of a molecule of insulin be like a Pina compared to an elephant and they had to come up with the Sanford way of measuring it and everything else they call them micro units, so  That was it though. That made it very very interesting.  We did about 500 of them. They were with all kinds of people, all ranges of abnormal glucose tolerance for using the Ada standards on this. So I took about five, six hundred of them home, put them into file, according to out what the, in some patterns were has a certain definite. Definite difference is coming under.  so,  We started comparing the results. We were swimming Upstream to we knew that because we presented at a path meaning. They say, doctors. So sure. It's companies aren't going to buy that. Yeah, that's right. But his insurance company should determine how we practice silence. So it's about where it was.  When we got the 500, I put them all to sleep out. Then then I presented a paper By Invitation George Stephenson. It was, I don't know the name of the meeting. There was a big meeting in Washington, d.c. I mostly people interested in testing laboratory procedures and we presented hours and it was a hit.  It was people like the idea. They liked the idea. So we went hunting there. We got that one published.  And within a few months later after we had, we know, had over 1,000.  Procedures like that and present it. When at the oh no a society of pathology meeting and behold, they liked it. That's two and then finally became long is that  The.  Testing.\",\n",

Other less common causes are medications that put stress on the pancreas elevated. Triglycerides, some autoimmune conditions and some inherited or genetic conditions notably cystic fibrosis and hereditary pancreatitis in some people the cause of chronic pancreatitis is never discovered and remains a mystery. The pancreas is a digestive system organ that has two important functions. It produces hormones that regulate blood sugar.  Or as well as enzymes to break down food in the digestive tract.  When the pancreas doesn't work properly, it affects the body's ability to properly digest food. This means that some people with chronic pancreatitis are unable to get the nutrients. They need from the food. They eat, they can have trouble digesting food properly or maintaining their blood sugar in a healthy range. This can lead to nutrition related disease such as weak bones and vision loss. Some people may also have difficulty gaining or maintaining their weight and  Assistant pain, the Hallmark symptom of chronic pancreatitis is abdominal pain. The pain may be intermittent or chronic and is frequently very severe with stabbing pains localized. In the upper part of the abdomen between the belly button, and the chest, the pain May radiate to the back and may be triggered by eating. Especially high fat foods. As the disease progresses, the pain may become more severe and debilitating and often it becomes  Is constant in some cases surgery or endoscopic treatment may be required.

Depending on the severity and extent of the damage to the pancreas, some people develop diabetes.  A combination of tests are used to diagnose chronic pancreatitis in some people. Diagnosis is challenging due to the course of the disease. However, in others, it is relatively straightforward. A CT scan of the abdomen is the most commonly used test an MRI or endoscopic. Ultrasound may also be used to confirm the diagnosis.  In some difficult to diagnose cases. Pancreatic stimulation testing can be useful. This test, artificially stimulates the pancreas using secretin. This test is expensive and invasive. So it is not frequently performed.  Blood tests are not useful for diagnosing.

Acromegaly eventually leads to disfigurement as well as a variety of other symptoms that can possibly lead to other disorders and diseases.  Pictured is a woman with acromegaly. This presentation will explain the causes signs and symptoms and treatments associated with acromegaly.  What causes acromegaly acromegaly is mainly caused by the presence of a benign tumor on the pituitary gland. The pituitary glands are responsible for strong for storing and secreting hormones. The presence of this tumor causes the pituitary gland to secrete more growth hormone than necessary. And rare circumstances growth hormone can be secreted by the pre the pancreas, or the liver.

       " 'WBjchfwi1jA': \"Neuropathy or damage to the nerves is a debilitating disorder. Diabetes is by far the most common cause up to fifty percent of diabetics will eventually develop neuropathy during the course of their disease. It can be very painful and the pain is frequently resistant to Conventional treatments. In fact, there are currently considered no effective treatment for diabetic neuropathy clinicians rely on steroids opiates and antidepressants to try to mediate the suffering. Twenty years ago a remarkable study was published on the regression of diabetic neuropathy with a plant-based diet. There are two types of diabetic neuropathy a relatively painless type characterized by numbness tingling and pins and needle Sensations and then a second form which is painful with burning or aching Sensations to the point of excruciating lancinating stabbing pain this study concentrated on the painful type xxi.  Excel frame with moderate or Worse symptomatic painful neuropathy for up to 10 years were placed on a whole food plant-based diet along with a half hour of walking everyday years and years of suffering and then complete relief of pain and 17 of the 21 patients within days.  Numbness noticeably improved to and the side effects were all good. They lost 10 pounds blood sugar's got better insulin. He's dropped in half and in five of the patients not only apparently was their painful neuropathy cured so was their diabetes normal blood sugars off of all medications and their triglycerides and cholesterol improved to high blood pressures got better. In fact gone in about half the hypertensives and 80% drop overall in the need for high blood pressure medications within three weeks.  Now this was a live in program where patients meals were provided what happened when they were sent home the 17 folks were followed for years in an all except one the relief from the painful neuropathy continued or improved even farther. How'd they get that kind of compliance pain and ill-health are strong motivating factors.  One of the most painful and frustrating conditions to treat in all of medicine and 75 percent cured in a couple days with a natural non-toxic. In fact beneficial treatment a diet composed of whole plant Foods, how could nerve damage be reversed? So suddenly it wasn't necessarily the Improvement in blood sugar control since it took about 10 days for the diet to control the diabetes. Where's the pain was gone in as few as four days.  There are several mechanisms by which a total vegetarian diet Works to alleviate the problem of diabetic neuropathy as well as the diabetic condition itself. The most interesting speculation was that it could be the trans fats naturally found in meat and dairy and refined vegetable oils that could be causing an inflammatory response. They found a significant percentage of the fat found under the skin of those who ate meat or dairy consisted of trans fats. Whereas those on a strictly Whole Food plant-based.  Had none, they stuck needles in the buttocks of people eating different diets and nine months or more on a strict plant-based diet appeared to remove the trans fat from their bodies or at least their butts, but their pain didn't take nine months to get better got better in days. So more likely it was due to an improvement in blood flow nerve biopsies and diabetics with severe Progressive neuropathy of shown small vessel disease within the nerve there.  Our blood vessels within our nerves that can get clogged up the oxygen levels in the nerves of diabetics was found to be lower than even that of deoxygenated blood this lack of oxygen within the nerve may arise from blockages within the blood vessels depriving the nerve of oxygen presumably leading them to cry out in pain within days though improvements in blood rheology the ease of blood flow on a plant-based diet May.  A prominent role in the reversal of diabetic neuropathy plant-based diets may also lower the level of igf-1 inside the eyeballs of diabetics and decrease the risk of retinopathy diabetic vision loss as well. But the most efficient way to avoid diabetic complications is to eliminate the diabetes and this is often feasible for those type 2 patients who make an abiding commitment to daily exercise and a healthy enough diet.  Since the initial report of neuropathy reversal, the results have been replicated significant improvements and numbness and burning.

This condition is a process in which deposits of fatty material called plaque, build up inside the walls of arteries, reducing or completely blocking blood flow. Although, the exact causes of atherosclerosis are not clear, many scientists think it begins with damage to the inner wall of an artery called the endothelium substances traveling in the blood. Such as cholesterol fats, and cellular waste products, accumulate inside the damaged area of the arterial wall. Chemical reactions occurring within the buildup of material cause cholesterol molecules to oxidize this initiates an inflammatory response in which the endothelial cells at the damaged site release chemicals, that signal a call for help in response, monocytes from the bloodstream.  Travel to the damaged site. Stimulation, from oxidized cholesterol converts the monocytes into macrophages, the macrophages eat and digest the cholesterol molecules as a result of this process, the macrophages change into foam cells, which accumulate to form plaque as the plaque increases in size. The arterial wall, thickens and hardens.  At the same time, smooth muscle cells, within the arterial wall. Begin to multiply.  Most of the smooth muscle cells move to the surface of the plaque. These cells contribute to the formation of a firm fibrous cap covering the plaque.  Eventually the passageway, through the artery Narrows enough to reduce blood flow and the amount of oxygen received by the organs at supplies. Over time, the cat May erode and break open releasing plaque into the bloodstream. The plaque can flow Downstream and contribute to the formation of a blood clot, which can stop blood flow.

       " 'wbWL2wfvsM8': \"In the video on the sodium-potassium pump. We talked about how it helps us helps us, L establish, its resting membrane potential and it does that by pumping actively pumping, three, sodium ions, out for every two potassium ions. It pumps in, and that by itself, that ratio of 3 to 2 by itself, doesn't establish the full resting membrane potential, but then the potassium ions are allowed to start to start diffusing down, their concentration, gradient from the inside, back to the outside. And  Of course, there's a balancing Force. There are balancing Factor there and that's the charge. Because of the outside is more positive than the inside a positively charged ion, which the potassium ions are. Well, it's something, they're not going to want to go up here so much because of their charge. It's more positive here than it is over here. They had actually want to go back, but their concentration gradient, they're going to be bumping into the bottom of this channel more than the top. And so you're going to have a balanced, they're going to start diffusing through, but you're not going to have equal concentrations.  Because the charge is going to keep them back here. But what about the sodium ions? The sodium, ions are getting more and more concentrated up here and up here is getting more and more positive. If the sodium ions were left to their own devices. If there was no membrane over here, they would naturally. If we just looked at the concentration, gradient. They would naturally want to diffuse down. We have a high concentration over here. We have a low concentration over there. So if there was no membrane, then you, they would just naturally diffuse from high to low. That's their concentration, gradient.  And also, if there was no membrane, we've already talked about it being much more positive on this side than it is on this side, or you could say we have a positive potential difference between here and here. So, the positively charged ions, like the sodium's up here, would want to go down because of their charge. And so there's two reasons why they would want to go from this side of the membrane to that side of the membrane, their concentration, gradient, and the, and their charge the electric potential. There's this potential.  Energy of them, wanting to get away from all the positive charges. And so that combined motivation for the sodium ions to go in that direction. We call that the electrochemical gradient Electro Electro, chemical chemical gradient, and I'm already said it once, but I'll say it again. It's a combination of the electric gradient, and the chemical gradient, the chemical gradient. You have higher concentration here, lower here. You would want to diffuse.  Use down more things are going to bump on this side, then on this side. So you're going to have a net, net flow down. If you didn't have this memory in here. And then when you think about the electric potential, more positive on this side than this side. So positive ions would want to go down. And so you could view this gradient as a source of potential energy and cells. In fact, use this gradient. In fact, the sodium electrochemical gradient as a source of energy. And so this let's say this this protein right over here. This is what we're going to  All a symporter. This is a symporter. And what it does is it uses the electrochemical gradient of one ion in this case, but in this case sodium. So it uses the fact that sodium really wants to go through the membrane and it uses that energy imagine like water falling down a waterfall and it can turn a it can turn a turbine or can turn a water mill type of thing. And so it uses that energy of the sodium flowing down its electrochemical.  Gradient. It wants to go in this direction for two reasons, concentration, and electric potential. So or I guess you see it's electrostatic charge and then it uses that energy to transport other things. And the most famous symporter with sodium is glucose. It's going to use that the sodium and the glucose are going to go together and the glucose is being transported against its concentration, gradient. And so if you're going to transport something against its act against its concentration gradient, you're going to have to use active transport, so  This concentration gradient. So let me be clear on glucose is concentration. Gradient. It looks like this. You have high concentration over here and you have low right over here and the cell might not want to waste all this glucose. He wants to get as much glucose into the cell or cross the membrane as possible. And so it's going to have to do some active transport to go against its concentration. Gradient to go to go in this direction. And over here, the source of energy to go against the concentration. Gradient is the stored is the stored potential.  All energy from the electrochemical gradient of the sodium. And so, this type of active transport, where you're using, where you're using the energy that was stored up through a another form of active transport. The sodium potassium pump. We call this secondary active transport. So what's going over here? This sodium glucose symporter. This is secondary, active transport, secondary active, active transport. It's using its using the stored energy.  From one from the electrochemical gradient of one molecule. It's using that stored energy to drive the active transport of another molecule glucose going against its concentration. Gradient.\",\n",

Million children and 600 3.7 million, adults is now obese. Okay, so I want to show you a fun little  Art that was created by Vox to show you. You know what the trend kind of looks like. And if you look since the 1980s there has been an upward trend for every demographic, men women and children. So since 1980, the Obesity prevalence has doubled in more than 70 countries, around the world. Mainly in low and middle income regions and it has steadily increased in nearly every other country. Now, this is the part of the study that I really want to stress because  Well, some of you might already know this, while some of you have probably been screaming this from mountaintops and trying to get people to understand. A lot of people are under the impression. That as long as you're physically active, you can eat whatever you want. You'll have a healthy body weight, but that is not the case. And finally, this study, clearly lays that out physical activity levels began to decline before the global obesity rate started to Surge, which means changes to the food environment, are the prime obesity culprit. So, the researchers here are saying no,  It is not a lack of exercise. This has everything to do with the types of foods were eating the amount of food, we're eating and so they focus on that more than you know, physical activity exercise is excellent for health. That's not to say you shouldn't exercise but it's not important for weight loss. The two things should never be given equal weight in the Obesity debate. Now a few more details for you guys before you jump in the researchers, estimated that a high body weight contributed to 4 million deaths globally, or  Seven percent of the deaths from any cause, in 2015, most of those deaths were caused by cardiovascular disease with diabetes, following closely behind along with kidney disease, which, by the way, is exacerbated or even triggered by diabetes and also cancers. So, this is just incredible, especially, when you consider the number of people, the fact that it impacts not only the United States or other developed countries, but it impacts a lot of different countries. In fact, they looked  Nearly 200 different countries and found that this trend is true of pretty much everywhere that they went for Vietnam. By the way. These are countries that didn't have this problem for a long time obviously, and we I hate to be a self-hating Westerner, but we have exported this cheap crappy food to the world and I'm not saying I know that many of us like the dip to McDonald's or whatever as an Indulgence. I don't need it, but I understand it, but what's  Happening. Is that's a low-cost way to get this calorie intense food, but it's nutrient-poor and it's going to all of these different countries all over the world. And as we've exported this, we've also exported our obesity problem. So I think again, I think it starts where the where the prime movers in this. No doubt. It's I think it's several things that contribute it to it. And I think that lack of education is a huge one. That's what whenever I talk about specific issues and health.  Stress. That the simple things like people will consider Pizza. I believed to be a vegetable and I served in the United States because it's got tomato puree in it, like just absurd things like politicians will argue. They will literally argue that the tomato sauce with the ketchup and the school lunches discovered a vegetable because they don't want to spend the extra money to provide decent school lunches for students started and I don't know that's it's just a cot.

Not to look on the furthest end of the spectrum. If you're trying to lose weight. I'm talking about, you. Just want to make a slight change in your body. I can go to the gym for months. But if I go and eat crap every single day, nothing, I'm going to get worse. Nothing's Gonna Change. I don't care. If I'm running five, six miles a day because it's all about  What understanding, what your body needs in order to get healthier and order to adjust and that starts with education? Yes, a very early age, telling kids that. Yeah, you're eating an old McDonald's once in a while is not going to kill you.

That is one day going to replace what the pancreas is doing. The new artificial pancreas is combined and insulin pump with A continuous glucose monitor. So a continuous glucose monitor has a little electrode that's it's right beneath the skin and will For the blood sugar continuously every few minutes and that glucose monitor will then communicate directly with the insulin pump. So instead of having to have the patient manually, check a blood sugar with a glucometer and enter in that blood sugar value into the pump. That number will be transmitted directly to the pump. What makes this more towards an artificial pancreas. Is the insulin pump can then make decisions simply based on those blood sugars.  Basically, what it does. For our patients with diabetes is takes all of that information about blood sugars and gives it to them. In real time for parents often.

       " 'WI8_9PIyWN4': \"Ken's. I think that some of the advantages to using the insulin pen is that they can be when used properly more accurate than using a vial and syringe. They also can provide some discretion when people eat out in restaurants. They also provide a more frequent turnover of the insulin. So in an Insulin Pen, cartridge, there are 300 units versus 1000 units that use in each of the insulin vials. So people tend to  to start new insulin more often. It is important to let patients know that it is okay to keep their insulin at room temperature. If they have extra insulin, certainly store that in the refrigerator, but the insulin that they are currently using is okay at room temperature. Many times patients will leave their insulin at home rather than bringing it with them to a restaurant because they're afraid of having it out of the refrigerator and that can cause them to miss doses. I am going.  Show you a couple of the different pens on the market in a couple of minutes and I'll show you how someone would give an injection using that insulin pen. So next we're going to talk about insulin pump therapy insulin pump therapy therapy does provide some advantages. The insulin pump really is just a reservoir of insulin that is driven by a pump into an infusion set and is controlled by the  N't. So the insulin pump will deliver a basal insulin and this can be set. Very precisely to accommodate the patients. Diurnal, patterns, and Insulin needs much better than we can do with injected insulin. So that is set. And is, is delivered. Continuously. The bolus insulin is controlled by the patient. So then the pump becomes a calculator where the patient has to  Let the pump know what it, what the blood sugar is, how many grams of carbohydrates they're going to eat and the pump will calculate based on pre-programmed ratios and calculations? How much insulin is needed? What's also nice is that the pumps nowadays will keep track of doses that are still out there. So assuming that a dose of Humalog and novolog a Piedra rapid acting, insulin will last about four hours.  This can be programmed. So that the pump remembers when the last dose was this helps patients to prevent stacking, insulin, and causing hypoglycemia. So some of the reasons that people like to wear pumps, is that it can be more convenient. They can probably get better, blood sugar control just because of the Precision of the basal insulin dosing, the Precision of the bolus dosing and also because of the convenience,  And so they're less likely to miss injections. It's easier to give multiple injections at buffets or times when they eat out when they don't really know what they're going to have in their entire meal.  Certainly, there are some disadvantages to wearing the pump. They are expensive. Most insurance companies will cover an insulin pump but they do require ongoing supplies. And we encourage patients to also have a backup to be able to give themselves insulin. If for some reason the pump fails or something, happens to the infusion set. So there are really three pieces that are required for the insulin pump. One is the infusion set.  Self. Then there is a tubing that leads to a reservoir that patients, fill with insulin and then the pump itself. There's also an increased risk of ketones when patients are on a pump. And the reason for that is that if there is some problem with the pump, in other words, a pump failure. If there's a problem with the insulin delivery, into the infusion set, or a problem with the infusion.  Asian set, the infusion sets are generally little plastic, catheters that sit underneath the skin. You can't see them once they're under the skin. And if they become crimped or bent, the insulin delivery can be interrupted in, this can lead to a lack of insulin, which would be the reason that people would sometimes develop ketones. And the person, the wearer would not know that they had that crimp and that they were not getting the insulin until their blood sugar's were not responding to two.  Insulin itself. So there's a great deal. More of problem solving that goes into trying to figure out what is wrong, when a blood sugar Rises and whether it has to do with the pump, if it has to do with the wrong dose, the wrong carbohydrate, count illnesses and stress. So people who are on pumps, don't have that. Chunk of insulin that sits underneath the skin and delivers, the insulin to them continuously throughout a 24-hour.  Three. Four-hour period people on pumps. Can actually develop ketones really quite rapidly. So just to review why would somebody develop ketones? It could be because the insulins gone bad could be that there's a problem with their pump could be that for some reason they maybe even just forgot to put their pump on. They had a shower they disconnected. They left the house on forgot to connect their pump. So I'm going to show you a couple of the different pumps that are available on.  Market, I think that it requires a fairly Savvy patient to really take advantage of the options that a pump can allow and an experienced provider to help to figure out what the settings on the pump should be. So the last thing I'm going to cover in this segment is lipo hypertrophy, many patients because they do these injections so often get into the habit of injecting into the same area as this can cause scarring.  Gauri scarring, kind of fatty tissue to develop and Insulin does not absorb very well in these areas. So you can see on this picture that in these areas here is where this person has been doing their injections. And so it really can cause some kind of swelling to occur. Those are areas that the insulin probably won't absorb very well. So if you have patients who  You don't seem to be responding well to the insulin that you're increasing the dose is but not really seeing big changes in their blood sugars. That would be the thing to look for. We've gotten into the habit of looking at injection sites at every visit, and you'll be surprised what you find. It's really not that hard to recognize when it's happening and it's a really simple way to improve blood sugar's, pretty rapidly. And so now, let's take a look at some of the  Section Delivery Systems, including the pens and the insulin pumps.  All right. So as I mentioned I'd like to show you some of these insulin delivery devices. So the first is the vial and syringe, everybody has seen that no mystery there. The next thing I'm going to show you are the insulin pumps and then we're going to move to the insulin pens. So this is just a smattering of three of the different pumps that are available out there. There are several others that are also available. So this is the Medtronic version. It is the one that  Be integrated with the CGM. And how this works, is that a syringe is filled with insulin by the wearer that syringe is dropped into the pump, the tubing, then delivers the insulin into the infusion set that the user also inserts into their skin. So every three days that system is changed out and a new set of insulin and Insulin set are put in  So now we're going to look at the insulin pens. There are a couple of different insulin pens. Some are durable where the cartridge is disposed of, but the pain is not, and the others are disposable. So let's look at the the durable. Pain first, when the patient, picks up their prescription from the pharmacy, they will get five cartridges of insulin. In this case. This would be Humalog.  Generally, all of these cartridges are kept in the refrigerator until the patient uses one.  The pain comes apart here.  And the cartridge goes inside.  Attached to that. Then is a pen needle. So there's a paperback.  And that just screws together.  What's nice about these durable pens is that they can dial in half unit dosing. And for people who are in very small doses of insulin that can be helpful. That could be someone who has been newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, who is still making some insulin, or it could be someone who has had diabetes for a very long time who really doesn't need much insulin. So you can see that that's the pen with the needle on it.  Because it's a mechanical device. We teach the patience to do an air test before every dose to make sure that there is insulin flowing. And that the insulin pen needle is primed in order to dial the dose. I'm just going to dial on the bottom here, a couple of units then with the pin-up, right? I'm going to push on the plunger end. I want to see some insulin coming out of that needle. So we teach our patients three drops.  That was one and a half. So let's do that. Again, two more units will want to see at least three drops of insulin. So that's a successful are test. We know that this pin is going to work. Now, we can dial our dose. If you listen to the clicks, you can hear how much insulin you're dialing. This is how very helpful for people who have visual impairments, who can't see a syringe or who have dexterity problems. So if you listen each  Click as a half of a unit.  So, I can count the clicks, but I can also look to see how many units I have. So, I should have two units. We inject at a\",\n",

Foods that contain carbohydrates include breads Pizza fruits fruit juices processed foods dairy products along with many others. If an order for carb counting for a student has received a meeting with the family to discuss carb counting options is recommended. Sometimes the family will choose to be responsible for figuring carb counts of school prepared meals.  And sometimes the students medical provider or nutritionist will want to be involved. Sometimes the school district or school nurse will assist in determining the carb counts for food items. Although the school's Food Service Personnel may be involved in providing certain nutritional information in most cases. They are not experts in Diabetes Care and therefore may be hesitant to provide exact.  of carbs in school prepared meals they are however responsible for providing labels recipes and planned serving sizes when needed  A collaborative approach to carb counting and management of mealtime is the best approach using all the team members strengths to come up with a safe and reasonable plan carbohydrate Counting.  There are several ways to determine the number of grams of carbohydrates in a food item.  You can find the number of grams of carbohydrates by looking at the nutrition label of the food item. It is important to review the serving size on the nutrition label and to know how much of the serving size was actually eaten. If a student was served a different portion than indicated on the label or did not eat the complete serving size. Then a calculation may be needed of what was actually eaten and the total number of grams of  adjusted  Some school Food Service directors use nutrient analysis to determine carb counts of menu items some will provide carb counts on the menus posted for families since this is not available in all districts. It is important to find out what is available in your District.  There are also computer programs or nutrition books that can be used to calculate grams of carbohydrates in food items.  Sometimes the number of grams of carbs will be listed on a cafeteria or food service menu again calculating the serving portion may be needed based on the planned serving size if the student did not eat the entire food item or if the student eight additional servings.  It may be that the students medical provider or dietitian will supply the family with the approximate number of grams of carbohydrates in usual or typical food items eaten on the menu and suggest that these counts be used. Sometimes it may be necessary to review the district's Food Service packaging to calculate serving sizes and grams of carbohydrates.  Self-serve items such as salad bars where students helped themselves to fruits and salad dressings or other condiments can sometimes make it difficult to calculate carbs eaten check with your school nurse to determine the best method for the student you are caring for.  blood glucose and carbohydrate counting in most cases the student with diabetes will need to test his or her blood glucose level before eating make sure to document the students blood glucose level and place the result on any insulin dosing worksheet and or log,  Review the students diabetes management plan to determine how to calculate any blood sugar correction dose.  Carbohydrate counting and Insulin dosing for students with diabetes the management plans should indicate whether the mealtime insulin dose should be given before eating or after eating review. Each student's diabetes management plan and discuss with the school nurse to determine what the plan of care will be for the student you are caring for.  If you will be determining the required insulin dose based on grams of carbohydrates, eaten discuss with the school nurse what the procedure will be to determine the carb count. Will the student bring their food tray to you so you can determine how many carbs were eaten.  Will you use a carb counting app or program to calculate how many grams of carbs were in the meal served and then the student will tell you what they ate.  Will you use the nutrition labels provided by Food Service to calculate the total grams of carbs?  In most circumstances the total number of carbohydrate grams eaten will be divided by a certain number called the insulin to carb ratio to find out how many units of insulin will be needed to cover the carbs eaten. This number may be placed on a mealtime worksheet to help in determining the number of total insulin units needed at mealtime procedure for  hydrate counting and Insulin dosing  Review the students medication administration form the medical provider order form and the parent or Guardian consent form.

I mean, we've all experienced abnormal hair growth at some point in our lives.  Oh, no, it's gray. And while it's normal for us to get the odd hair here. And there today. I want to speak to you about a condition called hirsutism, which is when abnormal hair growth becomes pervasive due to hormonal fluctuations. This is a pain point for many women. So today, I thought I'd give you the nutrition Goods plus a handy. Dandy little face mask that you need to know about. Are you ready? If so, let's do this.  Hey there, I'm Melissa.

Alright, so let's get started.  Added a hirsutism is a condition of unwanted, male pattern hair growth at a flips up to 10% of women that grows in areas where men typically grow hair, the face, the neck, the chest, and even the back. It's generally a result of excess androgens. In other words. Both male sex hormones like testosterone that are produced either in the ovaries or even in the adrenal glands. We see this primarily in women with PCOS who are struggling with  Slim resistance and many women are directed to the theremin Galway chart which according to this, if you are closer to the number 4 then chances, are you have hirsutism?  I mean, this isn't new news, but luckily there are people who are stepping forward to say that they too have facial hair like Adele, for example, it's me. So what can be done? Well, you're in luck. Eating excess carbohydrates like bread, pasta and rice all contribute to  Needed insulin levels, which over time can begin to develop into insulin resistance and hirsutism. So replace those cars with veggies, another type of carbs and make it about fifty percent of your plate and balance your blood sugar by adding in high quality fat and protein.  Thinking of juicing. Well, consider having your green juices instead versus juicing a ton of fruit, which ends up dumping a bunch of fructose. The fruit sugar into your body, from a supplement perspective, add in half a teaspoon of inositol powder at breakfast and a dinner and slowly work. Up to 1 tbsp at both times in all styles.

Begin by adding in 1 tablespoon of chickpea flour into a bowl and one teaspoon of turmeric powder while there are no scientific studies to prove, this turmeric has been used for centuries on the skin. It said to thin the hair and also inhibit hair grow. All you have to do is apply this once daily for a month to get full results. You know, I know what you might be thinking. Won't this make me look like Lisa Simpson?  Nope, the milk used will avoid that from happening. Add in milk to form a paste, then apply, avoiding the eyes and leave it on for 15 to 20 minutes.

I know I was eating things that I shouldn't have and I was really looking for a program that that seemed to make sense West came to the weight Center at Mass General Hospital in Boston to lose weight. And in the process, he was diagnosed with a potentially life-threatening condition called metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is just the tip of the iceberg as those who have it are five times more likely to develop diabetes and two times more likely to develop a stroke or have a heart attack metabolic syndrome is a group of risk factors that include increased waist circumference or belly fat high triglycerides elevated blood pressure high blood sugar in a low HDL or good cholesterol. If a patient has three of these five risk factors a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome is made.  Metabolic syndrome is serious and often hides beneath the surface by that. I mean patients don't know they have it and medical providers. Don't often screen for it. Let me have you stand up and we'll check your waist circumference. Dr. Busch says a larger waistline or central obesity is the most common risk factor for metabolic syndrome and it's often the missing piece of information needed to diagnose the condition. Listen, we measure blood pressure very well. We check cholesterol levels, but we often don't measure ones waste.  Auntie says it should be measured because metabolic syndrome is on the rise in the u.s. Due to the rise in obesity about 35% of Americans almost half of those older than 60 have the condition and the rate is especially high in women and Hispanics, but once diagnosed the risk for metabolic syndrome can be greatly reduced or even reversed by losing just 5 to 10 percent of body weight.

It's a beautiful example of cell signaling going on and like remarkable skin because all those small molecules all those cells and everything that are that are there they're interacting with the help of different cell surface receptors, the interacting by secreting chemokines, which are the signaling molecules the chemical factors. So what happens actually this this receptors the playing very vital role. That is why the name come major  So compatibility complex. So whether this these glycoproteins are distinguished and they are there determine whether a tissue graft will be rejected and it will be accepted. That's why the name came. But now, if you go back to the discussion, what we are talking about all the nucleated cell carries this major histocompatibility complex one, but they're lacking major histocompatibility complex to because MHC Class 2 is only found in  Pigeon presenting cells or apcs and what are the antigen presenting cells in immune system. We know macrophages dendritic cells and B cells. They are known as antigen presenting cells. Why? Because they have a specific function which is very special that if there is a pathogen, they will engulf that pathogen with phagocytosis. Then they will break that pathogen down into small fragments which are known as antigens.  And then showcase that antigen by loading them with a receptor and show them to rest of the immune system cells.  But that receptor where they load this antigen or MHC 1 and MHC 2. That is the job. Right? But all the cells have MHC 1. So if required all the cells can can supply and load the antigen fragments to MHC 1 and so case, but only macrophages dendritic cells and B cells can have MHC 2. So so when they start to fragment the foreign Invader or pathogen and showcase that to rest of the  Cells. Then they will need MHC 2 and they only have that rest of the cells don't have MHC 2. Okay. So now let's talk about this whole process in much more details. The difference between mhc1, you know in the last video if you if you are looking this video and watching this video sequentially, you know in last video we talked about the antigen presentation and we no requirement of both MHC 1 and MHC 2 are important because MHC 2 will help to activate some  Morty cells. So more T helper cells, that will help in bringing more macrophages, more, dendritic cells. So more antigen presenting cells will be bought as well as this this interaction between the antigen presenting cell with the T helper cell with the help of MHC Class 2, molecule can also help in activating the B cells and start producing antibodies. So all these things are brought with the help of MHC 2. But what is the job of mhc1? The  Function of MHC 1 is to designate a specific cell of our body as sick as weak and it will be killed. So there are two options when there is something wrong going on in our body. First thing is that foreign pathogen enters, whether you start to spray it. Now, it is not killing a cell, or it's not damaging the cell then and there, but it's spreading. So what we want, we want to stop the spread of that of that pathogen. So will engulf that pathogen.  Break them down, present them with MHC Class, 2 to the rest of the cells. T cells will be activated. It will further activate, rest of the antigen presenting cells. It will activate the B cells. But on the other hand, if some of our normal body cell is diseased. It's infected and there is no way that disease can be fixed. For example, if it is invaded by viruses and the sale is thrilled with virus particles, which is drawn here with this red dots, let's say those are virus particles.  They completely invade the cell and infect, the cell. There is no way the cell is going to survive in those condition to limit the damage. Sometimes we need to kill our own body cells, to prevent that damage there because if we kill that, sell this disease, cannot be spread to the nearby tissue. So to do that, in that case, those targeted cell or those six cell, they have MHC 1, because all  It is still have that. Mhc1 so they will showcase some part of this component outside those, those fragment of antigens outside or they will sometimes show case the oil duration of lipids in their membrane, which give the signal to the nearby cell which could be natural killer cell or cytotoxic T Cell to. To Guess that that this cell is infected. We need to take an action for example here, if mhc1  Load some part of the fragment of pathogen and showcase outside. So this cell is now very sick. It's showing a flag outside that. I am sick. Please kill me to prevent the damage to the rest of the tissue. So cytotoxic killer cell will come. It will interact with the help of T Cell receptor. With mhc1 loaded with the pathogenic portion. It starts secreting, some chemical factors known as perforins and granzymes that are going to ultimately kill the  target body cell.  These are the job of both MHC 1 and MHC 2. Now another thing I must tell between the the difference between Mac one, and two is that MHC 2 is provided by this dendritic cells or macrophages all these antigen presenting cells. They will interact with CD4 type of T cells. While mhc1 interact with cd8 type of T cells.  CD4 type of T cells are known as T helper cells.  Because the job of this T, helper cell is to activate, some more T helper cells, is to activate basis, is to proliferate macrophages or any other antigen presenting cells while this job of tcd 8. + T cell is known as cytotoxic T-cell. So let me write that side too. Toxic.  Diesel.  So it's toxic for four cells, right? So this cd8 T cells or cytotoxic T cells? So the job of the cytotoxic T cell is to kill the target cell.  Okay, that is a another functional difference between MHC 1 and MHC 2 and how they engage in interaction.  Now if you go in more details about the structural and functional process of and processing of MHC is there are some differences present between them. So, for understanding, I must erase this portion.  And one thing I can tell you is that this MHC 1 MHC 1. It has a structure of. Let me draw it in a very basic drawing of the structure. It has 22 different chain. One is the  Alpha chain.  Which is the proper full Alpha chain, and a partial beta chain?  A partial beta chain. That is the structure of mhc1. But if you look at the structure of MHC Class 2,  here, we have a proper Alpha chain.  Along with a proper beta chain.  Okay, this is the structure.  This is a structure of.  So proper Alpha chain and beta chain together. And here is only Alpha chain and a partial beta chain for mhc1 now how they prepared these structures. Now the thing is inside the cell. So let me draw this whole idea. I'm not going to talk very details, but I'm just going to give an overview of this process. If this is the sell all this processing of antigens and loading. The antigens on this MHC taken place in the endoplasmic. Reticulum. So I am drawing the end.  Has been critical. I'm here.  Let's say these are the regions of endoplasmic reticulum. And  Normally what happens in the cytosol. There are fruity assume proteasome are the giant machines that are present in the cytosol of eukaryotic cell which can break down proteins into smaller fragments. So what happens actually let's say there is an endowment.  Of a pathogen.  So green is the color of the pathogen or bacteria. For example, then go of this bacteria inside after this engulfment. It is released.  So the fragment of, so normally what happens, after this engulfment? This\",\n",

       " 'WpSSVwKYsv0': \"Of artist award for outstanding clinical investigation worldwide. In addition. He has received the Ada's Banting award and the esds Claude Bernard award which are the highest scientific achievement awards given by these prominent Association. Dr. Difonzo is a distinguished, clinician teacher and investigator. And we are happy to have him with us today. So without further Ado, dr. Franz. Oh, thank you very much for that. Very kind.  Invitation and I'd like to welcome all of our listeners. Today. I'm going to review some new Concepts about the role of the kidney in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis and the implications of some of the arrangements that occur in people with type 2 diabetes for the treatment of this, very common metabolic disorder. So let's get started.  And if I can make this slide go.  Okay, there we go. So these are my disclosures in terms of conflict of interest. I have great support from Bristol-Myers Squibb AstraZeneca. Jansen, in particular companies that are involved with some of the newer medications that we will be talking about and I'm a member of the speaker's Bureau for both AstraZeneca and Novo and I participate on a number of advisory boards as shown here.  On this slide. We have come to learn. Now that the kidney plays a very, very important role in the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis, and I've summarized what we have learned in the last decade about the important contribution of the kidney to the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis. First. We know that the kidney is responsible for the production of about 20% of glucose.  That occurs throughout the sleeping hours. And this production of glucose comes, primarily through the gluconeogenesis pathway. And the kidney itself contains very, very little like Asian. We also know that the kidney, utilizes glucose, as an energy source, and if one more to put a catheter in the renal artery in the renal vein, we would see that the net balance across the kidney is 0 indicating that the amount of glucose, which is taken up in utilized by the  Kidney is precisely equal to the amount of glucose, which is produced by the kidney. We also know that the kidney filters about 180 grams of glucose every day and all of this glucose in normal glucose tolerance, individuals is reabsorbed. There are two Transporters, the sglt2 transporter, which is the high-capacity transporter, takes back some 80 to 90% of the glucose. And if it does is job than the sglt2.  T1, transporter, which is the low capacity, High Affinity, transporter, takes back the remaining 10 to 20% of the glucose and we'll talk about the role of these Transporters in more detail. S stands for sodium, GL for glucose T4, transporter abbreviated, therefore sglt2 and SG 0 T1, transporter. Now following an overnight fast. Normal.  Produce glucose from endogenous sources at the rate of about one point, eight milligrams per kilogram body. Weight per minute. This is critically important. Since throughout the sleeping hours. There is no exoticness input of glucose into the body and the brain has an obligate need for glucose. It cannot utilize any other metabolic fuel. Therefore. It's critically important throughout the sleeping hours that organs within the  Body produce glucose to maintain our blood sugar in the range of 80 to 90 milligrams per deciliter. Prior to the last decade. We used to believe that all of endogenous glucose production came from the liver, but we now know that in fact that the kidney is well as the liver contribute to endogenous glucose production with about 15 to 20 percent of glucose production throughout the sleeping hours, coming from the kidney and the other 82.  Five percent coming from the liver. Now. Let's look at the two major hormones, namely insulin and glucagon, which are responsible for the regulation of endogenous glucose production, both at the level of the liver as well as the level of the kidney. Now using created glucose, one can very precisely quantitate the rate of glucose production and that issue.  So here to be about 12 micro moles per kilogram body weight per minute during the fasting State following an overnight fast. And you do not have to rate. Yeah, concerned about the unit's, I what I'd like you to do is just to look what happens when we start a physiologic infusion of insulin to raise the plasma insulin concentration to approximately, what you'd see after a typical mixed meal. You see that at time,  Zero, the basal rate of endogenous glucose production is very quickly and nicely suppressed by this fought physiological, increase in insulin. So what we now? What would like to know is what is the effect? Now, the other hormone that regulates endogenous glucose production is glucagon. And this now shows you following an overnight fast and shown here by -6 during the -  T20 time period the rate of an endogenous glucose production and the effect of a physiologic increase in the plasma glucagon concentration on endogenous glucose production. You can see that very quickly that there's an increase in glucose influx into the body. And as we see here now on the bottom, two slides, there is a very, very different response at the level of  The kidney as opposed to the level of the liver. So all of the increase in endogenous glucose production in response to glucagon is coming from the liver. And the kidney itself actually has no effective response to looking at. Now. I want you to keep this in mind because when we come back and talk about the sglt2 Inhibitors, you're going to see that this differential responses glucagon plays. A very, very important.  Important role in terms of the efficacy of this new class of drugs, the sglt2 Inhibitors. So, let's now look at the role of the kidney in people with type 2 diabetes. What I've summarized for you, here are the rates of Total Renal and hepatic glucose production and non-diabetic individuals from the two previous slide. And what I'm going to show you. Now in the right-hand panel is what happens in people with type 2 diabetes.  Diabetes. So, throughout the sleeping hours. There's a significant increase in the amount of glucose is produced by all tissues in the body and people with type 2 diabetes. And it's this increase in glucose and Dodgers, glucose production, which is responsible for the increase in fasting. Glucose concentration are diabetic patient. Now, you can also see that both the kidney the middle panel as well as the liver contribute to this.  In endogenous glucose production, but from the standpoint of the contributions of the kidney versus the liver, you can see that in diabetics the kidney contributes, a disproportionate amount to this increase in endogenous glucose production. Now, it also should be noted that the fasting insulin concentration in people with type 2. Diabetes is usually elevated two to threefold compared to that in non-diabetic individuals. So what this  This means then is that both the kidney in the liver are severely resistant, to the ability of insulin to suppress glucose production, through the gluconeogenic pathway in both the kidney, in the liver and this over production of glucose because of the insulin resistance in these two organs is, of course, the factor that's responsible for the increase in fasting glucose concentration. So if you were to extrapolate,  This increase in in vaginal glucose production. Both from primarily, from the kidney, you would see that the kidney adds an extra 50 grams of glucose every day to the systemic glucose pool, assuming that the diabetic patient has a hemoglobin A1c of about 8% and mean, plasma glucose of 160, which is not too uncommon for most of the  Take patients that we see in general practice. Now, the other important role of the kidney has, to do with the ability to reabsorb glucose. So in your eye with a gomory, the filtration rate of 180 liters per day in a Min day-long Wilcos of 100 milligrams per deciliter. We filter about 180 grams of glucose. And this is all reabsorb. Now, of course the diabetic and again, this refers to someone with the mean, go  the coast of about 160 milligrams per deciliter, the diabetic filters in excess amount of glucose, in the range of about 250 grams per day. And unfortunately, all of that glucose is reabsorbed so the kidney actually and the diabetic patient has been mailed program. So that when it sees an increase in the filter load of glucose, it actually responds by increasing all of that excess glucose, which has been filtered.  And the net result is returning this glucose to the systemic.\",\n",
       " 'wQ1QGZ6gJ8w': \"Let's talk about this thing called metabolism. I remember being told in medical school that metabolism was the sum total of all of the chemical reactions in the human body, but I never actually knew what that meant. So I like to think of metabolism as kind of like the balance in the body between the reactions that build things up. And another way of saying that is anabolism.  And on the other side of the scale, the reactions that break things down.  And the medical way of saying that is catabolism or catabolism.  So metabolism is kind of the balance between building things up or repairing, or storing inside the body and breaking things down, usually for energy needs. So how are the things that we eat broken down for energy or stored within the body? Let's start by looking at carbohydrates. So we eat are carbohydrates and they are  In the form of starches or sugars and we saw in our last video that those could get broken down into their kind of component parts and that the major component or the major single-unit currency of carbohydrates is called glucose, and that glucose, and this is very big picture can get broken down further.  Into a compound called pyruvate.  And the pyruvate then gets broken down into a very important molecule. That's kind of the center of making energy in the body and that molecule is called acetyl.  Koay.  now I think of acetyl Co a kind of like a little one of those little trampolines, you see in the gym and basically acetyl Co a can be moved around to different parts, will put the trampoline there and then we'll put it over there and then we'll put it over there and basically different chemicals bounce on, and off of that little portable trampoline as they're going around this cycle, and this cycle is called  The TCA cycle that stands for tricarboxylic acid cycle, or it's sometimes called the Krebs cycle. But essentially what you need to know about this cycle is that, as the acetyl co a moves around the cycle to form all of these slightly different compounds, things are bounced off and the things that are bounced off. Are these high energy carriers? I'll just write? Hi.  G carriers.  What happens to the high energy carriers next is that they basically Bounce Down a staircase called the electron transport chain, and as they go down that staircase, they give off a chemical called a tee pee and ATP is the currency.  Of energy in the human body. So ATP is the same as energy in the human body. Now, just to add some detail. Here, water is also given off, and I'll write the chemical formula for water, which is H2O. And in order for this cycle, this TCA cycle to move around, oxygen is required. And  Carbon dioxide CO2 and water again are given off. Oxygen is also necessary for this step to happen. And this is really neat because this is essentially the reason why we need to breathe now, let's look at what happens to the Protein that's in our diet. So protein was one of the three macronutrients that we looked at in the last video, and the proteins in our diet are broken down by our  Digestive tract as we saw into unit parts, called amino acids, amino acids. And depending on what kind of amino acid you're looking at the amino acid, can either enter the system here at this level, or it can enter here, depending on which kind of amino acid it is, and when the amino acid makes this transition, something is given off. And that's  That something is the amino group.  So, the amino group or the a mean, is given off, and that aiming becomes one of the waste products in our urine. So, that's how we get rid of those aiming groups. Let's look. Now at what happens to the fats that we eat in our diet. So that's basically are made up of a little, glycerol backbone. So, I'm going to write here.  Glycerol.  And long chains of what we call fatty acids. There are three of them attached to each glycerol backbone. And what happens when the body needs to use those for energy is that it breaks them down into units of two carbons, each and. All right here fatty.  Acids and those two carbon units can only enter this system over here at the level of acetyl. Co a, whereas this small glycerol backbone goes in over here. So those are the breaking down reactions. That's this side of the equation of metabolism. But what about the building up reactions? Well, the amino acids that come from the  Teen in our diet, can be used to make things like muscle and other lean tissue in our bodies.  They can be used for repair. They can be used as protein carriers in our blood and the carbohydrate that we eat and the glucose in. Our body can also be stored as something called glycogen, which is the storage form of carbohydrate in our bodies, the fats that we've eaten. If there are too many of those in our diet. They can also be stored as adipose tissue. So they're put back together and stored in our body.  And the balance between the breaking down reactions or the catabolic reactions and the building up reactions. The balance is controlled by hormones in our body. So there are several hormones that lead to breaking down of tissues, things like glucagon.  Leads to the breakdown of the stores of glycogen in our body. Other hormones are the the kind of fight or flight hormones epinephrine is one of them.  And glucocorticoids.  These are sort of the stress hormones in our body. And these guys all favor, the breaking down or catabolism of the tissues, the hormones, that lead to the building up or anabolism in our bodies. The major one is insulin. I'm sure you've all heard of it insulin leads to storage or things being put away. There's also a part to be played by the sex hormones or the sex steroids.  And then there are some hormones that are anabolic or favor the building up of proteins. And those are the hormones. Thyroxine.  And growth hormone. I'll just write g h those guys favorite the anabolism or the building up of protein stores. So, protein synthesis is favored by these guys, but they also work on this side. They favor, the breakdown of  Fats and carbohydrates stores, thyroxine and GH growth hormone. Those guys favored the breaking down of our fat and carbohydrate stores.  The last thing I want to add here, is that some of these reactions are reversible. So glucose going to pyruvate can be reversed. It can go back up in the other direction and that's how we can make glycogen from let's say these amino acids that make pyruvate, this kind of amino acid can be used to make glycogen the backbone of the fatty acids called glycerol could be used to make glycogen, or to make glucose to feed the brain. But this reaction  Particular one. Here is an irreversible one-way reaction. So that means that fatty acids can never go up to make pyruvate and be used as glucose for the brain or they can never be used to replenish glycogen stores in the body. And another important thing that we have to understand is that this cycle will only go around if ATP is needed by the body. So if we're using energy, we're doing  Sighs, we're demanding ATP and energy from our system. Then this cycle will continue going around. But if we don't, let's say we're sedentary and we don't use energy then. Acetyl Co a is going to build up and it's going to favor the return in this direction, towards adipose tissue. This is how excess carbohydrate if it's taken in the diet can lead to excess adipose tissue excess fat. If we  Eat too much fat in our diet that can lead to adipose tissue. And even if we eat too much protein, it'll just be deaminated and converted to acetyl-coa, which can be converted to adipose tissue.\",\n",

Walter Kernan, professor of medicine at Yale University and Pi of the iris trial. Welcome old. Thank you. So, we'll jump right into it. Walter. Why did you and your colleagues do this trial? Well, they were years. Even Decades of research. Before we started showing an association between insulin.  Distance and risk for stroke and myocardial infarction. Then, in the 1990s, Along came a potent, anti-diabetes drug, which ameliorated insulin resistance. So, we asked the question, if we use that drug in insulin resistant stroke patients. Could we keep them healthier? Great. And so, what was the design of the study? It was a multicenter randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial? Okay. And what did you find? Well, we found that pile.  His own effectively prevented recurrent stroke and myocardial infarction among patients with a recent ischemic stroke or TI a who were not diabetic, but had insulin resistance. It reduce the risk of recurrent stroke and myocardial infarction by about 24%. What do you think the implications are for clinical practice? Well, I think there are a few implications one, is that the results of our trials? Suggest that pile of litter zone is likely to be an  Option for patients, who have had an ischemic stroke to help them prevent further Strokes in myocardial infarction. Keep in mind, the patients in our study were already receiving. Optimal Medical Care. They were getting their blood pressure controlled and so forth. However, we think it's going to take some time for the scientific community and the stroke Community to consider our results and come to a consensus about how they should be brought into clinical.  Practice with any unexpected findings, or concerns that might have impact on clinical, practice from the study. There were no unexpected findings except perhaps that, we had very little heart. Failure in our study, in previous research on pioglitazone. The drug had been associated with an increased incidence of heart failure. We didn't find that we think that's a result of us selecting patients, who didn't have heart, failure to begin with and also managing patients according to a safety protocol.  We did observe side effects that are reported with pioglitazone. Pioglitazone has been associated with bone fractures. And with weight gain, we observe both of those side effects in our population.

Not only will reversing insulin resistance, improve your blood sugar. It will also improve your overall health. Here are some tips to treat insulin resistance, eat more complex carbohydrates, at least 90 to 95% of the carbohydrates. You eat should be complex. This can help regulate your blood sugar. Try to eat most of your complex, carbohydrates, at lunch and cut down on the portion sizes of other males.  Carbohydrates are found in whole unprocessed foods, like whole grains piece, lentils beans, and vegetables. Cut down processed foods, reduce extra sugars and fats. The tour usually added to processed food. Rather try to eat natural or simply prepared foods cook from starch as often as possible and choose organic foods to avoid chemicals. You should avoid chemicals. If  You are trying to reverse insulin resistance limit, your sugar intake were eating sugars, like glucose, sucrose fructose and high fructose. Corn syrup can increase your risk for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity Sugar. By itself does not cause diabetes but drinking more sugar filled, the beverages is linked to higher blood sugar levels and to an increase the risk of type 2, diabetes, take more fruits and vegetables.  It's don't think that you have to avoid fruits because they are sweet. You should take your variety of fruits and vegetables to get nutrients. Your body needs since the sugars in fruits are combined with the fiber, your body will slowly absorb the sugar. Try to eat fruits and vegetables with the peel. So you get more fiber, drink, lots of water. You should also increase the amount of water. You drink The Institute of Medicine.  It's the to drink one to two liters or about six to eight ounce glasses per day. Add more fiber, good sources of fiber include Brands beans, berries, whole grains, vegetables and seeds. Some Fiber like flax seeds. Also contains a good amount of omega-3 fatty acids, research shows that increasing your insoluble, fiber intake, along with whole grains, can reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

EA is an antioxidant that keeps blood glucose levels stable. It also stimulates blood flow and can never damage caused by high blood sugar. Take 300 2000 mg of alj every day. L-Carnitine is another antioxidant that can repair nerve damage caused by high blood.  Take healthy fats, your body needs fat to function efficiently healthy fats, like omega-3 fatty acids evening primrose oil, and flaxseed can all reduce inflammation caused by high blood sugar levels.

Amino terminal position in activating is substrates and the key substrates are glp-1 and Gip  Then there's a rapid and efficient metabolism by dpp-4 that makes the half-life of glp-1, very short. Then when we inhibit this DPP Force, we made the have life of glp-1 of natural, glp-1 much longer in creating this function in type 2 diabetes. We have known for a long time that there is an increase in effect.  When people receive insulin and an oral glucose load versus an intravenous glucose infusion, the action of insulin is totally different when we give an oral glucose load or when we eat insulin secretion is significantly higher than when we give an intravenous glucose infusion, and that's what we call the encrypted effect in patients with type 2 diabetes. This increase in effect is significantly diminished and that  Why in real life, we see a failure of insulin secretion in the first place. And that's what we call the increase in effect, the difference between the insulin secretion after an oral glucose load, Which is higher versus an intravenous glucose infusion, which is much lower. And that in patients with type 2, diabetes is impaired. We also have data, you know, sometimes data is confusing, but we have data from 12 Nielsen in the journal.  Clinical endocrinology and Metabolism showing that postprandial GOP. One levels in patients with intolerance and type 2. Diabetes are significantly. Decrease normal glucose tolerance is higher. When we have a patient with impaired glucose tolerance is lower and we have a patient with type 2 diabetes even lower than before and you can see that really clearly in this slide is to strategies for glp-1 enhancement.  How can we enhance GOP one where we can actually administer a GOP? One animal? This are chemically modified GOP, one not susceptible to dpp-4 metabolism. So, this agents have a longer Half-Life and a higher ILP. One level, FDA-approved extended idid extended dies, once weekly and regular side and some new ones in the foreseeable future like a big one side. Listen.  That died and the logotype. All these agents have to be given as an injection into the subcutaneous tissue, dpp-4, Inhibitors block the dpp-4. So that it Blends the breakdown of GOP. One, it races and Dungeness GOP one levels and also Gip. Remember what I told you before, without that, the dpp-4 enzyme degradation will be one in a very short period of time. Listen to me.  Minutes with this drought. We enhance the GOP, one levels and the time of action if they approve out of Lipton, linagliptin saxagliptin and see that written and will that Lipton has been approved. Outside the US, they may be ordered DPP force in the foreseeable future. The advantage is this, our oral Administration. We already talked about the mode of action of the dpp-4 Inhibitors and again, if  Remember, you know, this enzyme in activates glp-1 very quickly, then if we inhibit the dpp-4, we actually amend Lucas, depending insulin secretion when he was glucagon secretion and the fatty glucose production and we improve hyperglycemia. This is a selective innovation of the pp for that increases plasma glp-1 levels resulting in the resumption of local levels.  DP / for Univision improve glp-1 levels. There are several studies. In this particular one would see that lifting 25 and Civic groups in 200 in an oral glucose tolerance test. We see a significant increase of active glp-1 compared to Placebo, where the possible increases entitled models about 75 moles at two hours to three hours. The use of siddig Lipton increases it.  Been 15 and 20 with the 25 and 200 milligram dose and it remains higher for about six hours. Linagliptin has also a very nice effect on GOP. One and on working. In this particular study. They're significantly statistically difference in postprandial intact glp-1, which increases and glucagon that decreases versus placebo after four weeks of treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes.  Then in the left hand side, you see the nice increase in glp-1 and in the right hand side, you see the nice decrease in glucagon and this is a day 28 and this is after the administration and looking H, the biggest effect is in one and a half hours and it continues for the duration of the study in this study, actually three hours.  Now we're moving to the turbo, terrific effect of GOP. One in patients, with type 2 diabetes. In this particular study, 10 patients, fully control, with type 2 diabetes with Steve infusions of glp-1 or Percy, go. And what we saw is that with the GOP, one. We saw a significant increase in phone, 17.4 animals and the c-peptide increase 228 animals, the GOP one significantly reduced.  Fasting. Plasma glucose actually in this particular study because it's an infusion. Normal levels were rich in all patients. The pancreatic will consecration was decreased by 1418 bags. Almost / 1 per minute and the plasma non-certified fatty acids were decreased by 26.3 mmol also per minute. Now, we're moving into, glp-1 receptor Agonist and dpp-4 Inhibitors, and we're going to show the effects on.  A1C glucose and insulin levels. We're going now to talk about extended time and the beneficial effects on fasting, plasma glucose and Insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes. In blue, you have possible and in these different shades of pink to purple. You have a senate. I do those and the dark is is extended eyes at a higher dose. When you look at me in fasting, plasma glucose, you're seeing that there is  is a significant Improvement in three and four hours pose those. And the most important is the for oppose. Those is actually close to normal with the point one.\",\n",
       " 'X2o_Z6hOpwo': \"I don't mean by age. I mean by history. Okay, and one of the original retina practices in the world for that matter and there's a bunch of us. We all do Ophthalmology. Take care of diabetes. Do lots of retina things like macular degeneration. And we have three offices. You're on our main office of 57 and park. We have a Brooklyn office on your Kings Highway and then we have a White Plains office about a mile north of White Plains.  Okay, so disclosures. I'm a consultant to Bausch & Lomb. I do some speaking for Genentech, partial AMA regeneron. I've absolutely no financial interest in anything. I'm about to speak to you about.  So, here's a common conversation that I run into, when I sit down with their brand new diabetic. Patient that walks into my office. Not everyone. But this is a common conversation. Okay, here it goes.  They say to me. I have a touch of diabetes that sound familiar to anyone here. Yeah. All right. Borderline. I don't know. I'm pre-diabetic. It's this big gray area. Okay.  When I asked him, how the sugars are doing, this is what I get 99% of the time. I sugar was normal this morning. Okay. Well, I've learned a lot. Okay. I don't know what that means. I honestly don't.  What do hemoglobin A1c? That's my question to them?  What's that?  To the credit of New York City's Board of Public Health, whatever that is, that probably tried to want to do the soda ban and all that stuff, which I thought was a great idea by the way. Every now and then a couple years ago on phone booths in New York when they still existed maybe on the side, the bus stops. Now there was a public health campaign that actually said it has something. What about know your A1C? Anyone see that? Remember seeing that I was so impressed when I saw that because I was the first time anyone I've ever heard anyone publicly speaking about that in a public forum. So, but a lot of people have no idea what that is.  No idea. And I'm going to tell you why knowing that number is important in how plays into a lot of things that affect your eyes.  I say they say, they exercise, I say you exercise and they say, yes, and I look at them and they're inevitably 30 pounds overweight.  They say they have a little bit of foot numbness.  They say they see fine.  What was the last time you had your eyes examined? I asked, I had my glasses check. Two years ago. Now. What's different there than what I asked. Yeah, glasses glasses. Check is not an eye necessarily. An eye exam, Trevor. This is the common conversation. Okay, who's taking care of your diabetes?  I don't know his or her name.  He or she tells me everything's okay.  I don't know why I have to see you. They say to me.  And I just need reading glasses. This is the common conversation guys. I dilate the Rye. I look inside. Now. You're going to see soon. What a normal retina. Looks like. I'll tell you that. This is a retina that's got massive, scarring and massive problems from diabetes like to the nth degree. Their vision is not surprisingly from here, regardless of this Trainwreck that is going on 20/20.  And they have no idea that they're on the verge of going blind in. This is a common thing. So the take home message, if you all decide to zone out from here, sleep, check your phones, whatever you want to do. Here's the take home message and listen to this any blood sugar problem. I don't care if it's your pre-diabetic diabetic, type one type two, whatever it is. You need to have a dilated eye examination immediately. If you have not had one with an ophthalmologist or retina specialist, not just an  Just for glasses, check things like that. We're talking about dilated eye exam, the type that you're blurred for 5 hours afterward. That kind of eye exam. Okay.  You do not just need an eyeglass check.  Okay, it's beyond that has nothing to do with glasses.  You can have massive eye disease and have absolutely no symptoms at all.  Don't rely on our pill Society. It is easy to take a pill for everything today. You can take a pill. If you're sad. You can take a pill, if you're happy. You can take a pill for anything, and we rely on about a lot of that, right? It's much harder to change your behavior.  Because it's hard to change. Behavior, me included. Okay, and I don't think I have anything on the last bullet here. But diabetes is one of those things that can definitely. And I'm not saying this to scare you, diabetes is one of those things that can cause complete blindness. It just is macular degeneration, everyone, ever heard about that. That's another big problem in our society. Lots of problems Mega generation might cause you to lose your Straight Ahead Vision, but Mac degeneration is not cause you go pitch black blind. Diabetes can cause you to go pitch black blind.  Okay.  Take good care of yourself. And again, this is hard to do. It's hard enough for me to do it. Okay, now I'm a physician.  Exercise weight loss. Eat. Well, don't smoke.  Some of that stuff. Sounds really easy. Some of the stuff is the hardest stuff in the world to do.  So moving into more, diabetes, diabetes, as you all know who have diabetes can affect your whole body. Okay, we're going to be talking mostly about the I tonight, but I want to give credit to the entire body. It affects the, I we call that diabetic, retinopathy. It affects the kidneys. It's called diabetic nephropathy. It can affect the nerves, what we call diabetic, neuropathy. It, increases the risk of stroke coronary heart disease, whole body disease, and there's lots of different problems that need to be.  Looked at. So here's the thing about diabetic retinopathy. When we start now, focusing more towards the eye, for the rest of this lecture, the busy slide, ignore it, except for the green at their first study. Visit 83 percent of patients with diabetic retinopathy, which means stuff going on in the eye but 80% of them with vision threatening retinopathy meaning that they could lose vision at any moment, eighty-three percent of them, had no idea that any vision problem whatsoever.  That's huge. That goes to my first slide of there was a problem there, but you didn't know you had it. If you have diabetes type 1 and diagnose, usually at a younger age. You should have an eye exam within three to five years of diagnosis and thereafter every year. If you're diagnosed with type 2, hear this clearly. Okay, 99.99% Chance, you've had type, Diabetes Type 2 for longer than the time that that you just found out about it. Okay, which means it's been going on for a longer. You need to get in immediately for full diet. I dilated eye exam with  And week or two or a month at the most finding out you have that because the chances of you already having I findings as high because it's been going on for longer than you just finding out about it. And then if you have nothing, they find your eye, doctor says, everything looks good at a minimum once a year. You need to have your eyes dilated. It may be more frequent. If you are found to have certain findings and need to be managed and monitored more carefully, okay?  So we look at the risk factors for what we call, diabetic, macular edema, and I apologize for not spelling this out. We're going to talk about this later on but diabetic macular edema, which we'll get into in a minute, is one of the most common reasons why people don't see what which is, where the retina, which is the back part of the eye. That's like the film of a camera. We're going to go through all this in a second. Get swollen. Okay. So it's a one of the most common reasons why people diabetes don't see well, okay.  What's the risk factors for that? How long you've had diabetes the longer you've had diabetes, the more out of control, your blood sugars are at the more likely you are to run into any of these problems. We're talking about kidney problems, include it, numbness in your feet included.  So, if you had diabetes for greater than 10 years or 11 times more likely to have that problem. Secondly, the A1C this gets into why you should know your A1C for many reasons, but this is one of them. For every one point increase above normal and normal is around five and a half. Okay? Just for argument's sake.  So people come in and say I have anyone say a date. What does that mean? Well, normal, five and a half. Okay. Well, let's just say it's five, just for purposes of argument sake, so you're more ornate, that's three points above normal for every one point above normal, the chances of you having this problem go up 50%. So if you are running an eight, your chances of having a diabetic macular edema is guess what? If I'm doing my math, right 3 times 50 is 150 percent. I see patients walking into email going agencies of 6, 14 or 15. So, what's that?  That's 10 might even though right? Ten ten times. That's a 5000 or whatever it is. You get the point. I can't do my math. It's a large number for everyone points. You've got to control your A1C. You need to know what your A1C is. All right, so that number needs to be controlled, obviously, controlling high blood pressure, high cholesterol, all the things that you would think of normally to control to protect for heart disease of the same, things need to be controlling protecting for macular retinopathy.  Alright. Now we're going to get into the nuts and bolts of it. I'm going to assume that most of you don't know why anatomy and you'll thank me for that. Okay, because otherwise you would be lost for the rest of the lecture, which is not an uncommon thing for lectures to do. So, here it is. Here's a camera. Now I'm talking old fashioned cameras. I'm not talking about the iPhone camera is I have no idea how that works. I don't. But I'm talking about, old-fashioned film camera and everyone in this room. Not calling anyone in this room old, but I like photography and I grew up with phone camera. So I know pretty much looking around. Here is no one here. That's  At least younger than I am. So you all know what film cameras look like, right? Okay. So here's a fill an old SLR camera and I have way a camera work is the lens. Does what? Two choices? Okay, good focuses. The lens of the camera, focuses light onto the what?  The film. If the lens is out of focus, the picture on the film is out of focus. Okay, if you have the most expensive, beautiful Focus lens in the world on your camera, but you have rotten film.  How else that picture going to come out?  Right. All right. There it is. That's diabetes. Okay, we're going to get into that. Here's your eye. You have the front part of your eye, which, and I can spend a whole lot getting into, but you have your, What's called the cornea, and then you have the lens, the lenses of thing that becomes a cataract over time. And guess what? These two things are responsible for doing. They're sort of like the lens of the camera. They are responsible for focusing light on to the back wall of the eye, which is where I think called the retina is located, which is the same thing as the film.  And in the here's the light coming in as focused. Okay, and the retina is a very very part of your brain. Okay, it's nerve.\",\n",
       " 'X2rOWkOcq9I': \"First question is an anti hyperlipidemia check that reduces ldls by decreasing, are endogenous, cholesterol production. Is that a are HMG co-reductase? Inhibitor atorvastatin brand name? Lipitor, be fabric acid. Our fennel fibrate. Brand name Tricor see nicotinic acid brand niacin, or D bile acid sequestrants Cola several, Am brand well call.  That's going to be our tour of a Statin or are HMG co-reductase inhibitor. So are Statin medications are specifically going to work to decrease our endogenously cholesterol production to reduce our ldls and Dad. Dennis, just means that it's what our body naturally produces. So our statins usually are going to be given at night time and that's because our body naturally makes its cholesterol in a state of fasting which usually occurs.  We're sleeping. So they're going to have their most benefit at nighttime. It's not going to be our fennel FIB rate because that's going to be focusing on decreasing our vldls or our triglycerides. It is not see nicotinic acid because that is going to work on increasing HDL or good cholesterol and it's not. Decolo, several am are bile acid sequestrants. While this category also reduces ldls. It's going to do so by decreasing our X.  Ah, genus cholesterol absorption from the gut verses are endogenous or our bodies, natural cholesterol production.  Next, we're going to work on making be correct. So our fabric acids, so we have the most effective drug for lowering triglyceride levels and has an increase on increasing HDL levels, which is our good cholesterol. That's going to be our fennel FIB rate. It's going to be the most effective in lowering our vldls or triglycerides while or atorvastatin and are nicotinic acid. Both do reduce our vldls. It's going to do so moderately.  Going to have the most benefit with our fabric acid, derivatives and cola. Several am and are bile acid. Sequestrants is really just focusing on lowering, our LDL level.  This question is going to make C correct or a nicotinic acid. So which medication causes intense skin flushing and is most effective in elevating HDL levels. So that's going to be our nicotinic acid. This class is specific on increasing our HDL or good cholesterol, but one of the side effects is that it can cause some skin flushing. So patients, that are taking nicotinic acid or nice and oftentimes will take aspirin alongside with it to reduce the side effects.  While our atorvastatin and our fennel FIB rate, I have moderate HDL increase. When we're really focusing on increasing our HDL levels of they're really low. Nicotinic acid is going to be the Mainstay of therapy, and it's not again, our call several am are a bile acid sequestrants because that's really going to be focusing on. Decreasing are exogenous LDL from the gut.  So this last question here is going to be focusing on making D. Correct? Arcola sevelamer a bile acid sequestrants. So which medication should be avoided with fat-soluble vitamins as it acts on inhibiting cholesterol absorption from the gut, that's going to be our bile acid. Sequestrants specifically, call us several am in this, in this case, so that this is going to work in our gut to decrease our ldls by decreasing our fat absorption. So  While we're in inhibiting, our fat absorption, this can be detrimental for patients. That are also taking fat-soluble vitamins, because it can inhibit the absorption of those as well. Our atorvastatin while it's going to decrease our LDL production or decrease our ldls. It's going to do so by decreasing or LDL production are endogenous LDL and then our fennel FIB rates are going to be mainly focused on decreasing our triglycerides and our nicotinic acid. Mainly going to be focusing on increasing.  In our HDL or are good cholesterol.\",\n",
       " '6JGB8sTvUw': \"Or at least soft nib that give you some pretty good line variation and I get into a little bit showing you how one it varies from another. It's not the most comprehensive video in the world, but it's better than anything. I've put out so far regarding all these different nibs. So I think that you'll enjoy it, check it out. So I'm really happy today because my fingers are nice and Inky, this is when I feel really good. First. I want to thank up and show you is the noodlers Ahab. So this is the same nigga that's on the noodlers Conrad as well. Performance is pretty similar to the noodlers nib creeper.  All these pens. I'm kind of lumping them into the same thing kind of having representative of this one. And yeah, it definitely looks like, I don't know how to handle some ink. I've been cleaning out a lot of pens and taking them apart and so on that's why it's so bad. This isn't just from filling. I promise. I'm competent with a pen. But anyway, so noodler is Ahab. So it's a stainless steel nib.  Well, that's not supposed to be in a whatever you get the idea noodlers Ahab. So it's got some good line. Very oh my gosh. Can't freaking spell. Okay, but it's got some good line variation. So the thin lines are really fairly thin and then when you write down, you give it some good pressure. You can get some really good variation. So I mean it's a twenty dollar pain. It's had, you know, it's been around for a couple of years. It's been received pretty well. There are some people that have issues of pain can be a little finicky.  You know, even I've part of the reason, my fingers, are you feel like this? Is because I had to adjust the name and feet a little bit. You might have to heat set them every now and then but you know, it's a twenty dollar pain. Like it's going to take a little bit of tinkering. People are looking for the Ahab. Definitely don't expect it to be like perfect every time, a lot of them are fine and they're they don't need a lot of tinkering, but if it does need that, don't be completely surprised, you know, so I'm using noodlers Black by the way, as my ink of choice today. It's just the most  Familiar one that I've had Drew, my customer care manager. He's a big fan of flex pens. He actually, prefers Heart of Darkness and all of his Flex Pay ends. He's found that to be just the ink that performs kind of the best all-around and his opinion. But anyway, so this gives you a little bit idea of the performance of the noodlers Ahab. So, that's what I wanted to show you. Is the pilot Falcon this pens been around for a number of years, but this one is actually the soft extra fine version, which hasn't been around that long, but that's what I'm going to show.  You just because it gets the most line variation.  Now, I personally am not as big of a fan of the way that this nib feels. It is a lot finer, you know, it's a Japanese pen.  It does give good line variation, but it's it's sacrifices a little bit in the smoothness.  Especially when you're actually doing the flexing. So it's it does get you a finer line. Then the Ahab does. And when you Flex it out, it doesn't Flex out quite as broadly as the Ahab does. So you really don't want to overdo it with this pen. That's tough. Because this one, there's a lot of videos out there on YouTube and stuff like that, that show people really kind of going nuts. And some of the videos, specially some of the ones that have gone viral show pens that have been modified. So,  You know, be careful when you're doing this in set your expectations properly, but you'll see if you're trying to write with this Falcon, you get a thinner line. It's not maybe quite as broad as drastic as the a ham. But if you want to write small, you know, this is the one to do. So, I'll give you some x's here.  Bam, okay. I should put in here, SEF.  They're so for me, personally, not as enjoyable of a writing experience just because it's not quite as smooth. The soft. Fine is significantly better though. It's really just that extra fine that I find to be kind of cumbersome. And then the next thing I'm going to show you in here is the noodlers. Neponset because this pain has kind of recently come out. And this one is, you know, really gotten Lobster dot. We've only ever had one shipment of them, but I thought it would be good to kind of show you what's going on with.  It. So, this is definitely a broader really wet pain, really wet. Okay.  The name is actually fairly smooth. So I got no complaints there, but you can see in comparison to the Falcon. It's just, like, not quite the same kind of pain. So, this is about the thinnest line. You're going to get, you know, about a probably medium nib, maybe even closer to a broad. But then, when you want to flex this thing out, see, I'm running a little dry. I didn't check to see if I haven't filled this thing in a couple of days.  Here we go.  This thing is an ink monster.  So it definitely consumes some significant tank and I'm having some flow issues. You know, this is just not super uncommon to the playground with it. I honest to goodness have not played with the Neponset quite as much as maybe I would have liked to, but let me prime it up a little bit.  Sorry, I know I'm doing all this off camera.  Give me a sec.  Okay.  So when it's primed up properly, you can get an insane linewidth out of this thing. So it's definitely not going to be like an Everyday Writer. Unless you're writing, really large on very kind of ink resistant paper, but you can see it's almost more like a paintbrush. You know what I mean? Just like the line variation that you get on this thing and the dry time is going to be insane because this thing just dumps more ink than any pain that I've ever seen.  But there you have it. It's just crazy. How broad it gets how wet. It gets. It'll probably be drawing for the rest of this video, but that's not upon sit, you know, and it was even a little finicky in this video here. So I'm not trying to hold too much and make you seem like everything's perfect. That one will take a little bit of tinkering as well. It's a 75 dollar pain, you know, the new lose they have 20 bucks, the Falcons 144 and the Nepal.  It that 175. So it's not about the price though. Necessarily. I mean the price, there's so many different factors when it comes to price with these pens that it's really not just about, you know, so if I spend more money, I'll have a better Flex pain per se. There's a lot of different factors going on, but I'm just trying to at least show you how they write. So, you get some idea if the price is worth for you. The next one I have here. This is a stipules splash. I've been intending to do a video on this one. Haven't gotten around to it yet. So this is kind of the first for a I've ever had.  This pain is a lot smaller and it's a clear body demonstrator kind of thing. The nib is definitely smaller on this pen then on the other pens, but let me show you how it rides.  So this pain has, what's this, a stainless steel pan? It has what's called their their v-flex. They have a tea Flex, a titanium Flex Nim, which if I thought about it, could end up for this video. But, oh, well, it's too late. Now. This one is called their v-flex. So it's, they're stainless steel. I don't know what the v stands for honestly, but you can see, it's got some variation. It takes more writing pressure. And of course, now, it's skipping out on me. You're noticing that this is kind of a trend with a lot of flex payments, but  I'm going to fast probably but it's it's got some decent variation to it. You know, it's not too bad. It's going to be somewhat similar to the Ahab except. This one does not have an Ebonite feed. So it's it's struggling to keep up a little bit. A little bit with me here. You know, this is one that the ink will be a little bit finicky depending on your ink choice. So you'll have to play around to kind of find out what it is and writing slower. Definitely helps.  But there's no heat setting or anything that you can do with this one.  This pan is $64. So it's, you know, kind of right in that range like around the Neponset and all that.  It's breaking up just a little bit.  but,  This one I've had kind of mixed, you know, experiences with personally. This is kind of on the worst end of what I'm normally seeing. So probably not representing as well as it could. But, you know, this is the real, this is what I'm experiencing right in this moment. I could take it, or Tinker around with some more practice a little more and it would be better, but that is what is capable on these tubular Splash. And then the last one I have here is the Oma so jeeva, Alba with the  14-karat extra-fine extra flex subida. And this one is definitely the most expensive out of the bunch. It's $500, but I don't want you to think that because it's $500, you're going to get necessarily 25 times, the benefit of a new Learners Ahab. There's a law of diminishing returns when it comes to fountain pens, just like there is with everything. There's a lot of other things going on with this pain, already explained kind of what this pain has going on in several other Aromas videos, but in  Terms of how it writes, how it flexes out. Thought I would show you here.  This one I'm having to really control myself because all of these other pens. Take a good amount of pressure to write the Falcon, not quite as much because it is a gold nib. All the steel ones. You got are really press on them. You know, that's just how they are. But this pain really doesn't take a lot of pressure.  I'm just going to write 14. Kef. I'm not going to read out extra flexible so I can have all of the samples kind of next to each other. So you can see the line with here on the extra. Fine is pretty comparable to the Falcon its finer than all the other ones and then flexing it out. I don't want to flex this thing out crazy because I am really not putting a lot of pressure on here. You know, it's going to flex.\",\n",

       " 'Xa--z2elP2c': \"Hello, my name is Jess apart. I'm studying for my Master's Degree in Christ bio and brain. Engineering department. Today's lecture subject is diabetes and it is summary of lecture or flow faster, higher Kim. The pancreas is an organ located across the bay.  Back of the abdomen behind the stomach. The pancreas is made up of two types, of tissue. The axial, current issues Secrets, digestive enzymes. These enzymes are secreted into a network or product that join the main pancreatic duct, which runs the length of the pancreas. The endocrine tissue which consists of the islet of langerhans, secret hormones into the bloodstream.  Long cells in islet of langerhans. Beta cell, secretes a hormone which name is insulin. Insulin causes cells in the liver skeletal muscles and fat tissues to absorb glucose from the blood diabetes mellitus or simply diabetes is a group or metabolic disease in which a person has high blood sugar either because the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or  because cells do not respond to the insulin. That is produced.  This high blood sugar produces the classical symptoms of polyuria, which means frequent urination polydipsia, which means increased thirst, and polyphagia, which means increased hunger.  To diagnosis of diabetes. Generally, three tests are youth of fasting, plasma glucose test measures blood glucose in a person who has not eaten anything for at least 8 hours. This test. This test is used to detect diabetes, and pre-diabetes on oral glucose tolerance, test Majors blue, blood glucose after person fast, at least, eight hours.  And two hours. After the person drinks or glucose containing beverage. This test can be used to diagnose, diabetes, and pre-diabetes or random plasma glucose. Test also called a casual plasma glucose test measures blood glucose without regard to when a person being tested last eight, this test along with, on assessment of symptoms, is used to diagnose.  Diabetes. But not prediabetes.  There are four types of diabetes classified by the cause of diabetes. Diabetes Type 1 widget from Bethel destruction, reading to Absolute insulin deficiency. Mostly due to T-cell mediated autoimmune attack, approximately 10% of diabetes in North America and Europe. Type 2 diabetes is known as caused by insulin resistance combined with relative insulin deficiency.  It is most common form of diabetes. Gestational diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy because of relatively inadequate, insulin, secretion and responsiveness, other specific type of diabetes are caused due to other factors. For example, disease of exocrine pancreas.  Among these four classes of diabetes. In this presentation. We will focus on type 2 diabetes, which is most common form of diabetes for a decays people, believe the cause of type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance, which mainly caused by obesity, what recently reported experimental results, suggest that type 2 diabetes is actually better disease.  First recently developed the molecular biology, we build our genes, which correlate to type 2. Diabetes are, mainly expressed in better cell, not muscle or fat cell.  It means the genetic problem of type 2 diabetes are not related to glucose of taking but insulin synthesizing in bit Battlefield and the second velocity dependent permanent insulin. Secretion. First paste is disappear. In type 2 diabetes, patient.  After the several study about relation between diabetes and parasail, people found that type 2 diabetes caused by beta cell failure as people growing up. Insulin resistance is increased by several reasons, such as lifestyle, genetic Factor diet, and obesity basically increase the insulin resistance. Do not directly cause diabetes, because those compensation by  Insulin secretion, but after over threshold Bethel will not withstand 00 below or and Insulin secretion level decreased deadly. This phenomenon called beta cell failure and it shows type 2. Diabetes is disease or insulin deficiency.  The reason why beta cell failure happen is decreased or Barrister mass in normal case, better cell mass increases with the AG, which is related to insulin resistance when people become obesity to compensate, increasing insulin resistance beta cell Mass. Also increase.  But in the case of type 2 diabetes, better service May grow slightly in the early stages, but rapidly reduce. After that. Interestingly in this graph, pregnancy show dramatic change in beta cell Mass during very short time. So people sold pregnancy is good Target or studying battle cell Mass variation during pregnancy. Insulin resistance is developed in  Other to supply enough nutrition to feed us to compensated. Several changes occur in butter Battlefield. After pregnancy as times goes by glucose stimulus, insulin secretion increases maximum 12 volts and during pregnancy better cell proliferation also increases,  To figure out the molecular mechanism of these unusual phenomenon during pregnancy researchers to mRNA deep sequencing. They compare Global gene expression of eyelet between pregnant and non-pregnant mouth. As a result. They found several different really Express the genes and focused on tph one gene, which encodes rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of Serotonin.  In conclusion, third tuna, labor increases in Paris, L, during pregnancy. By high expression of TPA genes at this moment. We can assume that serotonin is related to our deputation or beta cells during pregnancy after several cell and animal experiment. Researchers found the molecular mechanism of how serotonin increase insulin level by affecting Bellefleur matter.  Listen first be a serotonin 2A receptor throat, own in increased. The beta cell proliferation. It causes insulin. Level rise by increasing mass or beta cells. Which secrete insulin s via serotonin 3B receptor. Serotonin induced depolarizing shift or membrane potential by increasing inward background current it leads to decreased.  Glucose has threshold for insulin secretion by increasing membrane excitability. So under these circumstances initially easily secret till to blood, finally. I will briefly summary this presentation with three sentences. First type 2, diabetes is better cell disease second during pregnancy. Better cell-based variation is similar to type 2 diabetes progress.  Finally third tuning, regulate pancreatic beta cell during pregnancy. I hope that this presentation may help you understanding about type 2 diabetes. Thank you for listening.\",\n",
       " 'z5ftvZCyI': \"Now that we've touched on all of the major players in the specific immune system. What I thought I would do in this video is kind of do a summary, so it all fits together a little bit. So the first person or character, we got exposed to as the B cell which always do in blue, the B cell, right? Like that. And what made that interesting is that it every B cell has its own specific or they have membrane bound antibodies.  But for each b-cell, the membrane bound antibodies on each specific b-cell had its own variable portion. So this B cell little be variable, right? Like that variable like that. And if, if I were to draw another Visa, alright, here, I would draw the variable portion a little bit different. And this, why, this is why different actual B cells will respond to different, antigens or different. Pathogens that have entered our system at a B cell. Gets activated. It needs to get. Let me  Let me write all this down actually. So if we're talking about a B cell.  To get activated. So let's talk about what happens when it gets activate or what needs to happen. So activation.  It needs binding of the pathogen onto one of these membrane bound antibodies. So binding.  Of pathogen or maybe call it a mutagen or antigen and to Jin, but that's not all. I mean, sometimes that's, that's all you need. But usually, you also need to be stimulated by T Cell. So T helper T, cell stimulation.  And you might say, where is the helper T cell stimulate this guy? Well, B cells were also antigen presenting cells. So he'll suck this guy in, break them out and present him on an MHC 2 complex. So that's an MHC. Let me do it someplace where I can draw a T-cell coming in. Well, let's say this is an MHC 2 complex. This guy gets cut off part of him gets presented right here and then activated helper T cell and activated helper T cell whose  Verbal portion of their T-cell, respond receptor specific to. This could come along, could come along and activate this character. I'm not drawing that receptor well, but this is a that right. There is a helper T cell and that is the B cell. Now once it's activated, it starts differentiating and it differentiates, it starts cloning itself, and it could either turn into effector cells.  And this is true of B cells or T cells. Once they get activated. They either the keep cloning the either turn to effector cells or memory cells memory cells, stick around a lot longer so that in the future you're going to have many more of this version of b-cell. So if you get the same antigen or pathogen in the future, the likelihood of it, bumping into this type of b-cell is going to be higher. So the response will occur faster. The effector B cells, effector, B cells.  Produce, they essentially turn into and antibody making machines. So they'll say gee this antibody bonds to this antigen that we have in the system. Now, let me just produce a ton of them. So it starts building up all of the cellular machinery and it just starts producing antibodies like crazy. And I want to point out one thing that my wife pointed out to me, when I was, she overheard me making the last video and she's a fellow and hematology and part of a lot of hematology Immunology. So I  We have to defer to her. She is the expert on this. Well, in the last video, I kind of, you know, very hand-waving Lisa. Do, you know, B cells once they get activated, if they're the effector B cells, they produce antibodies. I want to be very clear. It is only the effector B cells that produce the antibodies and the common term for them, the common term for them. If someone were to walk up to you and say, what what cells in the body are producing antibodies. You wouldn't be wrong. If you said effector B cells, but the common term that people expect to hear.  Here are plasma cells.  Plies, my cells, plasma cells, and effector B cells are the same thing. But normally when they say, what happens to a b-cell, when it starts producing antibodies, they then call it a plasma cell. They don't call it a b-cell anymore. And I want to make that very clear because my wife is like, well, I have attendings that if they ask me, what what cell in the body produces antibodies. And if you said B cell, they would say no wrong. It's a plasma cell or Unity said, effector B cell. They wouldn't be happy. They wanted to hear plasma cell. That's this is the common term used in Immunology.  And apparently he and, and apparently Rheumatology Circle did I, to tell my say, my wife is a hematologist? No. No, she's studying, Rheumatology. I get confused with all the apology sometimes. Anyway, that's what the B cells doing. These antibodies can, then go attach things and mess up viruses, and and antigen will viruses are instances of antigens and bacteria. And and and tag them for pickup by macrophages or other types of phagocytes. Those were the B cells. Then you have your T cells. And here, I'm going to talk.  About T-cells a little bit differently than I had in the last few videos, just to give a little bit more of a Nuance. So there's two types of T cells. And you might be able to say, hey there, helper T cells, and cytotoxic T cells and you're not wrong. But what I'm going to do is do a slightly different differentiation, just so that you, you are familiar with these terms. So there's two types of T cells.  Just like that. All T cells have T cell receptors. Let me draw the T cell receptors.  T cell receptors, just like that.  But they also have these other proteins on them.  And some of them have these proteins called, I'll just call it. I'll draw it like that called CD4 proteins. And some of them have, I'll do it in a different color and some of them have what's called cd8.  CD CD 8. So this one right here would be called a cd8 positive T Cell. It has the cd8 proteins on it. And this would be called a CD4 positive CD4 positive T Cell. I've never used these words before. You're like gee, where's this coming from? Now? The CD4 receptor is the thing that wants to bind. This is the thing that helps to go to the MHC.  Two complexes. So most CD4 T-cells are helper T cells. So this is you know, most of the time and I want to make it very clear Immunology is a very, I mean, this field people are discovering things on a regular basis. So people are still understanding these things and there's all sorts of special cases, but usually, when people talking about talk about CD4 positive T cells, they're talking about helper T cells. So this is normally going to be a helper.  A helper T cell or you could call it t helper. Just like that likewise the cd8 proteins. These are attracted to the MHC, one complex.  These are attracted to mhc1, you can kind of say this is what brings them to the to the the cells that have the cancer that are that I have expressed antigens on their MHC one complex. So most of the time cd8, positive T cells are cytotoxic Sido toxic. So cytotoxic T cell and oftentimes before cell gets activated. They just described it as a CD4 T cell or cd8 T-cell. And then, after it becomes 4,  A to the side of toxic T-cell after it becomes activated and starts wanting to kill things, then maybe you call it cytotoxic, but this is all, you know, this is all wordplay. I think you get the general idea. But just to remember what they do. This guy. We just said it, he'll Bond. He wants to bond to the MHC complex. So you have MHC complex plus presenting, some antigen plus presenting some antigen. This is mhc1 right here. We learned in the last video.  Yo, every nucleated cell in the body. Expresses an MHC one complex. So this is a case where something wacky is happening inside. This cell may be a virus, has infected it. Maybe it's cancerous. It's just it's it, it needs to die. Otherwise, it's going to keep producing protein keep producing viruses. If it's infected by a virus or otherwise, it's going to keep dividing if it's a Cancer and in fact the rest of the body. So the cd8 kills infected cells kills.  I'll just say bad cells because I don't know if you can cancer. Really isn't infection. Kills bad cells cells that are you know, if you don't kill him, the going to keep producing viruses or keep splitting and spreading the cancer, while T cells, they're attracted to professional antigen presenting cells. So and I was doing gendered Excel right here because they're also the best antigen presenting cells and they have cd.  SRM H2, complexes and it's digested, some antigen and it presents it right there. And then that activates that activates the helper T cell. And then when the helper T cell, when the helper T cell, all of these guys, once they're activated, they all go into effector effect. They all start differentiating into effector and memory cells, an effector helper, T cell does a couple of things it can. So if we're talking about helper T cell it can  Of ate, it can activate.  B cells and it also releases, cytokines it out. Let's say this guy gets activated. He'll also start releasing these chemicals which are really those alarm bells that tell other people to really get in gear. Maybe, you know, B cells and cytotoxic T cells. Start, proliferating more rigorously. Actually, part of the T-cell act, the that cytotoxic T Cell Activation can be assisted or kind of given a be given a boost by these cited by these cytokines. So  These alarm Bells. So this guy is the alarm ringer alarm alarm, while the cd8 cells or the cytotoxic T cells, went in there, effector mode. They kill cells, they kill cells. And of course in the memory mode. There's just a bunch of copies of these Originals around that are ready and more than they were originally were so that in the future, if something like this, or something like this occurs, they're going to be activated faster because we're going to be bumped into faster. So hopefully that clears up a little  Bit. And I introduced a little bit more top terminology, but I really want to stress. My wife's point because she said, hey, you don't want people out there saying B cells produce antibodies, even though it is effector B cells, once activated, B cells, that have differentiate into effector B cells. Those are, what are producing antibodies because when they go to medical school, people are going to hear plasma cell.\",\n",

I want to emphasize that my perspective is coming from one with type 2 and not type 1 diabetes. Our channel is primarily for those with type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes today. I want to answer the question.  Is pre-diabetes the same thing as impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose after you watch the video today? I invite you to check out the description box for my new ebook. This is one of the most comprehensive diabetes meal planning books. You can find anywhere it contains diabetes friendly meals and recipes recipes for different goals such as eight hundred two 1800 calories per day meal plans diabetes me.  Planning tips and tricks. There are also tons of diabetes friendly recipes for everyone for all intents and purposes. Yes prediabetes is the same as I GT or ifg. They all mean the same thing that one point it was which test was used as to what the condition was called. See what you call something is kind of interesting, isn't it? Do you know it is now Politically Incorrect to call.  One with diabetes a diabetic now diabetic medications and diabetic foods are fun. But many people who have diabetes actively resist being labeled as a diabetic.  As if it were an illness. Well a correspondent writes what I give as example to doctors and other technical people is if a person has hemorrhoids, does that make that person one now? I personally am not offended one bit by the term diabetic if someone refers to me is that it honestly doesn't bother me one bit, but I know others are very sensitive to that term, they see it as derogatory, but I have tried to be very careful in my  Video series to not use that term when describing people because it does offend some people with diabetes and that just isn't something I want to do but terms in the world of diabetes have been developing and changing over the years what used to be called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus IDDM is now referred to as type 1 diabetes. The former terms adult onset diabetes or non insulin-dependent.  Dependent diabetes mellitus are now called type 2 diabetes and there's really no such thing as borderline diabetes if that's what you think you have you either have pre-diabetes or you have diabetes. So what was once called impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose is now pre diabetes or prediabetes. You see there's even some controversy today over where there should be a hyphen in there between the pre and die.  PT's the reason given for this change was to show the seriousness of the condition. Now the latest I have found to be quote unquote argued in the diabetes Community is to change the name of prediabetes to Stage 1 type 2 diabetes as many of you know, many doctors and even insurance companies don't recognize pre-diabetes as diabetes proper the movement to change the name to Stage 1 type 2 is starting to gain ground.  And this is one movement. I think I can support it gives those with pre-diabetes a more concrete idea of what they truly have, but I can see the flip side. It also gives a sense that just because they have prediabetes. It will definitely become type 2 and that simply isn't true names can change a total outlook on things but rather than argue over the name of what you have. It is much more important to work on your diet.  And your exercise plan to control that blood sugar or blood glucose? Yes. There are people who want to argue that as well. Is it BG or DS? Probably a little bit of both. Don't forget to get my new e-book and please subscribe to our channel for many more videos like this one in the future. I want to thank you so much for watching.

I want to emphasize that my perspective is coming from one with type 2 and not type 1 diabetes. Our channel is primarily for those with type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes today.

Such as eight hundred, two 1800 calories per day meal plans, diabetes meal, planning tips and tricks. There are also tons of diabetes friendly recipes for  One. Now. This is a very difficult question to answer because support groups and therapy are a very individual experience. Some people thrive and support groups. While others really see no real progress in the process. Now, there are all kinds of support groups and I am sure if you look at churches hospitals, community, outreach centers, you can find a support group for just about anything. Now, one of the people I trust, in my research is carried.  Carol Bennett Carol is a professional counselor. But also an accomplished author. She has a real down-to-earth approach to counseling so much of what I'm about to say. I learned from her In Articles and books concerning support groups. You see people seek out support groups to share, their personal experiences. In dealing with situations that have altered their life in some way. Prediabetes, certainly would fall into that category. There Is An Invisible Thread.  Read that forms a bond of understanding and empathy towards each other. As they share discomfort, resentment fear, triumphs emotional and physical relapse has now. I think for support groups to really serve a purpose, there should be some discomfort, a process of looking at oneself and an honest, light and determining, if they're just going over the same territory, or in actuality taking away new tools and new perceptions for those who have pre-diabetes.  Tease, this is especially important. You need to look. Honestly at your lifestyle, decide, you need to make a change or to support group setting will probably not help. Now in a support group setting, you can hear successes and failures. This can either motivate you or give you an excuse to just fail and accept Diabetes Type 2 is in is inevitable. Carol has a couple of theories on support groups and I want to share those with you. These are her words, exactly.  But I could never say what she needs to what needs to be said better than her. So thanks, Carol. Support groups can become just a repetitive habit someplace to go at a certain time and a certain day. They met blanket, your ability to take action and change things on your own. You can't pat yourself on the back for just suiting up and showing up if you don't implement the concepts and ideas shared support groups are  Pressing because of their subject matter going over the same things over and over again might prove to be a downer for many and a constant reminder of where they may be falling short in their lives. Also support groups that don't encourage comments, or thoughts at the moment. When one is sharing. Well, they fall short of the mark feedback and interaction can stimulate opinions, options, ideas, and new thinking. Now I would like to push a support group.  Envelope and introduce the living life on terms group and its offshoots. Now. This is Carol's little attempt at humor. But I think it's really, really good. In showing you how the support group system can fail, she calls the group, The IGS support group, instant gratification syndrome. Consisting of people who have zero patience for anything. They have difficulty planting and visible seeds and their visionary.  Gardens. And they want to pull the Sprouts up demanding. They grow faster. Then, there's the Henny Penny, the sky is falling group. This group, consists of the knee-jerk, reaction of the Doomsday plot. Woe, is me my life is over, because this or that happened, there's a rapid downward. Spiral feeding off. The negativity turned up by emotions. The what if or choked with fear group, not being able to take a deep breath and realize that the  Here is probably imagined your thinking can be off and running and you have no more success in quelling than you would have in herding cats.  The fire-breathing dragon group. Now, this group has a following of folks that are in a constant state of agitated, anger, resentment, and frustration. Then there's the Ants in My Pants. Kurt. These are people sharing that they can't sit still and need constant activity and motion to fill their day. And believe this is the only way to be productive. Now, of course, all these groups are pretty silly, but the bottom line is that we all need a support group.  In some kind of shape, or fashion talking laughing crying with others, about the smallest issues, to Monumental ones might help, and they might help, keep everything in perspective and keep us grounded. You see, sometimes we appreciate how ridiculous or out of proportion. Are thinking is and reflecting on it with others is a good way to see that. So I Echo Carol thoughts and I do believe in support groups, but as I stated earlier that choice,  Is very individual and you need to make that decision for yourself. We also have things like online support groups. I've done a video on that, so you may want to check that one out as well.

       " 'Xe7PKGINr9Q': \"Starting with acetyl Co a acetyl CO a, is, an important molecule in biological reactions and it plays an important part in the synthesis of cholesterol. Acetyl-coa, is basically an acetyl group that is linked to coenzyme. A let me just shortened coenzyme, a to just Co a so in that first step on our list below, you can see that if we combine two acetyl, coas together through the enzyme file Ace.  We get a molecule called osito osito Co a if we then take that molecule and add another acetyl Co a through the enzyme. Hm G, Co a synthase, we have hmg-coa and this is where the statins work. The statins, block The Next Step. What's supposed to happen is that this hmg-coa is supposed to be reduced to mevalonic acid. Again, the statins block this from happening and therefore, ultimately inhibitory.  Decrease the production of cholesterol de novo in the liver.  Major side effects for the statins include hepatotoxicity. However, while this can be severe only about one to two people per 10,000, patient years have this problem. What's more common by far is myositis or myalgias? It is very common that your patients could complain of muscle aches while on this medication and in severe cases, they could have Rhabdomyolysis from it as four examples for the statins. We  These four here, rosuvastatin atorvastatin simvastatin and Lovastatin. And I organized this list in this way, on purpose, on the right side of this little list are the equivalencies rosuvastatin is the strongest of these for statins with an equivalency of 1.0 Lovastatin is the weakest of the statins with an equivalency of eight. In other words, you would need theoretically, and it doesn't work out exactly. But you would need about eight milligrams of lowest at  In two equally effect that you get with one milligram of rosuvastatin. And finally, if you really want to impress, your preceptor is look up the asteroid trial which was done in 2006. It showed that patients who are treated with 40 milligrams of rosuvastatin. Actually had a regression of their atherosclerosis plaques at a two-year follow-up.  Moving on. Now, the fibrates these drugs are pretty easy to pick out in a group because they end in fibrate or FIB. Raziel. These drugs are often given in combination with the statins because there's not a lot of good evidence to support using them alone. As for their mechanism of action, they act by stimulating, or activating the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor, subtype alpha or Bri veted people.  Alpha, don't confuse this with P part gamma the P part gamma is stimulated by the related class of drugs, the thiazolidinediones which are used for diabetes. So naturally in the body, these peep. Our Alpha receptors are found on the cell nucleus. They are used in the regulation of carbohydrates and fatty acids, when we stimulate these receptors with the fibrates. We change that metabolism and this works.  By having the drug binds the receptor, which makes the receptors move into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, the people are alpha binds. Another receptor called, The retinoid X receptor and that complex binds DNA on sequences that are called peroxisome proliferator hormone response elements. These response elements are responsible for the expression of proteins that are involved in the metabolism of fatty acids and Triassic glycerides. So for example, you would see an increase  Seen the expression of lipoprotein lipase. This would increase the metabolism of Triassic glycerides. Also, it would increase the expression of April lipoprotein, a one and a polite. Bow protein, a to those are lipo proteins that are important in the structure of an HDL particle. The side effects for the FIB rates include GIF set. This is really common. You very well could see your patient complained of a stomach ache on the FIB rates.  Also, as previously mentioned, the fibrates increase a person's risk for myositis or myalgias, especially when taken with the statins and last for the side effects of the fibrates because we change the metabolism of lipids, we increase the excretion of cholesterol in the bile. Thus, increasing the risk for cholesterol gallstones. Okay, and finally, three examples of fibrates are beza fibrate, Jim fibrin.  And finna fibrate. All right.  Next in our adventures through the anti hyperlipidemia X is niacin. Niacin is also called vitamin B3, nicotinic acid and it has the brand names of nice, man, and Nike or, yes. This is the niacin of which a deficiency causes the disease. Pellagra, which don't forget is known by the 3D's diarrhea dermatitis and dementia covered in a,  Lecture the mechanism of action for the anti hyperlipidemia.  The cool things about niacin or or one of the neat things that nice and can do is it really does a great job of increasing a patient's HDL and this it does by increasing the expression or production of a pole lipoprotein. A one, which we previously mentioned in the previous slide for the FIB rates, is one of the important components to an HDL particle and also it decreases the hepatic HDL uptake so it lets HDL circulate longer.  Niacin is famous for causing cutaneous flushing and pure itís. I haven't met anyone yet. Who has taken this medicine at a therapeutic dose and hasn't felt a little bit flushed or at least a little bit. Itchy. This isn't dangerous. It's just annoying. And it can be decreased by preemptively taking an in said before you take niacin.  Niacin can also cause hepatotoxicity and this is one of the more serious side effects of niacin, but not necessarily very common. Lastly, for the side effects niacin inhibits, the tubular secretion of uric acid that increases the circulating concentration. And thus increases the risk of gout in someone who may otherwise be predisposed to that condition. Niacin is high-yield. Remember niacin.  Bile acid sequestrants also called, bile acid. Resins are a pretty important group. I'm not going to give them a 5 out of 5. I'm going to give them a 4 out of 5. On the important scale. We use them to treat patients with hyperlipidemia and they work by interrupting the intrahepatic circulation of bile. So real quick, what is that enterohepatic circulation deals with or refers to the circulation or the cycle?  Oil of bile being produced by the liver excreted through the biliary system. Moving through the GI tract where they participate in the absorption of other fatty acids, triglycerides and cholesterols and then being resorbed themselves. Broken down returned to the liver and then reproduced. And then the cycle repeats itself about 90 to 95 percent of bile salts, that the liver produced are resorbed or returned or cycle through the  So if we interrupt this pathway, the liver has to continually produce more bile. So if we can somehow interrupt this circulation so that the bile is no longer resorbed. But instead is passed in the stool. Then the liver is forced to regenerate bile, which is produced from cholesterol. So, how do bile acid sequestrants do this? Well, they act as ion exchange resins, which exchange and  I want like chloride for example for bile salts there by binding or sequestering. The bile acids are bile salts. From the intrahepatic circulation. Forcing the bile salts to be excreted in the feces instead of being reused the side effects for the bile acid sequestrants are pretty few. Honestly. And the reason for this is that these drugs are not absorbed systemically. They are meant to be taken and passed through the GI system, taking bile salts.  With them, most often. What I've seen is that patients will complain of a bad taste. Sometimes patients will complain of constipation diarrhea, bloating flatulence. But usually they're well tolerated, a few examples of bile acid, sequestrants include cholestyramine cholesterol, and lastly, coalesce Evelyn.  Now, for the cholesterol absorption Inhibitors, really. There's only one of these one of them, that's commonly used. Anyway, and that's a Zetas. Me babe. Also known as Zetia. The mechanism of action for Zetia is related to, but not quite the same as the bile acid sequestrants. So, I'm going to use the same picture to talk about it. Remember the bile acid sequestrants block the resorption of bile. Thus the liver has to create  Eight nubile from circulating cholesterol, fatty acids and triglycerides. The cholesterol absorption Inhibitors kind of work. The same, they block the absorption of cholesterol from the brush border in the small intestine. This decreases the amount of cholesterol that's available to the liver. So the liver has to seek it elsewhere. It has to pull it from the circulation.  Side effects for Zetia could include myalgias. Like we've seen in some of the other families of drugs, a headache and Trans Am and itís which means an elevation and liver enzymes which in turn is basically just telling us that the liver is irritated.  Okay.  This last slide is just to help you.\",\n",

       " 'XFxMOiJRZQg': \"Pancreatic carcinoma describes the pancreas having cancerous cells arise. Now a healthy pancreas has two types of glands exocrine glands, which send digestive enzymes off to the small intestine and endocrine glands, which help regulate metabolism in the body. For example, maintaining normal blood sugar over 95% of pancreatic tumors develop in the pancreas is exocrine tissues and  of these tumors arising in the epithelial cells lining. The pancreatic ducts account for the vast majority of cases.  This type of pancreatic cancer is known as pancreatic adenocarcinoma, due to the cells glandular like appearance under the microscope often pancreatic adenocarcinomas used interchangeably with pancreatic carcinoma. These tumors typically form in the head or the neck of the pancreas, but in some cases tumors form the tail  Around five percent of exocrine pancreatic carcinomas are caused by malignancies in the acinar cells, which are the cells that produce digestive enzymes, like trypsinogen and around. 1% are assist adenocarcinomas or malignant cysts. There are also other types of pancreatic cancer. But those are even more rare. Generally. Pancreatic carcinoma is caused by genetic mutations in the ductile epithelial cells, and these mutations might activate oncogenes, which promote cancer or inactivate,  Tumor suppressor genes. Either way this can lead to uncontrolled cell growth caused by the disruption of the cell signaling Pathways that regulate cell survival and growth as well as multiple immune system responses, like, inflammation and stress responses. Although it's not exactly clear how these genetic mutations. That trigger pancreatic, carcinoma develop. There are some well-known modifiable risk factors like smoking, which increases the risk by 225 fold.  Obesity, as well as eating a diet high in red meat.  There also some non-modifiable risk factors like being male being African-American and being over 65 years old.  Also, certain other diseases seem to increase the risk of developing pancreatic carcinoma.  Like diabetes, chronic pancreatitis and liver cirrhosis, all of which are linked to excessive alcohol consumption. So there does seem to be an indirect relationship between pancreatic carcinoma and alcohol as well.  Finally, a family history of pancreatic cancer is also an important risk factor with inherited mutations, like, brca2 or breast cancer Gene to being the most common cause of inherited pancreatic carcinoma with mutations in PA lb to taking second place.  Initially symptoms are often vague, like nausea, vomiting and fatigue. There might also be weight loss, which might be due to cancer Associated, anorexia or malabsorption due to an obstructed pancreatic duct, which can cause Seattle area or foul-smelling greasy, loose stools.  One of the most specific symptoms of pancreatic. Carcinoma is mid epigastric pain that radiates to the mid or lower back, which often Hurts the Most at night when the individuals lying down flat.  Another classic symptom that's been described as called the trousseau, sign of malignancy, which is when blood clots, that can be felt as small lumps Under the Skin appear unexpectedly in superficial veins and then over time migrate to different locations as well as core voyagers sign, which is when the gallbladder is enlarged. Impalpable and the patient, doesn't find it at all. Tender to the touch which is unlike gallstones.  The location of the tumor can affect the symptoms as well. For example, the tumors in the head of the pancreas, then it can block the common bile duct which leads to a backup of bile and causes obstructive jaundice individuals. With this might have a loss of appetite darker urine and lighter stools as well as eventually developing pruritus or itchy skin and having their skin turn yellow.  If instead the tumor affects the endocrine function of the pancreas, then a new onset of diabetes in an older patient might also be a sign of pancreatic carcinoma.  Laboratory findings are generally nonspecific for pancreatic carcinoma. Both serum amylase and serum lipase levels might be elevated as well as tumor markers, see a 19-9 antigen, which is a molecule that helps with immune surveillance and cea a glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion.  The activation of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes can disrupt their production. So that elevated levels appear in the bloodstream. Since these aren't specific for pancreatic carcinoma though. They might even be elevated in patients without cancer, particularly those who smoke. And so these can't be used for diagnosis.  Sometimes when there are related problems like obstructive jaundice, it might cause elevated bilirubin alkaline phosphatase and transaminase levels.  Medical Imaging techniques are used to confirm a diagnosis and help with staging. Stage one is tumors. Less than 2. Cm stage 2 is tumors greater than 2 centimeters stage 3. Is it can spread to neighboring, tissues and organs, like the duodenum in the stomach and stage 4 is metastatic. Meaning it can spread through the blood and lymph to other tissues, like the liver and the lungs.  Finally, Imaging can also be used to help, determine if it's resectable.  For treatment chemotherapy might be given as a neoadjuvant, meaning used to shrink the tumor before, surgery or as an adjuvant therapy after surgery, or to help individuals who can't have surgery at all.  Unfortunately, most people with pancreatic carcinoma have a poor prognosis because it's typically pretty Advanced at the time of diagnosis. Even among patients with Stage 1, pancreatic carcinoma. The long-term. Survival rates are pretty low.  All right, as a quick recap pancreatic carcinoma is most commonly a cancer of the exocrine pancreas, especially in the ductal epithelial cells of the head and neck of the pancreas.  And it's often caused by mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes which leads to unchecked cell growth.  Thanks for watching.

       " 'XfyGv-xwjlI': 'Diabetes refers to a group of conditions characterized by a high level of blood glucose commonly referred to as blood sugar too much sugar in the blood can cause serious sometimes life-threatening health problems.  There are two types of chronic diabetic conditions type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.  Pregnant women May acquire a transient form of the disease called gestational diabetes, which usually resolves after the birth of the baby pre-diabetes is when the blood sugar level is at the borderline higher than normal but lower than in diabetics.  Prediabetes may or may not progress to diabetes.  During food digestion carbohydrates or carbs break down into glucose, which is carried by the bloodstream to various organs of the body.  Insulin is a hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas and is necessary for glucose intake by target cells.  In healthy people beta cells of the pancreas produce insulin.  Insulin binds to its receptors on target cells and induced glucose intake.  In type 1 diabetes beta cells of the pancreas are destroyed by the immune system by mistake.  The reason why this happens is unclear but genetic factors are believed to play a major rule.  Insulin production is reduced less insulin binds to its receptor on target cells less glucose is taken into the cells more glucose stays in the blood type one is characterized by early onset symptoms commonly start suddenly and before the age of 20.  Type 1 diabetes is normally managed with insulin injection type 1 diabetics are there for insulin dependents?  In type 2 diabetes the pancreas produces enough insulin, but something goes wrong either with receptor binding or insulin signaling inside the target cells.  The cells are not responsive to insulin and therefore cannot import glucose glucose stays in the blood. In other words type 2 diabetics are insulin resistant.  Here again genetic factors predispose susceptibility to the disease, but it is believed that lifestyle plays a very important role in type 2 typically obesity an active lifestyle and unhealthy diet are associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes.  Type 2 is characterized by adult onset symptoms usually appear gradually and start after the age of 30 type 2 diabetes accounts for about 80 to 90% of all diabetics management focuses on weight loss and includes a low-carb diet.',\n",
       " 'JBqbv8GRZ4': \"The great debates bodyweight exercises or free weights, which one is better. Now, there are other people in both camps that adamantly believe that their method is very clearly the better option of the two some go as far as saying that doing the other is absolutely pointless. Now, we know of course that that's just not true. There are many examples of individuals in both camps that have gotten great results in aspects of Fitness such as improving strength and muscle growth. The thing is anyone that tells you to avoid doing  One or the other for whatever reason does not know the full benefits of the alternative truthfully. Yes one can be better in some ways than the other body weight exercises AKA calisthenics are better suited to improve functional movements that are used in daily life after all the whole basis of calisthenics is to move your body through space without any restrictions free weights on the other hand are mainly static loads where you stay in a single place and manipulate the weight from point A to point B, for example, if you want to improve your  Capabilities and moving more fluidly through a rocky environment such as on a hike stair runs and box jumps would be better suited than improving your squat. However free weights have an advantage when it comes to simplifying progression. If you wanted to build strength, you simply have to lift heavier weights. This goes the same for building muscle by increasing volume through increasing reps sets or load. If you watch my video about calisthenics, I stated with much backlash that bodyweight exercises are simply not as easy to improve strength.  And muscle growth and that remains true calisthenics progression is much more technically complex than your standard add on more weights progression. Take the push up. For example, where the most common progressions are raising your feet off the floor dips or single arm push-ups for free weights. You can similarly progress in a dumbbell bench, press simply by lifting heavier dumbbells for your average Joe that simply wants to get a stronger chest free weights clearly require less learning efforts. There are also other advantages in both camps.  Bodyweight exercises for the most part is absolutely free free weight exercises require you to either purchase weight equipment or a gym membership for calisthenics. You can always go to a local park that have Cal extending bars to exercise at the very most you can purchase things like a pull-up bar or a suspension training system. If you want to work out from home a winning advantage of free weights is being able to Target specific muscle groups because calisthenics consists of many natural and functional movements, which is usually a good  Good thing it requires that multiple muscle groups are targeted at the same time. However, there are cases where you do want to isolate a specific muscle in a workout and a great way in doing so is by using weights whether it's because you want a particular muscle to be stronger or larger or because you're recovering from an injury isolation movements are achieved best with weights. Speaking of injuries many calisthenics enthusiasts will tell you to avoid free weight exercises because it's easier to get hurt now on paper in might make  And since free weights require you to lift heavy loads and put a lot of stress on your muscle tendons joints and ligaments, but the fact of the matter is with a proper training program and learning proper form. They will hardly ever be a time where you'll Place yourself in danger of getting hurt. The only time it would be if you're trying to lift the weight that is clearly out of your capabilities or that you're performing an exercise with improper form. And that goes the same with bodyweight Fitness tried to do a movement that you're physically not capable of doing or do a movement the  Wrong way you can just as much hurt yourself as well. So with all this being said which one is actually better. Well as boring as this may sound it all boils down to it depends if your goal is to pack on muscle fast without much learning effort free weights are for you if you want to improve your capabilities of moving your body through space rather than pushing big things around then calisthenics are the way to go. It also depends on what you enjoy doing more some people simply like him.  In big heavyweights round and some people enjoy working out in the fresh air free of Weights limiting their body movements. And the thing is even though each had advantages. It doesn't mean that the other can't be good at it too. Even though free weight exercises seem to be the better option for building strength and muscle there is no doubt that calisthenics can be pretty much Limitless in these aspects as well. As long as you're willing to dedicate some work to it. And that's the catch for most most people just want to be healthier.  ER or look slightly better than they do now. Yes doing something like push-ups and pull-ups can be beneficial to the average person but things such as flag poles or front levers mean very little to them but if that's what you want to be able to do then by all means do it and that goes the same for a freeway training many of your standard calisthenic movements can be done with weight added to it which technically transformed into a free weight exercise. But of course we're talking about the typical exercise is done in Egyptian leg presses and back rows are great for  Pretty much anyone but the majority of people don't care to deadlift 500 pounds off the floor. But again, if you're into something like power lifting then it's completely reasonable to start stacking plates on the bar. Ultimately. The best thing that you can do for yourself is do both as we can see they both have great advantages that anyone can benefit from so why limit yourself to just one do both and reap the benefits of both or do one it's up to you.

       " 'Nf--q0YMq8': \"All right, and then on that note, why don't we move on to the next part of the pancreas, which is known as the endocrine pancreas? And this is actually the part of the pancreas. That is the most famous. We hear the most about this as we'll see in a minute because it has a lot to do with diabetes. The endocrine pancreas will release hormones rather than the salts are enzymes. We saw above will release hormones that  Go into the bloodstream and they will move on elsewhere throughout the body to the liver. Perhaps the intestine or even as far as muscles to cause things to happen. And the way the endocrine pancreas is organized is that there are many eyes lit cells. It's actually pronounced eyelet, but I'm mispronouncing. It just to let you know how it's spelled eyes lit or islet, cells that exist and sit.  In Islands, sit in Islands. So there are three types or three main types of islet cells we're going to talk about and they're all present to some extent in each island or group of cells in the pancreas and let's go through them one by one. So first of all, we've got what are called alpha islet cells, alpha islet cells and these guys release a hormone that's called glucagon.  Gone, and the main function of glucagon is to take things like glycogen, which is a whole bunch of glucose molecules that are stacked up on top of each other, and then break them down into smaller, glucose monomers or molecules. So, we're making glucose from glycogen whenever we release our glucagon, so I'll write glucagon up here and it's not just  Carbohydrates, but glucagon is responsible for the breakdown of a whole bunch of macromolecule. So I'll just drive it home by writing. Glucagon causes breakdown over here. The next type of islet cell that we have. And perhaps the most famous of them all are our beta islet cells. So our beta islet cells house and release insulin. Now, when you hear insulin, there should be a lot of light bulbs coming up because insulin is  For a whole bunch of things for one, when we look over here, insulin is what causes the opposite of this reaction. Where instead of breaking down glycogen into glucose insulin causes glucose to be stored or built up into glycogen. So insulin does the exact opposite and again to drive that home? It's not just for carbohydrates, but it's a whole bunch of things that get built up. So, I'll write insulin is responsible for the build-up or storage.  Each of our macromolecules, but what might be the most important thing to mention about insulin is that it is the hormone that is related to or responsible for the disease known as diabetes. And gosh, we can have entire tutorials on diabetes and what it does and what it means. But for right now, just know it. It's Bare Basics diabetes, occurs or causes damage to our bodies because we have too much glucose too much.  Floating around in our body, too much sugar. All right, and that happens because insulin is not working properly. We're not building up and storing glucose into glycogen. Like we're supposed to be doing instead. It's running all over the body and because of that, we have what's called I nerve  And kidney disease, that's sort of the catch phrase. We use in medicine, describe diabetes, its eye nerve and kidney disease because with too much glucose over time, were unable to see the nerves most commonly in our feet, are not able to sense, Prix, or things or damage that occurs there and eventually they could cause amputation and our kidneys stopped working overtime, which could lead to dialysis and that causes early death. And in addition to these three glucose.  Goes all over the body and causes a whole bunch of other things like earlier, onset, heart attack, and other types of complications. The other thing I should mention about diabetes is that there are two types of diabetes. There are two types. There is type 1, diabetes. And there is Type 2 and the way you differentiate type 1 versus type 2. Diabetes is based on how it's caused and this all points back to in.  One. In type 1 diabetes. We have no insulin. So the person that has Type 1, diabetes has no insulin production and because of that we're not able to store our sugar in glycogen. We're not able to put it away. And so we have it all over the place that causes eye nerve and kidney disease among other complications in type 2, diabetes, your insulin receptors. So you have insulin that's being produced, but your insulin  Orders are broken. Your insulin receptors are broken. So even if we do produce insulin and it goes to where it's supposed to go in our body, these receptors will not respond. And so it's as if we don't have insulin in our body at all, and there's so much more that we can say here, but we'll close our conversation on Diabetes for now. And we'll revisit this later. Let's move on to the third type of islet cell that we've got in the pancreas. And those are Delta islet cells.  A islet cells and these are the guys that release a hormone called somet. Oh, so Matt. Oh Staten, so Matos Staten, which is the major party pooping hormone released from the endocrine pancreas because its main job is to stop the jobs of all the other hormones that are active. And these hormones can include things like what we've talked about here, glucagon. Insulin.  And but there are other hormones that are also in playing the GI tract that include things like cholecystokinin that we talk about elsewhere and somatostatin will go in and cause the effects of those hormones to stop and that's sort of its main role there. So that's our endocrine pancreas and as we talked about earlier are exocrine pancreas, so the pancreas is responsible for a lot. No wonder surgeons have the phrase eat when you can sleep when you can and don't mess with the pancreas.\",\n",

The first thing that you want to remember is to monitor the amount of carbohydrates you eat that way, you're able to control your blood, glucose levels, or blood sugar levels. So what is a carbohydrate? Well car? Hydrates are found in bread and rice and pasta and other starchy things like potatoes and corn and legumes which are beans and peas. Carbohydrates are also found in Sweet foods and drinks like fruit and milk and yogurt as well as sugar-sweetened beverages fruit juice and some candy. And of course any sweet desserts.

Now, this diet has huge amounts of research that have shown wonderful benefits in improving cardiovascular health. And also, increasing insulin sensitivity, which is necessary for someone with type 2 diabetes. A mediterranean-style diet is rich in seasonal fruits, and vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats, like fish and nuts and avocados. And then it's going to be moderate amounts of cheese and dairy products.  Like milk and yogurt, it's going to be moderate amounts, of lean protein, and eggs, and then just minimal amounts of red meat and sweets. So, if you notice over here, there's still are carbohydrates in the Mediterranean style diet. In this is where carb counting comes into play. So I find that carb. Counting is the best way to monitor the amount of carbohydrates, you eat and drink at mealtime and for snacks. So, what I have done here is, I've portion  Doubt the carbohydrate containing foods into one carb serving. So, what does that mean? Well, 15 grams of carbohydrates, equals one carb serving. So let's take this piece of bread. For instance, this piece of bread contains about 15 grams of carbohydrates. So we'll say this is one carb serving. Now, if your recommended to consume to carb servings for breakfast, then you want to limit your carbohydrate intake to 30 grams that breakfast.  The American Diabetes Association recommends a good starting point, as 325 carb servings per meal. That would be a sandwich made out of two slices of bread. You could put meat and cheese in it along with a bunch of non-starchy vegetables and then a small side of fruit. And there you go. You have three carb servings. So what I'm going to do today is I'm going to show you how to make the most out of this diet.  So I'm going to take a little over one cup of spinach, and then I'm going to grab some tomatoes and a radish.  And what's great about these vegetables, is they're very low in carbohydrates. So we call them free foods. You can pretty much eat as much as you want of these foods and not raise your blood glucose levels. So I'm going to add this to the salad and I always love adding a salad to any meal because it just helps helps fill you up. So we're going to slice up some of this radish and add it to the salad. And then we're going to grab some water.  That's what's your filled with really healthy fats.  They're really great for your brain health and to raise your good cholesterol, your HDL cholesterol. So I'm just going to crush some of that. Now, one serving size is about one Palm full which is one ounce of nuts. And then I'm going to add in some just mozzarella cheese. Just slice it up, sprinkle it on and then we're going to do salad dressing. So it's really just one tablespoon of olive oil and a half a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar.  Or whatever vinegar that you prefer, so I'm going to drizzle it over.  And now, of course you can buy salad dressing in the grocery store, but it's probably more expensive. And if you get the low-fat version, then it's going to be high in sugar. So I say go with homemade, it's usually better anyways, so I'm also going to add in about 3 ounces of salmon fillet. And so, there you go. So this meal actually does not have many carbohydrates. It does not even have a full one carb serving. So if you want to add carbon  Hydrates to this meal, you could add half of a sweet potato, which is about 15 grams of carbohydrates. You could add one cup of strawberries, which is one carb serving.  And then you could add half a cup of grapes. So not all fruits are created equal. There are some that are higher in carbohydrates than others. For instance, berries are going to have the lowest amount of carbohydrates. Whereas grapes are a bit higher and so our bananas. So one carb serving of banana is going to be half of a banana and then for an apple one, small apple is going to be one carb serving. So if you have a big apple, you're probably going to want to cut it in half.  Monitor your carbohydrate intake. So, remember when you're trying to make a lifestyle, change involving your diet, it's not that difficult. Look at all the wonderful food that you get to eat. All you have to do is make sure you're eating nutrient rich foods so high in vitamins and minerals so yummy fruits and vegetables, whole grains, things that are going to fill you up and keep you satisfied. They're also going to improve your health and just make you feel better. So, when you're adjusting your diet to control,  Your blood glucose levels or your blood sugar levels, go low in carbohydrates, and high in those healthy fats like olive oil, avocados in Salmon. It's going to take a little bit more preparation, but I know you can do it. So eat up and enjoy. Happy eating.\",\n",

       " 'XQtPFByWrWU': \"On the system of energy metabolism. And today, we are talking about key to Genesis. Ketogenesis is an important component of how we react to glucose deprivation in the last three lessons. We talked about gluconeogenesis in the context of. If we don't have enough glucose, we need to make it. But remember the main thing that we make glucose from is protein. And if we are in a state of glucose deprivation, we want that.  Take down our glucose requirement because if we just turn all the protein we have into all the glucose, we would normally use on a mixed diet. We're going to burn through a lot of protein really fast. And if you imagine that you're on a diet, that's mostly fat, which is often used as a ketogenic diet today or in the context of why these systems evolved to handle glucose deprivation in the first place, like fasting, your  We got to tap into your skeletal muscle and burn through it really fast. If you can't push down your glucose requirement. So while gluconeogenesis is how we make the glucose that we don't have ketogenesis is an important part of how we conserve the glucose that we do have or that we do get from protein. So we don't use it unnecessarily when we can get alternative fuels and the main thing that key the job.  Isis is doing is allowing tissues that aren't good at using fatty acids themselves to use Ketone bodies, which are water-soluble much smaller pieces of fatty acids made mostly by the liver.  And use those for energy in place of using glucose or using fatty acids themselves.  So clarifying the purpose as we just have, let's dig right into how the process of ketogenesis works as we first covered in Lesson, Four, in order for a seed oil, Co a to enter the citric acid cycle. It needs to condense with oxaloacetate to form. Citrate leaving coenzyme a freed in that reaction to pick up the next acetyl group. That means that in order for  Little Kuwait to enter the supply of oxaloacetate. Whether oxaloacetate is there is important.  The biochemical event that initiates ketogenesis is the accumulation of acetyl Co a when there is no oxaloacetate to drive it into the citric acid. Cycle to form citrate. This doesn't mean there's ever no oxaloacetate. That oxaloacetate is at zero Supply with this means is that if a seat Alcoa a is coming into the citric acid cycle?  Michael. And then oxaloacetate gets used up because there's only a certain amount available all the excess acetylcholine that's left over that can't enter the citric acid cycle will then undergo ketogenesis, but as we covered in Lesson 16 on an employer, osis normally pyruvate serves as a source of oxaloacetate whenever it's limiting. Remember the main fate of pyruvate is the  Undergo pyruvate dehydrogenase to form acetyl. Co a if the acetyl co a has oxaloacetate to enter the citric acid cycle, it does, if it doesn't it inhibits, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, temporarily and stimulates pyruvate carboxylase the inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase conserves pyruvate to enter through pyruvate carboxylase instead and acetyl Co a increasing the activity of this enzyme.  Which would otherwise be one of the few things in Biochemistry that ever is at zero activity in the absence of acetyl Co a binding to it that a acetyl CO a tamping up, pyruvate carboxylase allows pyruvate to form the oxaloacetate that's needed to allow acetyl Co a to enter again. Then that acetyl Co a stops accumulating parvat carboxylase goes back to zero and the main fate of pyruvate gets resumed to form acetyl Co a  This means that for ketogenesis to happen, you have to have depletion of oxaloacetate. That is not supplied. In this way, immediately thereafter. That means in order to get ketogenesis, you need depletion of pyruvate.  Although the main source of pyruvate on a mixed diet is carbohydrate because pyruvate is the end product of glycolysis and therefore is derived from glucose. We also talked in Lesson 16 on an apple or osis that the amino acid alanine can form pyruvate. And in fact, we also talked in lesson, 8 about how aspartate, another amino acid can directly form oxaloacetate, and how  Glutamate. Another amino acid can form Alpha ketoglutarate.  If alanine forms pyruvate, the pyruvate supplies oxaloacetate, that allows acetyl Co a to enter the citric acid cycle, and that prevents acetyl Co a from accumulating and entering into ketogenesis. If glutamate supplies Alpha, ketoglutarate that all think he'd a good rate becomes oxaloacetate, that does exactly the same thing again, preventing ketogenesis.  Not shown on this screen. There are many other amino acids that we will talk about when we get to protein metabolism. That can either form pyruvate or oxaloacetate or one of the precursors of oxaloacetate in a manner, analogous to what's shown on the screen for alanine aspartate and glutamate. The amino acids that we've already talked about in previous lessons.  What that means is that anything that makes oxaloacetate suppresses ketogenesis and therefore protein through a great variety of amino acids as well as glucose can. Equally suppress ketogenesis at a biochemical level.  Now, it's important to distinguish between the biochemical suppression of ketogenesis and the physiological suppression of ketogenesis Bio chemistry is the study of the reactions and the enzymes in the pathways that they come together to make physiology, is the study of how biochemistry and other processes within cells. And between cells are coordinated in a  Way to support the function of the organism, as a whole.  On a biochemical level carbohydrate and protein are equally suppressive of ketogenesis.  That's not true on the physiological level in order to understand the physiological suppression of ketogenesis by carbohydrate in insulin. We need to review lipoprotein lipase which we first introduced in lesson. 23, on insulin, secretion and hormone sensitive lipase, which we first introduced in lesson, 25 on how insulin shuts down fat burning. We then Revisited  Lipase again, in less than 26. On the question of whether insulin makes you fat. We're going to now come back to these same effects of insulin to look at how insolent suppresses ketogenesis on a physiological level to briefly review, lipoprotein, lipase and hormone sensitive lipase. They're shown on the screen, the left panel shows lipoprotein. Lipase lipoprotein, lipase is secreted by an LP, L producing cell LPL is  Burton like base. And that's L will send the LPL out to be embedded in the capillary endothelial cells of the capillaries that feed that tissue for the moment. Since we're mostly concerned with adipose fat. Let's think mostly about the adipocyte. So the adipocyte secretes LPL into the capillaries, that feed the adipose tissue and the LPL goes into the capillary endothelial bed.  Chylomicrons carry triglycerides from the fat in the meal that you had just eaten. And the triglycerides are hydrolyzed by LPL to glycerol and free fatty acids leaving behind chylomicron. Remnants that later get taken up mostly by the liver and the glycerol and fatty acids can into adipose tissue. There are other enzymes that will then resynthesize triglycerides from the glycerol and fatty acids me.  While the adipose tissue, as well as many other cells. But the adipose tissue for purposes of releasing fatty acids into the blood. Has hormone sensitive, lipase or hsl. And this is responsible for hydrolyzing triglycerides. Inside the adipocyte. They become glycerol. And fatty acids for release into the blood hsl and other tissues besides adipose tissue, serves the internal needs of that tissue, but in adipose tissue,  Ooh, we have LPL and hsl that determine the Flux Of free. Fatty acids, the more LPL activity. We have, the more fat will get taken up into adipose tissue. LPL activity can release fatty acids into the blood if they exceed the ability of the adipose tissue to take them up. But its main function is to get fat into the adipose tissue.  Each SL serves the opposite function. So we retain fat in adipose tissue when we have high LPL activity at adipose and low hsl activity at adipose. We have a lot of free fatty acids moving from adipose tissue into the blood. When we have the opposite conditions, insulin promotes the retention of fat in adipose tissue. Now we talked about  That doesn't mean that.\",\n",

Healing quickly can reduce your risk of developing serious complications key elements for successful healing are  Rest, eat a balanced diet and maintain your blood sugars in a controlled range where the device, your doctor tells you to wear at all times and refraining from smoking.  Foot ulcers need rest. In order to heal, if you were to break your leg. Your doctor would tell you not to walk on it. It is the same with your foot ulcer. We rest ulcers by taking off the load or offloading, the ulcer using special, casts, boots, or shoes.  The possible complications from a foot ulcer that fails to heal our development of an infection infection, spreading to the rest of the body resulting in hospitalization, amputation of the foot or leg, or even death.  Foot ulcers. Put you at considerable risk for amputation. Amputation of part of your foot or leg can lead to changes in your ability to do activities that are part of your everyday life. It can lead to a decrease in activity which can weaken your heart and body making it difficult to control your diabetes. It can also change the way you walk or move, potentially causing damage to your other foot and leg. Most importantly, the challenge of having an amputation can lead to depression and sadness affecting how you were able to.  Enjoy your family, friends and hobbies.  Normally your body's response to pain as a sharp reflex that allows you to recoil and prevent further injury. Diabetes causes changes to the nerves in your feet and the ability to feel or sense pain. It robs your body of the protective gift of pain or the ability to protect itself. This condition is called, neuropathy people with neuropathy, can walk with a stone and their shoe and not notice it. This could cause an ulcer a blister on their foot a person with neuropathy does not know that they have a sewer or a blister on their foot.  Because they cannot feel it. By the time, you notice the ulcer, it can become very serious. This is why it is important to check your feet. Every day for problems. Diabetes can cause the skin on your feet. To become very dry, creating cracks that later become Source or infected, ask your doctor to recommend a good moisturizer for your feet and heels.  People with diabetes, can also have changes in their leg and foot circulation. This reduces the oxygen nutrients and blood supply, to your leg, increasing your risk of getting an ulcer, and slowing your ability to heal your doctor. May order a test to examine your circulation because of these factors simple everyday activities, such as walking or standing on your injured foot can be harmful to your healing ulcer. It could worsen the condition or cause infection. If you smoke, it is important that you talk to your doctor about treatments to stop smoking.  Smoking is a large reason, why people develop circulation problems and their legs and feet. Continuing smoking will slow healing to your ulcer and likely make your circulation worse. The best way to heal your diabetic ulcer is to take off the load by using special casts, boots or shoes. It is important to wear these all the time. Even if you are only taking a few steps,  the best way to heal a diabetic foot ulcer is to use a special cast called a total contact cast research, shows that more people treated with total contact casts heal than with other treatments. These include bioengineered tissues such as growth factors or synthetic skin substitutes and negative pressure wound therapy. They also heal faster than with many other of the newer Advanced wound healing Technologies. People treated with total contact cast. He'll in an average of 42 days. So next, I'm going to make this  You removable, by adding on a layer of cohesive bandage. Your doctor can also adapt your diabetic walking boot so that you cannot take it off. This has been shown to be just as effective as a total contact cast. Your doctor may use a combination of wound and offloading treatments to best heal your ulcer. It may be scary to think of your ulcer being in a cast where you can't see it, but the cast helps even out your weight. So the pressure is not just on one part of your foot. Your doctor will change the cast every few days.  Days. And even up to once a week, if your ulcer is healing. Well, when a person breaks their leg, they don't tell the doctor that the cast is awkward or ugly and ask for another way to heal their leg. They know that wearing a cast and resting the bone as the best way to heal it. Likewise. It is important to take the pressure off your ulcer so that it can heal wearing your offloading device for every step will give you the best chance to heal your ulcer quickly.  Your foot ulcer heels at the rate of about 1 mm per day. Or about the width of a dime. Going Barefoot is another way to seriously risk further injury and complications in the comfort of their own homes patients. Either forget or choose not to where they're offloading device or protective Footwear for a few quick steps around the house or across the room. Don't do it. Every unprotected step is a day of healing lost. Going Barefoot will slow your healing and make your foot ulcer worse.  You may think that one step here or there, without the offloading device will not harm your ulcer. You may think that it is. All right, not to wear it for a couple of steps. When you get up to go to the bathroom, what you may not realize is that every step that you take without you're offloading device. As a day of healing lost. You need to wear your offloading device all the time. You don't want to go backwards and you want your ulcer to heal as fast as possible to avoid or help prevent complications.  Proper offloading using prescribed slippers or shoes with proper Orthopedic inserts. Greatly reduces High pressures on the bottom of your foot that can result in loss of healing. Real serration and complications such as infection.  Once you have had one ulcer, you are at a higher risk for another ulcer. So, once your ulcer has healed, you need to protect the new skin so that it becomes strong and you need to protect your foot from new ulcers. Once your ulcer is healed. You may think it is alright to start wearing regular shoes again, or even go barefoot. Unfortunately, even though your ulcer is healed. You should still never walk Barefoot. Even at home by wearing your diabetic foot where you protect your foot from high pressures and the danger of injury due to neuropathy.  Kathy injury can result in another ulcer and possible infection with all the complications that go with it. Your doctor May prescribe specially fitted shoes were orthotic inserts to continue to offload your foot and protect it. Remember diabetes can change the bones in your foot and create spots of high pressure. While you walk these high pressures continue to exist. Even after your ulcer is healed. Continued, proper offloading greatly reduces these pressures on your feet that can cause re-injury.  Ask your doctor about shoes or inserts that are specially fitted to your feet insurance will often cover the cost.  Improper choices of Footwear to events outside the home. Environment are a major cause of foot ulcers. Recurring fragile newly healed skin is not accustomed to equipped to handle the demands of a social event. It is very tempting to put on those dress shoes for just a few hours. Don't do it. Plan to use and where you're diabetic, Footwear for all of your activities, including social events. If you have a question about what you can or shouldn't wear, ask your doctor.  Remember important factors that help heal your ulcer. Are keeping your diabetes in good control, eating a balanced diet stopping smoking, rest wearing the device. The doctor tells you to wear at all times.  It is the goal of your doctor and Health Care team to help your ulcer heal as quickly as possible to minimize events such as infection amputation and possibly death to do this.

Thus the rate of sexual dysfunction in women will also increase, it was not until this study that the direct correlation could be substantiated. The effect of sexual dysfunction was correlated to neurological psychological and Vascular effects and combination of such.  However, despite the common knowledge that there is an association in their measurements of such is hard to create. It is difficult to measure sexual function in women. In many cases, the spouses sexual performance quality of sexual intercourse, patients, educational culture and socioeconomic status was also a large part of the problem. They also have a decreased sexual desire decreased stimulus.  Reduced lubrication and orgasm disorder. Thus diabetes, females are more at risk than others in this study. Several surveyors were sued to evaluate sexual function disorders. Sex is defined by the study as an ability to experience masculine or feminine emotions physical stimulation and / or mental feelings. It is also a perception that is expressed by the sexual organs of  Other the sexuality of a human being is determined by social norms values and taboos. This is also determined by psychological and social norms and aspects. The nature of the disease was also defined in the study. It had to be in order to evaluate the nature of sexual dysfunction with patients who are diabetic responses to sexual stimulation in the subjects was divided into four phases.  These included the arousal Plateau orgasm and resolution phase. These phases were identified as the most detrimental and prevalent issues that affected women during sexual satisfaction in the first phase. The libido is accessed. This is the appearance of erotic feelings and thoughts, real female, sexual desires, begins with the first phase. Also at this point, sexual thoughts, or feelings, or  Past experiences helped to create either a natural or unnatural arousal. Stage in patients, their second phase identified by Searchers. Here was the arousal phase in this phase. The parasympathetic nervous system is involved with that. The phase is then characterized by erotic feelings and the formation of a natural vaginal lubrication. The first sexual response begins with vaginal lubrication.  Which follows within 10 to 30 seconds and then follows from there. What follows is typically the rapid breathing session or rather? Tachycardia that causes women to have an increased blood pressure, and a general feeling of warmth, breast tenderness, coupled with erected nipples and coloration of the skin. Most women experience this arousal phase dot. The third phase is defined as the orgasm phase or rather the time with increased.  Allure and Vascular tension by sexual stimulation occurs. This is the most imperious of the cycles and is all be at the most satisfying for women during this period, women experience orgasmic responses from the sympathetic nervous. System changes also occur in the entire general region. These include a change in heart rate and blood pressure. The Final Phase of normal sexual stimulation is the resolution phase.  During this period, women have General changes basically the withdrawal of blood from the general region and the discharge of sexual tension. As occurs. After the orgasm will bring the entire body to a period of rest. The basis of sexual responses, cycle depends on normally functioning of the endocrine, vascular, neurological and psychological factors considering the brain is the center for sexual stimulation sexual.  Behaviors are directly correlated to the sense of being aroused. The study has defined sexual stimulation and peripheral stimulation Central stimulation is defined as the act of being aroused and sexual desire is phenomena. Mainly mediated by the meth Olympic dopaminergic. Pathway dopamine is the most important known gyro transmitter system responsible for the arousal. The process breaks down to the  Act, that testosterone is responsible for both female and male desire. And it increases blood flow, either directly and indirectly through estrogen. Sexual dysfunction has been classified and defined by the inability to experience anticipated sexual intercourse. This is a psycho social change that complicates interpersonal relationships and creates significant problems orgasm disorder, usually occurs with a recurrent delay or  LT in achieving an orgasm after sexual stimulation. Several sexual disorders have been affected by diabetes. Many others are blanketed under the sexual dysfunction term sexual. Aversion disorder is the avoidance of all General contact with ones Partners. The difference between the phobia and the feelings of disgust and hatred are part of the phobia. Sexual arousal disorder is the inability to establish adequate lubrication.  In a persistent manner. Orgasmic disorder is defined as a persistent or recurrent delay in or lack of normal phases. Orgasm is the sudden temporary Peak. Feeling, according to the data from the U .s National healthy and social life survey women who are at risk for SD in the study. It was found that women with healthy problems, have an increased risk for paint during intercourse. Also women with urinary.  Act problems or symptoms are at risk for problems during intercourse. The socioeconomic status of women is another risk factor as well as women who have been the victim of harassment. Menopause has a negative impact on sexual function in women. Sexual dysfunction, was not limited to affective disorders. In fact, socio cultural and social demographic causes affected demographic and sociological characters were  Gated in the studies conducted socio-demographic characteristics, like age, education level and income levels. Also, the use of an effective method of Family Planning was related to the BMI and marriage were also factors in this decisions. The use of alcohol and drugs was also linked to a woman's sexual response and leaves to SD the most prevalent, use came from antidepressants.  Saved for the treatment of depression were reported with the use of the prescription drugs, the effects included, a lack of lubrication, vaginal anesthesia and delay in or lack of orgasm. Other drugs that have were found to affect email SD included anti-hypertensive lipid-lowering agents and chemotherapeutic agents. The study also took into account that chronic diseases like systemic diabetes.  Hypertension causes psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, disorders and psychosis are attributed to chronic disease States. Diabetes is a common chronic disease with more than 90 percent of diabetics. Having been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Diabetic patients, have been found to have an elevated risk of vascular and neurological, complications, and psychological problem dot. Thus  It's because of this, it has been found that diabetics are prone to having female sexual dysfunction. Thus the subject of female diabetic SD with largely unrecognized until 1971.

It reduces the hydration of the mucous membranes of the vagina it in turn reduces. The lubrication levels, leading to painful sexual intercourse. The risk of vaginal infections increases because of that and so too does vaginal discomfort.  And painful intercourse. It is clinically hard to measure sexual function in women. In many cases, medical history, physical examination, pelvic examination and hormonal profile were reviewed. The subjects were question in. Detail, regarding spouses sexual performance, quality of the sexual intercourse, the patient's educational level and socioeconomic status.  The several questionnaires which were used to evaluate sexual function disorders, were a substantial methodology, sexual inventories were then classified into groups, the information obtained through a structured incentive, allowing the disclosure of terms.

       " 'XX1ps4WHAtg': \"So, I'm dr. Tire.  I am the Pediatric liaison for Sacramento and I am working with Deb to kind of enhance our pediatric training in the Ed. And so, every month, what we're going to be doing is these pediatric mock codes based on different topics and this month's topic is pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis. And so I'd like to start off with his little case scenario by the seven-year-old. Male that presents, the emergency departments is one day history of vomiting and just not  Feeling. Well current vitals are up there, normal temperature, a little bit. Tachycardic tachypneic, little bit hypotensive with the blood pressure of 90 over 65. When you look at him. He is lost our Jake but he's able to answer questions. He knows where he is. And then on further examination, you notice that he has kind of like a fruity odor to his breath. He has dry mucous membranes, but otherwise, his examination is relatively normal, we can get some past medical history.  No medical problems. Does take any medications. So let's try to get some lap, the labs that we draw. Our chem seven, we can get in vbg, not as dramatic. So that's ideal and a urine. And so these are the labs that we see in the notice that he has a sodium of 147. His potassium is 3.5 chloride, 112 and bicarb of five grand. In is normal. The UN is elevated at 28 and the glucose of 4:30 and an anion gap of 30. He  Is NI Gap metabolic acidosis? There are many things that can cause that in this case. It looks like it's dka. And so it also, you can see the urine is shows for plus glucose in addition to having ketones. So, there are four things that really Define dka when you have a pH is less than 7.3. If you have a bicarb that's less than 15 and you have a glucose that's greater than 300 and also the presence of ketones. So with those four things that identifies diabetic ketoacidosis,  Okay, so some pathophysiology. This is what happens.  You have insulin receptors on the cell, the insulin binds, the cell allows glucose to go in the insulin also penetrate the cell gets in there and block the pathway of lipogenesis. So it prevents the limit from getting metabolized without that insulin. What happens is you have all the glucose in the outsell. The insulin doesn't get into the cell. You have all these fatty acids that are getting in and then being oxidized into acetone acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate.  Those are all key tones. That's the ketogenesis with those production of those compounds. But happens is you have hydrogen eyeing, used causing acidosis, right? The acidosis in the cell causes the potassium to go out of the cell after settling. So with. Okay, so you have a high potassium out of the cell. You have all these ketones in the cell, you have to acidosis, right? And so it happens. You also have all the glucose on the outside.  The uptake of glucose within the kidneys is a roughly around 180 to 200 micrograms per deciliter. And so that's the threshold. So as soon as you hit that threshold, you're going to be spilling glucose in the urine, which is causing an osmotic diuresis. So you're going to be peeing, more. The potassium is going to be in the urine, right? You can lead to dehydration. Okay. So three things dehydration is going on. We have potassium is getting out of the cell and you have the acidosis. You have to  - Teresa's, right. All those things are playing because of lack of insulin. Okay, that's part of the physiology and that's what we have to treat. That's what's causing all of the symptoms, the drinking and the peeing and then not feeling well, the lethargy and the dehydration. These are questions. I just want you to read how much fluid would you administer as a bolus? How much insulin would you prefer to administer? And then what type of IV fluids you want to start and at what rate? So let's try. It was just giving fluids. First the dose.  To bolus children is 20 milliliters per kilogram. One time bowl is typically that bolus will increase the human dynamics. The hemodynamics don't improve, they need to a second bolus. What we don't want to do is do an aggressive hydration and kids. So after the initial bolus, what we're going to do is we're going to start a maintenance of 1/2 normal saline.  So, in order to calculate the maintenance fluid for Pediatrics, we use the following formula for up to 20 kg we use for ml per kg from 20 to 30 kg. We use two ccs or two milliliters per kilogram. And after 30 kg we use one cc per kilogram.  You talk about giving insulin one, major thing. You have to really consider before you ever give insulin is what the potassium is because there are already depleted potassium on our chem 7 earlier. I think it was 3.5. So with 3.5 you already have all testing, that's been shipped out of the cell. Typically, if all the potassium shipped out of tell you expect to be like a hyperkalemia like five or six. But now, the he's at 3.5 so he's been wasting. So if you were to give insulin now, what would happen is insulin has the effect of  Shifting the potassium back into the cells could become hypokalemia.  A gram per hour. We want to continue that. So our blood sugar was 4:30. So we're going to slowly decrease. The glucose between 50 and 100 mg per deciliter per hour. I don't care about the sugar. What I care about is the acidosis, the insulin is going to correct the acidosis. Because the what it's going to do. It's going to bind to The receptors. It's going to have the complete get into the cell, and it's also going to deregulate all the counter regulatory hormones. Like we talked about before the break down to liquid and gluconeogenesis.  And so process just have to start wrapping up again. Okay. So while this is going on glucose is going to decrease. So if I get a glucose at less than 250, I'm going to add sugar to my maintenance because what I don't want to do is get into a hypoglycemic State. What I want to do is I want to correct the acidosis and then you can monitor that by doing chem 7 s every two to four hours to see if you still have the acidosis by looking at the bicarb and also the anion gap.  Gap. And you generally do not want to stop insulin, add the sugar, while going through this whole process. Okay. So we're going to continue with little case scenario. So over the last hour, your patient starts complaining of headache. He's now unresponsive. He has fixed and dilated pupils heart, rate is 50 respirations, 8, and he's hypertensive.  What's happening? You got cerebral edema bad, bad bad. Why this occurs really don't know. Decrease the pressure. You can do one of a couple things. One you get mad at all. It's one milligram per kilogram. Bolus to give me a hypertonic saline for the respiratory, depression. You can intubate. Thank you for coming. And if you have any additional questions, please feel free to contact me.\",\n",

I see many type 2 diabetics, adopt, particularly, when the usual things to keep sugar levels in check fail. Does it work. Not as much as one would think you see? The reason the sugar levels are high is not because you just ate a carb loaded snack per se. It's uh,  a little more nuanced than that.  Let's start with what happens when you're not eating. Sugar supplies are low, but you still need fuel supporting. Our try and sized heads is hard work. The idea is your body reaches into the cookie jars jars. With an ace to keep everyone, happy. Of course. Everyone is not equal. The boss. That is the brain.  Gets first dibs on fuel and the brain is a power user of sugar. Hence, the need for cookie jars. Now the job that is particularly important when it comes to blood sugar levels, is the liver. The liver is the chief cook and bottle washer of the body, but his number one priority is to feed the brain. So when sugar supplies drop,  He makes a plan a big part of the plan involves synthesizing sugars from other things. Now, the manufacturing process is called gluconeogenesis. And when it happens in the liver, it's referred to as hepatic concurrently agenesis. The liver is pretty adapt at his job. A laundry list of things can be turned into sugar and condensed, certain amino acids, lactate and casserole.  I'll not have Patek, gluconeogenesis is the default mode. It's a bit like breathing, if it's not happening, it's tickets. So mother nature in her wisdom has set things up in such a way as to keep the liver pumping out sugar day and night and this.  You're eating when you eat the food, you eat makes fuel available for everyone now, exactly. Which fuels are found in the food, depends on the food Tech. But if the food contains carbohydrates, you're getting sugar some food supply, a trickle, others Supply truck, loads of the stuff. The point is the livers sugar supplies are no longer needed. So on.

Also, don't forget to check out the link below to find out how this guy reversed his diabetes. Turns out the diabetes industry is selling Us, fake research. But back to our topic, diabetes affects the manner in which the body handles digested, carbohydrates, if neglected diabetes can cause serious health complications, ranging from blindness.  This to kidney failure, approximately 8% of the population in the United States has diabetes. This means that approximately 16 million people have been diagnosed with the disease, based only on National statistics. The American Diabetes Association estimates that diabetes accounts for one hundred seventy eight thousand deaths, 54,000 amputees and 12 coma, 024 coma. Oh cases of blindness annually.  Blindness is 25 times more common among diabetic patients compared to non diabetics. It is proposed that by the year, 2010 diabetes will exceed both heart disease and cancer as the leading cause of death through its many complications diabetics. Have a high level of blood glucose. The blood sugar level is regulated by insulin, a hormone, produced by the pancreas, which releases it in response to food consumption, insulin causes the cells of the  body to take in glucose from the blood. The glucose is used as fuel for cellular functions, diagnostic standards for diabetes have been fasting. Plasma glucose levels greater than 140, mg /. DL on two occasions and plasma glucose greater than 200 mg /. DL following a 75 gram glucose. Load more recently, the American Diabetes Association lowered the criteria for diabetes diagnosis to fasting, plasma glucose.  Is equal to or greater than 126 milligrams /, DL fasting, plasma levels, outside, the normal limit require additional tests, usually by repeating the fasting plasma glucose test and if indicated giving the patient in oral glucose tolerance, test the symptoms of diabetes include excessive urination, excessive thirst and hunger sudden weight loss, blurred vision delay in healing of wounds dry and itchy skin repeated infections.  Sections, fatigue and headache. These symptoms. While suggestive of diabetes, may be due to other reasons. Also, there are two different types of diabetes type 1, diabetes, juvenile, diabetes, or insulin dependent diabetes, the cause of type 1. Diabetes is caused by pancreatic inability, to produce insulin. It is responsible for five to ten percent of cases of diabetes. The pancreatic islet of langerhans cells, which secrete  The hormone are destroyed by the body's own immune system, probably because it mistake them for a virus viral. Infections are thought to be the trigger that sets off this autoimmune disease. It is more common in Caucasians and runs in families. If untreated death occurs, within a few months of the onset of juvenile diabetes, as the cells of the body starve because they no longer receive the hormonal prompt to take in glucose. While most type 1 diabetics Are Young.  Hence, the term juvenile diabetes, the condition can develop at any age autoimmune, diabetes, can be definitely diagnosed by a blood test which shows the presence of anti insulin / on tile, etzel antibodies, type 2, diabetes, non-insulin dependent, diabetes, or adult onset diabetes. This diabetes is a result of body tissues becoming resistant to insulin. It accounts for 90 to 95% of cases often the pancreas.  Producing more than average amounts of insulin, but the cells of the body have become unresponsive to its effect due to the chronically high level of the hormone. Eventually, the pancreas May exhaust its overactive secretion of the hormone and insulin levels fall to below normal, a tendency towards type 2. Diabetes is hereditary, but it is unlikely to develop and normal-weight individuals, eating a low or moderate carbohydrate diet. Obese sedentary individuals, who eat poor quality diet space.  Ston refined starch, which constantly activates pancreatic, insulin secretion are prone to develop insulin resistance native peoples such as North American Indians, whose traditional diets did not include refined starch until its recent introduction. By Europeans have extremely high rates of diabetes. Up to five times the rate of caucasians blacks and Hispanics are also at higher risk, though. Type 2 diabetes is not fatal within a matter of months. It  Lead to health complications over several of years and cause severe disability and premature death as with type 1 diabetes. The condition is found. Primarily in one age group. In this case, people over 40, which is why it is often termed adult-onset. However, with the rise in childhood and teenage obesity. It is appearing in children as well. If neglected diabetes can lead to life-threatening complications such as kidney damage nephropathy.

I tell them, it's good news because now we know what you have and we can work together to make a plan to make you feel better.  Stephen lived in the Midwest for most of his life working as an accountant, but now he makes his home in South Florida, but Tha graffiti is just one of the things he loves to do.  Despite having Epi he's on the go from morning till night. I am an active person as soon as I get up at 7:00 7:30 in the morning. I'm out here. Working in my garden. Working on my boat. We're going fishing.  Steven works with his doctor to manage his condition. If you have Epi the first thing you need to do is understand what it is and how it's affecting your body.  The pancreas is about 8 inches long. It's located behind the stomach and it's a gland. And one of its jobs, is to help us digest our food properly nutrition from food is provided by Fats, proteins and carbohydrates, a healthy pancreas releases enzymes into the stomach to break down these nutrients. So our bodies can use them.  When the pancreas is not functioning properly, it's not making the correct enzymes that help us digest fats carbohydrates and protein. So if your pancreas is not working, we label. That is exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. That's epi.  Epi is caused when there's some kind of damage or disease going on in the pancreas. This could be due to a type of surgery or a medical condition. The most common cause of EPI and adults is chronic pancreatitis. The pancreas becomes inflamed and swollen and over time can be damaged, alcohol abuse smoking and blockage of the pancreas can play a role in.  Sonic pancreatitis Epi is also associated with cystic fibrosis, pancreatic cancer and diabetes, as well as surgical removal of the pancreas called a ping, create ectomy regla. Had a long career in healthcare in Cuba and the United States. She was in good health, until 2010, when she had an acute attack of pain. My daughter came and I  I told her you have to take me to the hospital because I have very, very hard pain. They suspect that I have cancer pancreatic cancer.  Regular did have a growth in her pancreas and underwent a pancreatectomy. It turned out. She did not have cancer a big relief, but without a pancreas, she developed diabetes. And Epi she works with her health care team to manage these conditions.  The common symptoms of Epi are oily. Foul-smelling diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain, weight loss and frequency of bowel movements.  These symptoms are the result of the inability of your stomach and intestines to absorb the food. You eat. So understand that if it's not being absorbed, it's going to be in your intestine and in your stool. So you're going to feel after you eat, you're going to feel bloated, you're going to have discomfort despite the severity of some of these symptoms. Some people can go for years with Epi without knowing  NG it, especially when they are already coping with another medical problem.  As a Young Man, Stephen already had that I just have condition called Crohn's disease. He had surgery that was meant to help. Instead. He started experiencing even more symptoms. He now believes. That's when he developed Epi. Well, no one talked about Epi back. Then I was just a Crohn's person, you know with all kinds of surgical issues the symptoms can mimic other conditions, but it's important to have the correct diagnosis so we can treat it.  The most effectively.  Until recently Hall, enjoyed excellent health and The Great Outdoors.  He and his wife, Anita, use their pool regularly and road bikes in nearby parks, have a good for walk case. I could do some surf fishing at the beach and I stayed pretty active.  But a year ago, he wound up in the emergency room with an acute pancreatic attack. I had discomfort right below my sternum area here and it pains started kept intensifying as the hours went on and never experienced so much pain. My entire life. Hi, Daddy. How do you feel? Despite his stay in the  Little Paul wasn't diagnosed with Epi until he went to see dr. Barkin, a gastroenterologist. A gastroenterologist, is a medical doctor who specializes in diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. This includes your esophagus stomach small and large intestine, or colon and your gallbladder liver and pancreas. Has your abdomen, feel the diagnosis begins with a complete medical history patients are asked about other health conditions medications.  Haitians were herbal products. You are taking eating habits recent weight loss or other symptoms. It's very important to get past any embarrassment about discussing bowel movements certain descriptions of how stools. Look, and smell can point to Epi being shy, could get in the way of getting the help. You need. The doctor did ask me about the consistency of the valve movement, whether they were loose, whether they were solid.  It is it ropey. Is it formed? Is it Loose? Is that watery is a whipped cream. Is it narrow? All of the above? You can imagine that there's a large proportion of us, which may not wish to tell a total stranger sitting across from us. That we now have loose stools. We now have urgency where we have to go to the bathroom that our stools have oil on it.  It that our gas is so bad that our neighbors don't want to be around us. But the truth is as a gastroenterologist. I can tell you we've heard it all before. There's really no reason to be embarrassed and it is vital that we get all the information so that we can treat you the best. We can. The diagnostic process might also include a stool sample, blood tests x-rays or other tests to look at the pancreas other procedures might be helpful as well. You can test the  Is by looking at it enzyme output and see that it's low. You can take pictures of the pancreas and see that its structure has been injured. Once it's clear that the problem is Epi. You can start working with your doctor to find a way to manage it.  AP. I cannot really be cured but we do aim to manage the symptoms to have, you feel better and also Aid in your digestion. Managing Epi begins with a partnership between you and your health care providers, the health care, professional may suggest changes to your diet or medicines or both in addition to a gastroenterologist and a primary care physician. It's a great idea to consult a registered dietitian. They can really work with you on your diet and formulate a meal plan.  Tailored to your specific needs.  Some people might be advised to eat more frequent but smaller meals for Paul. The focus is on eating foods that are high in calories. The reason being as I've lost a lot of weight. I went from Wayne almost at 170 pounds down to probably about 98 97 pounds. So I lost 70 pounds, which is a good bit of weight. That's why I'm on the the high calorie high fat intake diet to put that weight back on.  Oh, honey, Steven is coped with digestive problems. Almost all his life. So he knows he needs to be careful about what he eats and he relies on his wife. Marsha to keep him on track. She's a good cook. He's smart knows what I should be putting in me and prepares meals the way that are healthy for me.  Medication might be prescribed to replace the enzymes. Your pancreas no longer makes this is called pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy or pert. As with any medication. It's important to take pert. Exactly. As prescribed pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy needs to be taken. When we, therefore, it will allow absorption of the food nutritions that we just had taken.  To our meal. It not only has to be taken when we take a full meal, but it has to be taken. When we take a snack patients with Epi are also advised to avoid alcohol, alcoholic drinks. Can further damage in already damaged pancreas with someone with Epi. So you really want to avoid it. Absolutely avoid alcohol other than a toasted a wedding or whatever. Paul knows that another part of his treatment plan is making sure.  He gets regular check-ups, he prepares for them by talking with his wife.\",\n",
       " 'YdBXHm3edL8': \"Everything we've discussed so far involved, recognizing and tagging or engulfing Shady things that were found outside of cells. So outside of cells, we've seen things like a b-cell, a b cell has its membrane bat, membrane bound antibodies. This membrane bound antibodies may be one of these, my You might recognize something Shady out in the outside of the cell. And, of course, this part over here, as we know these, they all have a variable portion right over here. So this is specific to this Shady thing. Then this will be engulfed and then parts of it. Parts of it will be attached to an MHC 2 complex. So let me do that in a different color. So an MHC 2 complex, and  Then that will go to the surface that will go to the membrane of the cell to present itself. So that's an m, h 2 MHC, 2, complex. And so it has a little bit of the little little piece of of the Shady thing out here. We call this a little shady Peach. This is, this is this is an antigen. This is an antigen presenting cell here and then we've seen as especially if this is a b-cell then a helper T, cell that is also has a  Double portion that corresponds to that corresponds to this specific antigen.  So this would be a helper T cell right over here. So, this is a helper T helper cell. When it recognizes that, it'll start dividing into memory helper, T cells, and effector helper, T cells, and the effector helper T cells especially Ring, the Alarm bells, and start kind of accelerating the B cell replication. I guess you could say that the B Cell Activation and, and the theory is that this is kind of a double handshake process. But once again, this is what's occurring outside.  Out of cells. So when we found stuff outside of sales, we can gulp them and then we presented them on MHC 2. Complexes MHC 2 complexes. So now you're probably thinking, well, that's the outside of cells but you know, there's a meaty to there's these helper T cells, but we've also referred to cytotoxic T-cells. What do those do? And we've also if there's mac to there's probably an MHC one complex. What does the MHC one complex do?  And if we're, you know, we can recognize Shady things that are happening outside of cells, but don't Shady things sometimes happen inside cells. And what do we, how does our immune system respond to that? And actually, as you can imagine, all of those, all of those things are, will be entered in the rest of this video. So let's think about what's happening. Let's think about what happens when Shady things start to happen inside a cell. So, for example, for example, it might not even be due to a virus or due to a, a back to some type of bacteria could be.  The cell itself has gone awry. So let's say that this right over here is a cancer cell. So it's had some mutations. It's starting to multiply like crazy. So this is a cancer cell and the cancer cell because it had mutations going to produce. It's going to produce some weird, some weird proteins. So these cancer cells are going to produce some weird proteins. So every, every every cell with a nucleus in your body, and that's pretty much.  Much every cell except for a red blood cells has the has MHC. One complex has. And the point, the whole point of the MHC, one complex is to is to bind to Shady things that are produced inside of the cell Shady things that are produced inside of the cell and then present them to the membrane. So even in a malfunctioning cancer cell should be doing this, so then it will. So this MHC, one complex.  Bound to this bound to this the strange proteins that are produced by the the mutations inside of the nucleus and then it can present them and then it can present them. And so what you could imagine what the appropriate, immune spot response should be these things, these cancer cells. These cancerous chesed cells should be killed and actually let me label this properly. So that was m8c to you're presenting an antigen that was found those initially.  We found outside of the cells engulf and then taken out MHC 1 MHC 1. It's binding to Shady things inside the cell and then presenting it out. Now. This thing should be killed. Now as you can imagine, what's going to kill it. Well, that's where the cytotoxic T Cell comes into the picture. So the cytotoxic T cell is going to have, so that's a receptor right there. It'll have a variable portion. That's specific to this type of analysis.  Jigeon, and so it'll bind there and then once it does that it says oh boy. There's this all this Shady stuff here. These Shady proteins that are in produce this this cell and all the other ones, like it need to be killed. And so the cytotoxic T Cell will begin to replicate once again, like other other types of immune cells is going to replicate into the into the memory cells just in case, this type of thing, shows up 10 years in the future and also the effector cells. So this is memory.  And also effector and also, and also effector cells, effector cytotoxic T cells. And as we always know, the effector version is the thing that actually does something. It starts to actually affect things and what it is going to affect. It is going to start binding to things that are that are presenting the same antigen on top of as part of their Mr. On top of their MHC one complex. So this character right over here, so it's presenting.  Same antigen. It's presenting that same antigen on this MHC. One complex. And remember the variable portions need to match up. So let's say that this is this is an effector cytotoxic T cell  An effector, cytotoxic T cell and actually let me draw a little bit, a little bit different. So let me draw it. Like this. This is effector cytotoxic to toxic cease T-cell. Its receptor. Its variable portion is the one that's compatible with this antigen that's being presented, right over here. So, let me just label this again. This is the mhc1 complex. This is an effector cytotoxic cytotoxic T Cell. So who put the C? Therefore side?  Toxic. And what it does is it since you kind of latches on to the cell that needs to die, and it does, it not only does have this receptor interfacing with the MHC, one complex, but actually has a whole series of protein and I'm proteins and I'm not drawing this to scale, really, this would be much smaller relative to the scale of the cell that essentially latches on between the two. And I'm not going to go into detail but essentially forms what you could call an immuno synapse, which is the kind of where the two things are interacting with each other. And so when it identifies this and says, okay, I need a  kill this thing or I essentially, I need to make this thing kill itself. It starts releasing all of these molecules so it can release molecules like perforins. So it'll release these perforins, which will essentially cause gaps or holes to file, to, to form in the, in the, in the membrane of the cell that needs to die and then it can release other things, like granzymes that can go in and essentially cause this thing to kill itself. So the whole point of this video,  Is to appreciate, I guess what we haven't talked about yet. We had already talked about what happens when you identify Shady things outside of the cells and then how you can kind of bring them in and then present them and then use that to further activate the immune response. Now, we're talking about identifying Shady things inside the cells. Those get presented by MHC, one complex has and then the cytotoxic T cells recognize them and then Force the cell to kill themselves and this wouldn't just be cancer cells. This could also apply to a cell that has  Already been infected by a virus. So for example a cell like this already. So that's its nucleus. It's already been infected by some virus. It's already been infected by some virus. So it's hide. The virus has hijacked the cells replication Machinery in order to replicate itself. And so the proper immune response is hey, look I'm a I'm a I'm a virus making machine. I knew I should kill myself. So so it'll take some it'll read some of the antigens that are being produced.  It's inside of by virtue of by the viruses. They're going to bind to MHC. One complex has two MHC. One complex is so pieces of the virus, are going to bind to MHC one complex has, and then they're going to be presented on the surface. They're going to be presented do this way presented on on the surface. So this exact process can happen again.\",\n",

So, in the normal situation, you've got insulin.  Insulin binds to its receptor.  And Insulin also.  Prevents.  For the most part.  Fatty acids from moving on into the cell for a process of beta oxidation. So in the normal situation, what you have is you've got insulin hitting receptor causing glucose to go into the cell glycolysis is occurring, which the end result is pyruvate pyruvate. Then moves into the mitochondria. Krebs, cycle occurs, and you get boom ATP.  Great in the situation with diabetes, mellitus type 1, where you have no insulin being secreted or in the case of Diabetes Type 2, where you have a very strenuous State, high glucagon levels, High epinephrine, low insulin levels. What you have then is in either of these cases, no insulin secretion or insulin resistance and which case, and here's the key Point here, glucose can no longer come into  Cell there is no glycolysis. There is no pyruvate. This mode of energy source is cut off. Similarly. Insulin is no longer available to prevent beta oxidation. And so what you get at that point is you get quite a lot of palm at Alcoa.  Palm teal.  Co a through the enzyme Palma, Tokyo a transfer Ace now, no longer being inhibited or being disinhibited, and allowing quite a lot of these. Paul material Co has to go inside the cell. And of course, what happens, there is that they are chopped up into two carbon units. So that's called beta oxidation. So chop chop chop, chop, chop chop, and so you're getting quite a bit of two carbon units in here.  And this these high two carbon units can be used as, you know, acetyl Co a in Krebs cycle to make energy. It's not the best way of making energy, but they can make energy and those Ketone bodies are acetone.  Which looks like this. As you might recall acetoacetate, which looks like this.  And something called beta-hydroxybutyrate, which looks like this.  As you can see, these are a result of these two carbon units coming together and the breaking up of Ketone bodies. And so all of these actually are Ketone bodies. Acetone is very volatile. And so it can turn into a gas. And this is what you smell on the breath of somebody who is in ketoacidosis, you get this acetone smell, but particularly the thing I want you to pay attention to here. Is this carboxylic acid.  In and say, this is the whole carboxylic acid group right here, but particularly this 0 age group, because this proton comes off very nicely, and when it does, what you have left behind is the conjugate base, which is negatively charged, which is what's going to account for your anion gap. And if you want more information on the anion gap, please see our lectures on ABG interpretations and medical acid base.  So I think I want to review that and tell you exactly what I'm thinking. They're number one in dka, we have a lack of insulin.  And as a result of that, we see blood sugar's go up. Yes, but I think the biggest thing that you ought to pick up from that is number two, is that there is no in abyssion.  Of.  Fatty acid.  Transport.  Into.  Matrix of  My toe Conger area that's important because this means that fatty acids are pouring into the Matrix of the mitochondria, as we showed you on the last slide. That means beta oxidation is occurring. Which as you re, as you recall beta-oxidation is simply when you have these long chain fatty acids getting chopped up into two carbon units. These two carbon units are then being fed into the  Krebs cycle, but because there's so many of them. They start combining and forming these Ketone bodies in these Ketone. Bodies are acidic. So, where's the acid coming from? The acid is coming from the Ketone bodies, which are coming from the acetyl COA, which are coming from  The fatty acids, which are coming from the outside, which are being transported because there is no insulin. That's very important. Okay. So let's review that number one. What we're going to see here is low insulin.  and as a result of that, this is what we're going to see low insulin leads to  Ketone bodies.  Which is going to lead to.  Acidosis.  specifically, an anion  Gap.  Acidosis.  Which is going to lead to.  Increased potassium. Now. Why does that potassium go up? In this case? It goes up in this case because there is a proton, potassium exchange mechanism between the cells. And so, as protons are being increased in the serum, and they go into the cells potassium, have to leave the cells and go into the serum, to replace them. So, you'll see an increased potassium level, at least initially.  now, decreased insulin also leads to  High glucose.  High glucose is going to lead to dehydration.  And why is it going to do that? Well, because the glucose levels become so high that they exceed the reabsorption threshold in the kidneys. And so what you get, then is a osmotic diuresis.  That simply means that there's too many particles in the urine because of the excess glucose that the kidney, can't reabsorb it all and that excess osmotic pressure causes fluid to go with it. And that causes dehydration, that dehydration is going to do a couple of things. It's going to make all your potassium shift, out of your cells and get dumped. And so this kind of then leads back into this. But then as well, you get a  Total.  Body potassium.  Depletion even though your potassium level and your Serum is high, you're being depleted of your total body potassium. So what have we seen here? We've seen Ketone bodies. We've seen hyperglycemia. We've seen acidosis. We've seen dehydration. We've seen osmotic. Dehy diuresis, and we've seen total body, potassium, depletion, and along that you can also put total body phosphate depletion as  All. Now the dehydration can lead to increased creatinine because of renal failure.  And so this is what you typically see, in a patient who comes in with dka, they are at risk because they have low insulin. You can test their blood by checking for Ketone bodies. And because of this, you'll see an anion gap. Metabolic acidosis again. Look at our lecture on acid base, but what Ketone body show up as an anion gap. Metabolic acidosis, what that means is the anion gap, which is if you look at the chem 7,  Sodium subtracted, the chloride and the bicarb.  Will be greater than 12, and that's usually the first.\",\n",

I want to answer the most common questions we get asked every Day by people just like you, we're looking for straight answers when it comes to high blood sugar and diabetes can diabetes or high blood glucose levels, be reversed before I get into the specifics of my answer. I want to tell you some facts that you might not be aware of. Did you know that as the rate of obesity in our country continues to climb? So does the rate of type 2 diabetes, according to the Center for Disease Control and prevention as many as one in three us, adults will have  Diabetes by 2050 if current trends continue. And this trend is certainly not isolated to the us alone. In fact, there are many areas of the world where the growth rate for diabetes far exceeds that in the u.s. Basically, we're looking at a massive Health epidemic that is showing no signs of slowing down. Please let me emphasize how critically important it is that you take action regarding your health to prevent this from happening to you. Or if you already are suffering from diabetes.  How important it is to take the proper steps necessary right now for your health as any user of our effective blood sugar, stabilizer. Mela. BEC will tell you one of the problems with how pre-diabetes or type 2, diabetes is addressed and treated today. Is that few people including Physicians take into consideration the differences between early and advanced stages of diabetes people with what they call pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes have absolutely hi.  Hi, abnormal levels of blood sugar and high levels of insulin. This is caused by our body's resistance to insulin and a hormone meant to control your blood glucose levels, The Logical approach to this would be to increase our insulin sensitivity and improve our cellular function. Instead Physicians often prescribe oral anti-diabetes drugs made with old technology, which raise insulin levels in the blood, regardless of sugar levels. Even worse. Some of these drugs have proven to have serious side effects and a long-term.  Side effects are unknown. I think you will agree. The sounds like a very risky proposition for anyone concerned with their high blood sugar levels. So instead of fixing the cause of the problem, the bulk of the Expert Medical Community is happy to just treat a symptom of diabetes. The great news is I'm here to tell you today, that it is possible to reverse your diabetes or high blood sugar levels. Despite this common approach taken by the majority of the medical community. We all know the big drug companies and Pharmaceutical  Sue tackles have only one motivation when it comes to their products. Money at e, Global Natural Health. Our approach to the prevention reversing and treatment of your pre diabetes or type 2. Diabetes is to improve insulin resistance and restore your body's ability to react to insulin at the cellular level. Our approach has proven to be effective for thousands of our MB clients before you and is based on four very simple principles. The first principle is to take a  Shit. The worst thing you can do when faced with a decision is do nothing. The saying that comes to mind is is better to make the wrong decision then to make no decision at all. Sadly, often times when people are faced with a crisis. They simply can't make a decision because of fear procrastination or denial. Our second principle is based around a unique yet. Incredibly simple nutrition plan. A set of sensible, eating habits that do not involve any fad diets or deprivation.  Our third principle is a short-duration exercise program that can be accomplished in as little as four minutes a day. How does that sound? And our last principle is very critical and is based on published scientific studies that naturally support healthy blood sugar levels. You must have a sound nutritional supplement plan that contains the most effective ingredients to help control your blood sugar levels, as well as prevent painful side effects, such as neuropathy or loss of vision.  Like to call these natural and effective ingredients super nutrients and you simply must be making them a regular part of your diet.

       " 'Ylkj2ORlwXc': \"PCR stands for polycystic ovarian syndrome. It's a very common hormonal disorder. In fact, 1 in 10, women probably have it in the United States for this past month. I've been working out every single day and the devil is trying to test me. This has been such a journey all about education. It's all about learning what it is and how to improve your overall quality of life.  The Hallmarks of the disease are irregular periods and elevated levels of testosterone that can manifest in one of two ways. Either you have symptoms. So you have the hair and acne about a year and a half ago. I had noticed that I wasn't getting my period every single month at first. I thought it was my birth control. So I kind of went off of it, still wasn't getting it and so I thought it was stressed because I was graduating from college. I was getting ready to move to LA when everything kind of settled down. Still wasn't getting it. I went to the doctor one day.  And was just getting a normal checkup, and she had noticed that I had hair on my chin and she said, oh, you probably have PCOS. So for the next month, I'm going to be meeting women's health specialist other, women who have PCOS, and a doctor who specializes it and Women's Health and pretty much doing 360 on my lifestyle. Is it treatable? Is it curable? It's not curable per se, you can do things to treat it in terms of just actually you doing stuff with your body. I read that.  That you kind of reversed your PCOS with holistic practices. I was able to reverse my diagnosis and about 4 months through focusing on digestion and building blood since we're only doing a month-long kind of trial, you set up a special program for me. What does that consist of? So your program is going to consist of a supplement routine. So you're going to have detox cleanse the kidney liver and bowel. You're gonna have a candida cleanse. We're going to do it with the apple cider vinegar and then you're going to go into foods to eat foods to avoid. So some of those Foods  Going to be carbonated drinks, processed food, alcohol, high levels of Cafe, heart like breaking. It's my last night of drinking. Before I start my health plan tomorrow. I got some wine. We have some food. Let the shenanigans begin. Why? We go ahead and do that ultrasound right now. And so I can actually show you what the ovaries look like, automatically assumed that ultrasounds, you know, you have the jelly, the petroleum, and then you have a little machine and it goes around your uterus and your belly and then boom. But  But knowing that there's something that actually goes inside of you to see things that are happening on the inside. That's crazy to me and I didn't know that was a thing. You're going to feel a little bit of pressure. Okay? Yeah. Women with PCOS. They have tons of these little follicles. They're all really small. I don't see a dominant follicle that looks like you're going to ovulate and they're all kind of just ringing the outside your ovaries. Have the classic appearance of someone with PCOS when I met with dr. Bendixen, it was extremely overwhelming. All of these things that I didn't really know about PCOS, and it was a little  Scary. And I was just kind of like, oh God, and then getting a vaginal ultrasound and seeing my sister, and my ovaries and then learning that I had fibroid. That was the validation that this is real life for me. Now. The diagnosis is truly the crossroads because then you are able to say, do I want to treat this naturally or do I want to treat the symptoms and go with what the doctor wants to give me? I can only go to specific. People who take my insurance or else, it's going to cost an arm and a leg. I ended up going to one who's close to my job told them all.  Oh, I was recently diagnosed with PCOS. He walked outside took out. Some generic ass birth control and then was like, take this and you'll be fine and watch what you eat. It was so frustrating. I'm already like scared, you have these symptoms and then they're telling you, oh, like I can cause diabetes, and uterine cancer and I walked out of that doctor's office feeling so defeated. It took me five, doctors to get answers about this, don't settle for one answer.  Figure it out for yourself. If you have to it was important for me to meet with other women who have PCOS because I have a great support Circle. I have a great support group, but nobody else has PCOS. They say it takes a village to raise a child and I think coming into this and just realizing and being diagnosed with it that I have it. I feel like a child and I felt like I needed my Village to raise me. I'm going to make my apple cider vinegar. Drink, that's awful. But you know, what's going to make me feel better? It can't really be something that you just.  Low to lose the 20 pounds that you gained with it. It has to be for the rest of your life and that's intimidating. There's certain things that when I eat, I noticed my body kind of imbalance immediately like sugar for instance. So we're waiting for the shuttle and the devil is trying to test me. They small. So chocolaty and good. I learned the first week that your mind has control over a lot of things and so I kept telling myself. This is good for me. This is healthy. I'm going to get used to it at any time. I crave something. I would just drink water. Do you recommend any specific physical activity?  Don't recommend high intensity workouts walking for an hour. A day is really, really good. I've been working out every single day and one of the Beauties behind it is that I get to experience new places right now. We're hiking and Solstice Canyon in Malibu. I don't know if I've lost weight. That's not really my goal. My goal is to just feel good. So we get lunch on Mondays and Wednesdays and we had pizza cake and eat that luckily though, they had salad, but so I'm just taking like a bunch of cucumbers. This is literally what my fridge and system.  Kale brussel sprout, some type of salad stuff. Carrots. Eggs avocados ground turkey. Look at me sweet potatoes. At first, we're kind of just like another food for me. And then by week 3, it was like I'm going to treat myself and have a sweet potato. And like, all my friends was like, that's my treat yourself, a glass of wine is cheating yourself. So we have some cauliflower with drizzled olive, oil salt. Then we have all the ingredients to create the hummus. These things ended up becoming like treats.  Myself eventually because my body was getting used to the idea of feeding like all of these good proteins and actually not that bad. Hmm. You want to walk through life with the confidence that you are the hbic head bitch in charge until something happens with your body and you're like, oh I have to do a complete 360. And so you do and then you're kind of like, I'm going to cheat since my body thinks that it can control me. And then it reminds you actually know you're just walking through this thing called life for me. And so I ended up drinking. I don't  I have a hangover, but I do feel crappy and it made me realize how much I don't miss like the aftermath of drinking. So I came home a little early from work today because I'm feeling super, super crappy. My stomach hurts. I have a headache, but I'm thinking that maybe I'm gonna get my period soon. I came to realize that a lot of the reason why we're not actually getting our period is because we don't have  Nutrients in our body based on not eating properly or supplementing properly to produce enough blood to actually have our body be able to be okay. I'm going to give you a period, my period, I thought like oh when I do get my period eventually hopefully it will be regular and be. Hopefully I won't be upset but I was actually like very happy because I didn't get my period last month or the month before that. I thought that I would have to go on all of these like pills and medications and stuff and  You know, all I'm really doing is taking my birth control working out and eating healthy. Every week. I've had to do an apple cider vinegar face mask your face, is going to smell like apple cider vinegar. So I suggest doing this before, shower. Lay back flat on the ground with your feet, elevated for 10 minutes by and this is what your face is supposed to look like Cleopatra. Hmm, maybe not so much, but I do look like a ray of sunshine. People are Snapchatting me, and they're like, what are you using? Your skin is. So  All of a sudden and I'm like, I'm using Nicole Granado's essential oils healthy, eating minded, my business working out and drinking this water. That's it. So as soon as I found out about PCOS, I went into Facebook and I typed it and some of them have upwards of like 60,000 members. So you're constantly hearing other people's stories, you're hearing symptoms that they have so you can go in there and say, okay. This is what I'm experiencing right now. Is this normal as anyone else going through? This is this a part of it can for the condition and within minutes you'll have 30  Comment. So what it is or what it is. It's almost like there's not enough resources for us. So we're making we're making our own all together. Oh my God. Can you add? Yeah, I look at what I've been through and I look at my story and I think it's for a purpose. It's to help somebody else and to let them know you're not alone. This has been such a journey and it's been so exhausting in the entire time. I felt like I was so alone to talk to these women who not only  Gave me hope. We're so realistic about their symptoms and then invited me to the safe spaces were thousands and thousands of other women have PCOS gave me so much hope and it was so liberating and it felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. If you're having symptoms like acne or hair growth. Don't just assume that it's you. If you have irregular periods, don't assume that that's normal.  Normal, those are things that you should be talking to your gynecologist about because those things they may or may not be related to P cos but it's possible. And if they are, they're treatable. If I could have a conversation with myself before I was diagnosed. I would tell myself to listen to my body a lot. Earlier. I would tell myself that, you know, when my body says that something is going on this drastically because I'm not getting my periods. Every month. I'm getting excessive weight in such short time to go to a doctor and  And then if I walk out of that doctor's office, feeling defeated because I feel like they didn't give me the answers. Don't stop going to doctors until you find the answer.\",\n",

We're not allowing oxygen to get to the muscles. Okay, so, when oxygen is unable to get to the muscle, this muscle dies at that muscle dies, of course, we're looking here like at a ventricle here. If that ventricle dies, that muscle dies is not able to squeeze. We're not getting cardiac output. We're going to obviously be too, depending on the size of the damage either heart.  Her or death. As the heart muscle is no longer able to do its job. Okay, so it's an emergent disorder. It's something that has to be treated very quickly and we have to clean up this clot and allow that blood to flow and restore oxygen supply to that cardiac muscle. Okay. So when we talk about heart failure or myocardial infarction, or we want you to think of it as a vessel.  That's not right. I want you to think of it, a vascular. Let's do that. Vascular. When you think of as a vascular disorder. Okay, because what it really is is we're we have poor vessels.  And because of that, we're going to lose our blood flow. So things that are going to lead to in my are going to be things that are going to affect our vessels. Going to be vascular type disorders. Okay, so really quickly, let's just draw our heart.  And let's talk about a couple of the main arteries really quick. So here we have our aorta coming out. So, coming off the order here. We have our right coronary artery. It's going to kind of come down this way.  And then we have our left main coronary artery coming kind of this way.  And then off of that, we have our circumflex coronary artery.  Okay, that's going to kind of Supply the back end here and then coming off that circum flattered that left main coronary artery. We're going to have our left anterior descending coronary artery. Okay.  So left main left, main coronary artery.  Right. Coronary artery.  Left anterior, descending coronary artery.  And then circumflex coronary artery. Okay. So those are the main ones. So, what happens when we have a major heart attack is one of these main vessels is going to become occluded to the point of no blood flow distal to the occlusion. So right, coronary artery.  Left main coronary, artery left anterior, front of the heart descending, coronary artery.  And then we have our circumflex coronary artery. Okay. So those are our main vessels and those are the ones we kind of need to keep in mind because we can actually tell based on the EKG where the heart attack is, you know, so let's let's before I get ahead of myself. Let's dig into what we needed to get into. So as I said, it's really a it's a very common disorder. 735,000 Americans have a heart attack every year, based on information from the CDC now.  It's in the big risk factors are going to be high blood pressure, high LDL smoking. And these are key risk factors of heart disease. And the problem is about half of Americans have at least one of these three risk factors. So half of Americans, either have high blood pressure. High LDL, or are smokers. These are the three main leading causes of heart disease and heart attack. Now you can see it's very regionally distributed here, kind of in our South where there's more traditionally more.  Right Foods more sedentary Lifestyles less active, more smoking. These are areas that are going to be have higher incidence of heart disease and heart attack. Now, one in every four deaths in America Nationwide is due to heart disease. So 25% of every single death is based on heart disease. Okay, so it's again, it's something that we really need to understand. Now, like I said, we're going to we're going to talk about in my as a vascular.  Disorder. Okay. So let's talk about knowing that let's talk about why we're going to talk about as a vascular disorder. Once we talked about as a vascular disorder, going to understand how it happens. Some of the signs and symptoms. We're going to have some of the causes and then the therapeutic interventions, we're gonna be able to do. So modifiable risk factors. Like we said, smoking, we talked about hypertension.  Okay, so smoking of course is going to lead to atherosclerosis and thereby lead to vessel damage obesity as well. You're going to have higher lipids and that's going to lead to increased vessel damage as well stress more catecholamines in the system.  More cortisol that's going to lead to vascular issues and possibly to a mine hypercholesterolemia. Like we said hi ldls, High lower didn't lie. Low density lipoproteins is going to be to that occlusion, right? As we get that high LDL. We're going to build up plaque at our vessels impede blood flow.  And that's going to be the cause for my diabetes, not diabetes, obviously leads to vascular damage. Okay?  As we have that vascular damage those vessels become weak. We may have increased blood sugar's more often and that's going to lead to vascular damage as well. Hypertension, of course as well at the row sclerosis hardening of the walls and more pressure trying to go through the system at any one point and that too is going to lead to vessel damage and possible in my in death as well. Okay. So again vascular disorder and these are common things are going to lead to vascular damage, okay?  Now, there's a couple different types of am I? Okay? And when we talk about Mi again, we're talking about myocardial infarction, and there's some ways that we can see that one of the best ways to notice an MI is going to be on an EKG. Now, we're gonna be able to see you on the EKG.  The st-elevation. Okay, so we'll talk about st-elevation. Myocardial infarction. You may have heard this term stimmy before, that's what a stimmy refers to st-elevation myocardial infarction. Now, there's another type of myocardial infarction and that's a non-st elevation Mi or nstemi. Okay. So an instant you're not going to see these EKG changes, okay.  Specifically the St elevation. However, on a on a on a stimmy, you're going to notice these EKG changes. And the reason for that is because what happens to cause this St elevation is that you have complete occlusion, complete occlusion of a major coronary vessel now.  Once we have that complete occlusion of one of these major vessels that we talked about a minute ago. We're leading it becomes incredibly emergent situation. Okay. So what we have here is our ukg, right. We have our p q, r s and t, Okay. So this would be a normal EKG, someone just normal all about. And then what happens is as they develop this complete occlusion of this major vessel, is this s  T segment is be going is going to begin to rise and then it kind of becomes one big wave as it progresses. Okay. So here we have our s and RT are both elevated. So rather than seeing any of this, this electrophysiological change here, we're going to see this S/T kind of just becomes one big wave.  And that's, that's the st-elevation, okay.  So that's kind of the EKG changes. You're going to notice on these patients and depending on where the actual.  Infarction is is going to depend on what lead? You're going to see this in. Okay, so really it's inferior posterior heart attack or depending where the heart attack is. It was going to tell you what lead you're going to actually see the change in on your 12-lead EKG. Now we don't talk about 12 feet a lot here because it's not necessary for NCLEX. But once you understand 12-lead and kind understand these EKG changes are going to see, you'll be able to look at a 12-lead EKG and you'll be able to know exactly what coronary artery is a  Did buy this because the St elevation is going to show up in the lead that corresponds to the artery. That is affected. Okay.  Now some of the other things were going to do with a patient to suspect to have an MI is we're going to draw what's called cardiac injury profile or cips is what we'll call them.  So if a patient comes in with an abnormal EKG coming with chest pain, we're going to run our CI peas. Okay? Cardiac injury profile. So if you want to sound really smart and clinical or something say we give any cfps on this patient.  Okay, and those are kind of three. Major labs are going to draw its troponin, CK, and B, and myoglobin.  Now let's talk a little bit about each of these individually. So troponin, we're specifically going to draw troponin, die and troponin. T. The one you're going to see most often looked at and referred to as going to be your troponin. I okay. These to mr. Pony, and your opponent ER found specifically in cardiac muscle and the released when there is cardiac muscle damage, so because of that, it's the most sensitive to cardiac damage. So that's one of the questions that you may see on in clicks is which laboratory values most.  Sensitive to myocardial infarction or cardiac damage. And that's going to be your troponin and specifically. Like I said, you're going to refer probably most often to component. I now the level of your troponin is going to Peak at 12 hours. So what you'll see is someone has a heart attack. That's your opponent. Will rise. Rise, rise after about 12 hours. It's going to get to its peak level and then it will begin to lower down again, and it may stay somewhat elevated though. So again troponin die, troponin T are the laboratory values. You're going to be looking at most  Specifically with myocardial infarction. Another one going to look at is ck-mb. Creatinine kinase MB, those few different kinds of creatinine. Kinase. You're going to have kind of seen bbb-but specifically for heart damage. You're going to look at em be and that might be a question as well. Which of these laboratory values is is checked, you know with with myocardial infarction or something like that, may give you seek a and b c, KB, B, and you're correct.\",\n",
       " 'z0Pt-x8eKkM': \"Insulin is the hormone normally made in the pancreas that stimulates the flow of sugar glucose from the blood into the cells of the body glucose provides the cells with the energy they need to function.  There are two main groups of insulins used in the treatment of diabetes human insulins and analog insulins made by recombinant DNA technology.  The concentration of most insulins available in the United States is 100 units per milliliter a milliliter is equal to a cubic centimeter. All insulin syringes are graduated to match this insulin concentration.  There are four categories of insulins depending on how quickly they start to work in the body after injection. Very rapid acting insulin or rapid-acting insulins intermediate acting insulins long-acting insulin.  In addition some insulins are marketed mixed together in different proportions to provide both rapid and long-acting affects certain insulins can also be mixed together in the same syringe immediately prior to injection.  A very rapid acting form of insulin called Liz bro. Insulin is marketed under the trade name of Humalog a second form of very rapid acting insulin is called as part and is marketed under the trade name novolog.  Humalog and novolog are clear liquids. They begin to work ten minutes after injection Peak at 1 hour after injection and last 3 to 4 hours in the body Humalog and novolog are used as bolus insulins to be given 15 minutes before a meal most patients also need a longer-acting insulin to maintain good control of their blood sugar Humalog and novolog.  Can be mixed with mph.  Check your blood sugar level before giving Humalog or novalog your doctor or diabetes educator will instruct you in determining your insulin dose based on your blood sugar reading and anticipated meals and exercise always check the bottle before drawing up the insulin. If the solution is cloudy discard the bottle if you are mixing Humalog or novalog with a longer-acting insulin always drop the Humalog.  NovoLog first to maintain the Purity and Clarity of the Humalog and novolog Solutions  Another solution of insulin that acts rapidly is called regular or our insulin. This insulin does not act as quickly as Humalog or novalog.  Regular insulin is a clear colorless liquid. It begins to work 30 minutes after injection Peaks at three to five hours and last 6 to 10 hours in the body regular insulin is usually given 30 minutes before a meal it can also be mixed in the same syringe with longer acting mph or given separately immediately after each other.  Large and cannot be mixed with it.  Regular insulin is the most stable of all the different types of insulin but unopened regular insulin is best refrigerated always check the bottle before drawing up the insulin. If the solution is cloudy discard the bottle if you are mixing regular with a longer-acting insulin always drop the regular insulin first to maintain the Purity and Clarity of the regular solution.  examples of intermediate acting insulins are NPH  intermediate acting insulins are cloudy suspensions of crystalline insulin. They need to be gently rotated between the hands before being used. They begin to work 1 hour after injection Peak at 6 to 12 hours after injection and last 20 to 24 hours in the body. The intermediate insulins are often given before breakfast. They may also be given at bedtime depending on your  Glucose reading they can be mixed in the same syringe with regular list bro and asked part insulins. Another long-acting insulin is called glargine insulin. It is an insulin analog manufactured by recombinant DNA technology.  Unlike other long-acting insulins glargine insulin is a clear solution of insulin it begins to work about one hour after injection.  There is no pronounced Peak small amounts of glargine insulin are released slowly to provide a relatively constant amount of insulin in the body over 24 hours glargine insulin cannot be mixed with any other insulin a change to glargine from NP age should be done under the close supervision of your medical team.  There are three stable pre mixed formulations of insulin one contains 70% of NPH insulin and 30% of regular insulin another formulation contains 50% of NPH and 30% of regular insulin the third contains 75% of the mph and 25% of Humalog.  These mixtures begin to work around 1/2 hour after injection peek into to eight hours and last up to 24 hours in the body as these pre-mixed insulins contain Rapid or very rapid acting insulin. They should be taken before meals as directed by your medical team.  With your doctor's instructions several combinations of two different types of insulin can be mixed together in the same syringe and given as one injection once mixed the combined injection must be given immediately or the effect of the regular component of the injection will be diminished.  The rapid acting insulin list bro, ask part and regular can be mixed with a longer acting NPH insulin glargine cannot be mixed with any other insulin.\",\n",
       " 'Z36dUduOk1Y': \"Are membrane.  Membrane-bound.  Antibodies.  And I'll talk a lot more about antibodies. You've probably heard the word. And, you know, do you have antibodies for such-and-such flu or such and such virus and we're going to talk more about that in the future, but you can really just antibodies are just proteins. Sometimes they'll you know, the they're often referred to as immunoglobulins. Immuno globule ins teaching biology really stresses my the spelling part of my brain, but these are essentially equivalent equivalent words. Antibodies are mean, you gold.  Mm, you know globally club uhlans and the really just proteins. Now, B cells have these on the surface, on the surface of their memories. These are membrane-bound. Usually when people talk about antibodies. They're talking about free antibodies that are going to be that are going to just be floating, floating around like that. And I'm going to go, I'm going to go into more detail on how those are produced. Now, what's really, really really, really, really interesting about these membrane bound?  Antibodies. And these B cells in particular. Is that a B cell has one type of membrane bound antibody on each b-cell, right? Each be so, you know, that's one b-cell and let me draw another b-cell here. So let's say that this is another be cell right here. It's going to also have antibodies but those antibodies are going to be different. So then we'll focus on where they're different. So let me just draw them the same color first and then we'll focus on where they're different.  So that's one antibody membrane-bound. That's another antibody membrane-bound. These are both B cells. They both have these antibodies on them. Now. The interesting thing is is that from one B cell to another be cell. They have a variable part on variable part on this antibody, that can take a bunch of different combat that can take on a bunch of different forms. So this one might look like that.  And that and these are the some of these long, I'll go into more detail on that and like that, that so the colors. Well, I'd let me do it like she let me do it then. So there's the fixed portion. You can find, it is green for any kind of antibody and then there's a variable portion. So maybe this guy's variable portion is, I'll do it in pink and every one of the antibodies bond to his membrane are going to have that same variable portion now, but this different B cells going to have different  Portions. So I'll do that in a. Let me do it in a different color. I'll do it in magenta. So his variable portions are going to be different.  Are going to be different just like that. Now he has 10,000 of these on a surface and every one of these have the same variable portions, but they're all different from the variable portions on this b-cell. And there's actually there's actually 10 billion different combinations of variable portions. So there's 10 to the 10th or 10 billion combinations.  Combinations of variable.  Portions. So the first question and I haven't even told you what the variable portions are good. For is how do that many different combinations, arise. Obviously, these proteins are maybe not. So obviously all these proteins that are in part of most cells are produced by the, the genes of that sells. So if I draw, you know, this is the nucleus. It's got its got DNA inside the nucleus. This guy has a nucleus. It's got DNA inside the nucleus, if these guys are both B cells and they're both coming from the same.  Online. They're coming from the same. I guess, ancestry of cells, shouldn't they have the same DNA, shouldn't they have the same DNA? And if they do have the same DNA and I'll put a big question mark there. If they do have the same DNA, why are the proteins that they're constructing different? How do they change? And this is what wiii find B cells and you'll see this is also true of T-cells to be fascinating is in their development.  Went in there Hamato poesis. I always have trouble of pronouncing that word. But that's just the development of these lymphocytes at one stage in their development. There's just a lot of shuffling of the portion of their DNA that codes for here for these parts of the protein. There's just a lot of shuffling that occurs. So in most, you know, most of, when we talk about DNA, we really want to preserve the information, not have a lot of shuffling. But when these lymphocytes, when these B cells are  Earring at one stage of their maturation or of their development. There's intentional reshuffling of the DNA that codes for this part and this part and that's what leads to all of the diversity in the variable portions on these membrane-bound immunoglobulins, and we're about to find out why there's that diversity. So there's tons of stuff that can infect your body, you know, there's, you know, all sorts of viruses are Ivar are mutating and evolving and so are bacteria.  You don't know what's going to enter your body. So what what the what the immune system has done through b cells and we'll also see it through T cells. It says hey, let me just make a bunch of combinations of these things that can essentially bind to whatever I get to. So, let's say that there's just some new virus. Let's say there's just some new virus that shows up, right? The world has never seen this virus before and you know, this beasts a little bump into this virus and the virus will.  Attached. And then another b-cell will bump into this virus and it won't attach and maybe a several thousands of B cells will bump into this virus and it won't attach. But since I have so many B cells having so many different combinations of these variable portions on these receptors, eventually. One of these B cells is going to bond. Maybe it's this one. Maybe it's this one and he's going to bond.  He's going to bond to part of the surface of this virus. It could also be two part of a surface of a new bacteria or part of a surfaced for some foreign protein and the part of the surface that it brines on the bacteria. So maybe it binds on, you know, that part of that bacteria. This is called an epitope.  Epitope. So once this guy binds to some foreign pathogen and remember the other B cells won't only the particular one that had the particular combination, one of the 10 to 10th. And actually there aren't 10 to 10th combinations during their development. They weed out all of the combinations that would bind to things that are inside of your that are essentially you that shouldn't be that there shouldn't be immune response to. So we could say self.  Self responding.  Combinations weed it out.  So there actually aren't 10 to the 10th 10 billion combinations of these something smaller than that. You have to take out all the combinations that would have bound to your own cells, but they're still a super huge. Number of combinations that are very likely to bond at least, to some part of some pathogen of some virus or some bacteria. And as soon as one of these B cells binds it says, hey guys, I'm the lucky guy who happens to fit exactly this brand new pathogen. He becomes activated. He becomes activated.  It.  After binding to the new pathogen. And I'm going to go into more detail in the future. In order to really become activated. You normally need help from helper T cells, but I don't want to confuse you in this video. So in this case, I'm going to, I'm going to assume that activation can only occur or that it just needs to respond. It just needs to essentially be triggered by binding with the pathogen, but we'll see. In most cases. You actually need the helper T cells as well. And we'll discuss why that's important. It's kind of a  Safe mechanism for your immune system, but once this guy gets activated, so this is the activated guy. He's going to start cloning himself. He's going to heat this. Hey, look, I'm the guy that can match this. This, this, this virus here. And so he's going to start cloning himself. He's going to start dividing and repeating himself. So let me just so there's going to be multiple versions of this guy.  Multiple versions of this guy and not only are there multiple versions of that guy. So they have the receptor, the membrane, they have 10,000 of these only drawing one or two on each membrane. So they all start to replicate. And they also differentiate differentiated means they start taking particular roles. So there's two forms of differentiation so they can go into. So, you know, many, many, many hundreds, or thousands of these are going to be produced and then some are going to become memory cells.  Memory cells which are essentially just cells B cells that stick around a long time with the perfect receptor on them, with the perfect variable portion of their receptor on them. Let me draw a couple of them right there. So that is a memory cell.  So that right there is a memory cell. So some will be Memory cells and they're going to be in higher quantities and they were originally. So if there's if this guy invades, our bodies, 10 years in the future, they're going to have more of these guys around that are more likely to bump into them and start and get activated. And then some of them are going to turn to effector cells and effector cells are generally cells. That actually do something so effector cells.  Effector cells and what the effector cells do, if they turn into, they turn into antibody, they turn into these effector B cells or sometimes they're called plasma cells. They're going to turn into into antibody factories and to body.  Factories. And the antibodies are going to produce are exactly this. This combination the day that was that they originally had being membrane-bound. So they're just going to start producing these antibodies that we talked about with the exact. So they're going to start spitting them out. They're going to start spitting out. These antibodies are going to start spitting out tons and tons of these proteins that are uniquely able to bind to the new to the new pathogen. This new thing in question.  And they're going to they're uniquely able to bind. So an activated effector cell will actually produce 2,000 antibodies a second. So you can imagine if you have a lot of these you're going to have all of a sudden a lot of antibodies floating around in your body and going into the body tissues and the value of that and why this is a humoral system is all of a sudden you have all of these viruses that are infecting your system. You have all of these viruses that are infecting your system, but\",\n",
       " 'z9aeU2Qw1S4': \"It's not always that easy attitude. How does the patient feel about insulin? Is there something in their background family members? That have been started on insulin? That may sway their decision on starting insulin. How about skills? Can the patient? Read numbers can the patient? See well enough to draw up an insulin dose. Does the patient have sufficient manual dexterity to handle a vial and syringe. And can the patient take glucose readings correctly. All of these. They seem simple for a professional of patients, first starting insulin, and learning how to manage their blood glucose has. This might be a challenge for them. Lifestyle does the patient understand appropriate nutrition. Does he know how to read labels? Does the patient exercise, which may influence his blood sugar readings and does the patient have any family support to help them out with this concept of insulin management.  A recent study was done and looked at insulin. I have patients and why they might be averse to the possibility of insulin therapy. In the dawn, study issues such as a perceived loss of control. Over one's life, poor self-efficacy about insulin therapy and personal failure, were all areas that played a role in whether they might or might not be able to handle insulin therapy.  Perceived disease severity sometimes patients, feel that once they start insulin. This actually means that their condition has worsened to a point where it's non-reversible injection related anxiety. Approximately. 50% of patients are afraid of an injection and perceived lack of positive gain that they may not believe that insulin will actually help them improve their health, their energy and reduce complications.  When we look at the current practice paradigms, how do we actually start people on therapy for their diabetes? That might be out of control. This is the current practice Paradigm. We almost always start people on diet and exercise first, if their blood sugar's aren't under control after a month or two, we'll usually add a single agent of mono therapy and from there Step It Up combinations of oral agents. And then finally insulin, there are problems with this though. Glycemic.  Might not be met mono therapy and many studies has been shown to not be effective for the long-term treatment failure, fails to address all the impairments in the stepwise approach makes patients, feel that. Once they end up on insulin, as if they have failed, rather than taking into consideration that any or all of these agents may be needed to fully control. Someone's diabetes, glucose toxicity can interfere with treatment response and financial considerations for each patient.  Patient needs to be taken into account. It is possible that some of the agents, especially the newer agents may be more expensive than what they are able to provide. And that insulin therapy may be able to handle and manage their disease in much more efficacious manner.  This was one very interesting study done from Kaiser Permanente group and what it showed was. How long does it actually take Physicians to escalate treatment? Is there some inertia involved in moving therapy along? So if you take a look at the top of this slide diet, and exercise, for these patients wasn't enough their average A1C, at that point was 8.6 percent and the number of  Once that their A1C was above 8% was eight point seven months, taking this further. When sulfonylureas alone were used. The average A1C was 8.8% for twenty point five months before any therapy was escalated on Metformin alone. Similar findings an A1C of 9.1% with fortune and a half months before any therapy was changed. And even when they were on combination, metformin and sulfonylurea.  The average A1C was 9.6% for twenty five point, six months before any changes were made. All this tells us that we're still probably not advancing therapy and type 2 diabetes at a rate that would be optimal for patients that allows them to reduce their complications and best manage their disease.  This slide shows an algorithm first presented by David Nathan and Diabetes Care. That shows us a stepwise approach to instituting therapy for type 2 diabetes. As certainly recommended by a number of bodies lifestyle recommendations are always first along with metformin, which is inexpensive has less weight gain and many times weight loss as well.  Very effective Lucas management, Step 2 offers. Now a number of therapeutic options and everything from adding basal insulin sulfonylureas tzd such as pioglitazone or glp-1. Agonists are now in this step to algorithm in addition. Any other one of the combinations can be added to the first agent in order to make this even more effective and  Lee step 3 would be adding intensive insulin in order to optimally manage the patient's disease.  This just gives a little more detail at what point in time. Would you actually want to incrementally increase and make these additions? If you use an A1C, that's greater than 7% as your target for initiating therapy and then use the target of seven percent or less as your trigger point for making the changes. Usually at a rate of every two to three.  Three months, following this value. You can then see how you would rapidly achieve optimal glucose control.  Okay, I'm going to turn it over to Stephanie now, to get us started on basal insulin.  Let's look at some reasons when you're looking at your patient to start initiating. Basal insulin. One of the primary goals to look at is the A1C is not less than seven other things to look at. The patient is not prepared or able to take multiple daily injections at this time. So what this requires is a discussion and a plan with the patient ahead of time. To determine is this somebody who may need basal bolus.  But they're only willing to take one injection at this point. When you're looking at the fasting glucose is that glucose consistently above a healthy goal. When we give basal insulin, especially when we give that basal insulin at bedtime, it will help decrease that fasting glucose. And that's one of the benefits of starting. A basal insulin as well. The person is willing to monitor their fasting glucose again. Typically were giving that basil at bedtime and knowing what that  Fasting glucose is the patient's able to titrate it home, or when they call you, you are able to titrate their insulin based on the fasting glucose results. This is also the possible beginning of starting basal bolus therapy.  Basal insulin can be given once or twice a day. Most likely the patient is started. In a once a daily. Once daily regimen with type 2 diabetes. We can use a basal insulin in combination with the oral diabetes medications and we have several basil insolence to talk about glargine dead. Amir and NPH insulin.  Let's look at these little more closely when we look at glargine and dead Amira. As you can see these two insulins physiologically, mimic more, like our own pancreas, would produce basal insulin mph has a much shorter duration and also has a peak. So, when again, when we look at physiological response glargine and deta mirror fit that bill much better a couple of concerns or concerns.  Relations with guardian and dead. Amir both of those insulins cannot be mixed with any other insulin. So if a patient does require to give simultaneous bolus insulin, the patient needs to be instructed to give two separate injections to separate syringes another important teaching point with basal insulin, many patients feel. Once they start insulin, that that's going to affect any food that they eat an important piece with glargine and dead. Amir. They work too.  Slowly to affect any food. So patients need to be reminded to eat healthfully. When it comes to cost, you can see mph is less expensive than large in and did a mirror. However, I just want to remind you that both of these insulins do have patient Assistance programs. So patients that meet certain Financial criteria can actually get those insulins at a three-month Supply sent to your office.  This gives us a visual to contrast mph in Dedham Your Glory Gene. And again, you can see the duration of both of those insulins data. Mirroring. Both glargine is up to 24 hours and pH really lasts about 10 to 14 hours. And any time you have a peaking insulin such as mph, you run the risk of hypoglycemia.  These insulins come in insulin pens which are very easy for the patient to use. So especially if their insurance pays for something like this, I would encourage you to consider starting the patient out on an insulin pen.  I'd like to ask you for a moment to reflect on a couple of these words that you see before, you know, villain Humulin analog, what does no villain and Humulin mean to you?  Many people think this is actually one type of insulin. When in fact, these are brand names for three different types of insulin. Novo. No villain is Novo Nordisk version of mph regular or 70/30 insulin.\",\n",
       " 'z_3S2_41_FE': \"These are my assistants Coleman and Phil, they're both around the same height weight and consequently, they have the same body mass index or BMI. But if you split them, open Damien Hirst style or just compare the results of their body scans. You can see a slight difference. Bill has more body fat than Coleman and Coleman has more muscle than fail. Although BMI is a popular, measure to assess. If a person's weight, might be, putting them at risk for obesity-related diseases. Its results can be  be pretty misleading and less nuanced. Then we'd like. So the BMI is an index that looks at somebody's body weight divided by their height. So the formula is the body weight in kilograms divided by the height and M2, 18.5 and below is underway. 18.5 to 24.9 is your Healthy range. 25 to 29.  Nine is overweight and a BMI over 30 is classified as obese with the idea being that the taller. Somebody is the more they should weigh. Kind of weird, how a single decimal point can separate being overweight from being obese, major problem with using BMI as a marker of Health, when it comes to body weight. Because it penalizes, you, if you have a lot of muscle and you're healthier, let's use. Professional athlete, Marshawn, Lynch.  CH as an example, he's 511 215 pounds and his BMI is 30. He be categorized as obese. That's because BMI doesn't distinguish muscle from fat. We're here. We're really concentrating on how much muscle does somebody have because muscle is the metabolic engine. It's the thing that burns calories. And the more muscle you have, the easier it is for you to stay at a lower more healthy body fat percentage. Not necessarily a BMI.  And this way BMI is reliability as an indicator of Health breaks down for athletes like Lynch. There are several more variables that can influence. The interpretation of BMI things like age, gender and ethnicity, while BMI is a useful measure for a large population study. For example to compare relative obesity rates from state to state it becomes more problematic when you use it to determine an individual's help.  The body mass index was introduced in the early 19th century. This guy who created the formula, I am. So sorry. I'm going to butcher his name, Lumber and all fridge. Accurately wasn't even a physician could play was a Belgian mathematician. His reason for creating a formula was study the normal, man. Not obesity. It's you shifted to study obesity because of, and selkies in 1972 Keys. Use the formula and his indices are relative weight and obesity study.  Name the formula to body mass index. And from there, the new measure, caught on among researchers over the years. It's used in the health, professional field Group and it's pretty much stuck around since it's easy to use cheap fast and it's right about 80% of the time. So even though BMI has stuck around for more than 200 years. It's not the be-all and end-all health indicator. There are more effective ways to assess body composition, and overall health Hydro.  Weighing or underwater weighing is an option along with MRI scans. And using waist to hip ratio, medical tests, like checking blood pressure glucose levels, resting metabolic rate, can further give a clearer picture of overall health. I went to George Washington University and lab director. Todd Miller showed me another way using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry or dexa image. It measures total body composition including fat Mass lean body mass and bone density. So the green  Is the areas where the body is very lean, the yellow are areas of moderate fat and the red are areas of high fat. But this person was here, July 3rd. She had 72 pounds of fat, and 109 pounds of muscle. And in December 27th of this year. She had 37 pounds of fat and 115 pounds of muscle using this chart. You can see if this person stepped on a scale. They only see they lost 29 pounds. What the scale wouldn't say is that.  They gained six pounds of muscle and BMI wouldn't say that either. So even if two people have similar bmis that one number will never, truly give either of them. The full picture of their overall, well-being, BMI is an indirect measurement of one aspect of an individual's health. So while it can be helpful, it shouldn't be the only way to understand the human body.\",\n",
       " 'ZA8GzhFh_CQ': \"What's up, guys? Jeff cavaliere. Athleanx.com. We're going to continue our Series today of the eight best exercises this time covering the eight best bodyweight exercises you can do and we're going to mix it up guys. It's not just strength training exercises but conditioning as well. If you want to be an athlete you got to train like an athlete we're going to combine both strength and conditioning to cover each of these eight exercises. And guess what? We're going to cover your whole body to and the only piece of equipment that you'll need to manipulate your own body weight for a few of the exercises just a single pull-up bar guys. If you don't have one already invest in one 10 to The inbox is well worth your development here. So let's get it started the 8 best bodyweight exercises you can do. All right, let's kick this list off the right way with the old classic pull up. There's no way that we can get through an eighth best exercises list without including this one because it simply is one of the best things you can do for your upper body and it is a great body weight option. Now, let's say you are not getting enough out of a pull-up or you're looking for something more advanced or more difficult. We can involve more muscles in the exercise by simply switching our grip and the thing.  Here guys, you'll see the common theme with all these exercises. There are certainly ways to modify to make these exercises more of a regression to make them easier or make them a progression to make them harder and being able to master that as the key because you never want to get stagnant with any of your upper body exercises or any of your body weight exercises period so here if I switch my grip up to what we call the Commando pull up now, I've got a core involvement because my body wants to twist and one side as soon as you take this over under grip, you can't let that happen. We're going to let our core kick in and actually help us to stay.  Table while we pull up to each side of the bar, of course a little bit extra for involvement here a little bit of biceps never a bad thing here when we're trying to amp up the intensity of the exercise. Let's stick with that theme though as we move to number two. Let's get those biceps a little bit more involved. And of course, let's get that core a little bit more involved to just by flipping the grip all the way over to what we call a chin up Neil and you can see as I do this exercise. It's two parts. The first part is getting my head up over that bar through a natural chin up which we know that positioning will work our biceps a lot more than  It would in a normal pull up positioning and of course, let's involve those abs as well by finishing with the Neo guys are great way to get more out of your body weight exercises and training is to put more in them and you can see this exercise gives us that opportunity a few more muscle groups make the movement a little bit more complex, but you're going to get the rewards that you're looking for much quicker. Okay. Let's throw the equipment away all together and shift to the other half of our body our legs and by far one of the most difficult lower body exercises you can do is evaluate exercise.  It's a slick floor Bridge curl. You can see all you need to do is put on a pair of socks find some kind of a slick floor which here I'm using tile you can use a wood floor anything that you can actually just slide your socks on and you've got one of the best glute and hamstring developers in Your Arsenal the great thing about the Slick floor Bridge curl is you're actually training your muscles to work the way they're supposed to work. You don't ever want to have your hamstrings trying to work without the help of the glutes. You see far too often when the hamstrings have to do all the work. That's when you get a  String injury let the bigger stronger glue stick in and this exercise forces you to do that by holding your Bridge up high and then initiating the hamstring curl, of course, we can't neglect the front side of our legs in this exercise gives us an opportunity to make sure we don't this is our levitation squat. The levitation squat is actually a really good exercise for those particularly those that have a hard time maybe even attempting a pistol squat the pistol squat puts our leg out in front of us, which makes it a lot harder for us to even be  Balance it's not necessarily that you don't have the single leg strength to execute it. But you might not have the single leg strength combined with the balance to execute it. Now. Can you progress yourself to a pistol squat by all means? Yes, and you can actually sell spot Yourself by holding on to a bar when you perform it until you build a adequate strength and balance to do it, but I'm going to tell you I still love the levitation Squat and makes my knees feel a little bit better and I'm able to actually push and get a little bit more out of every single rep and therefore for me. I put it right at the top of my list.  Okay, you knew nobody waitlist would ever be complete without some variation of a push-up, right? We know that we're going to have to Target our chest with some type of push-up because that really is the best option outside of dips. We're talking about trying to limit the equipment here, right? I said only one pull-up bar the body weight push up that I like here is the dive bomber push up because if you perform this exercise correctly, you're not just targeting your chest, but you're actually heavily targeting your shoulders your chest and your triceps at different ranges in the motion. See we  First started to say you're actually working a lot in your shoulders. And when you get down to the bottom of the rep, you're really maximizing your chest as you come back up and out. You're really Contracting the triceps as you get a little bit of extension back behind your body. You can make this even more difficult and more rewarding and even Target either the triceps or the shoulders a little bit more by simply performing as I'm showing you here a one and a half rep style of the exercise. So come down into the front if you want to work your triceps and instead of coming all the way back up head back up for one more half.  Rep and then come back up or if you want to work your shoulders a little bit more just simply stay at the top range of motion for just that extra half rep. You'll be able to give your shoulders just that little extra that they might need to start making them pop even more speaking of shoulders. There's actually a way that we can work them and still get in those conditioning benefits. I talked about earlier in the video and the perfect example here is a mule kick. This exercise is incredibly demanding trust me. If you haven't tried one try it. What happens is you got to support your entire body weight, whatever that might be.  And push your legs up towards the ceiling every rep is basically a version of a dynamic or explosive shoulder, press with your shoulder still in contact with the ground. So instead of trying to push the dumbbells up and away from you. You're trying to push your body up and away from the ground is definitely a challenging exercise and one you should try and talk about the conditioning benefits do this for a minute straight and I will tell you your heart will be pumping and you'll likely be breaking a serious way. Of course, one of the most classic conditioning exercises you can do when  And body weight is a burpee but a burpee alone is boring. We can do a lot more guys. If you want to train athletic again challenge yourself to do more things challenge yourself to do things and not just the sagittal plane up and down but make yourself more athletic by involving some rotation and the version I'm showing you here the Burpee is certainly a way we can do that. This is the sidekick through Burpee or just a plain old kickthrough Burpee. This is a bitch but I love it because it will get those lungs burning and no time. I promise you and again, it's combining a great.  Great amount of athleticism to do it. Yeah, there's some coordination involved here too. But I promise you if you just practice it a couple of times you're going to master this exercise and in doing so get control of one of the best conditioning bodyweight exercises you can ever do okay last but certainly not least. Let's break out that pull-up bar one last time and Ratchet up the difficulty level just a little bit more for one of the most rewarding upper body bodyweight exercises you can do and that is the front lever. The front lever is going to demand to muscle groups work together that don't normally prefer to work together.  That is the upper back in the court so you can do this because we know that the course going to have to provide the stability to fight that force of gravity is trying to bend you in half every single time. You lift yourself up and oh, by the way, the only way you can be able to lift yourself up is by having the adequate strength in your upper back to perform. What is essentially a straight arm push down without weights to get your body up and against that force of gravity. This is absolutely one of the best exercises you can do and it's one that commands respect because everybody knows it's pretty damn hard to do don't be discouraged if you can't do it.  You can always break out and assist a band to try to Anchor your feet in until you build up the strength to be able to do the exercise fully but still whatever way you wind up doing. It is still a great exercise and one of the best to add to your body weight exercise routines. All right guys, so there you have it eight exercises to prove. Once again that bodyweight training does not have to be inferior training as a matter of fact our athlean xero program. We're going to throw away the pull-up bar give you all the ways to work your back in your biceps without it not to mention combined strength and conditioning always  Give you Progressive ways to help you to build muscle that is available guys. Athlean xero and athleanx.com. In the meantime, if you found this video helpful, make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below and remember bodyweight training. You can change the way you do exercises just like we did with the dive bomber push up to elicit all the responses from those movements. You can change the way you group exercises together. You can change the progressions and you can regress if you have to it's all about how you put the exercise together that determines what you get out of them. All right guys, I'll see you back here again soon. Let me know whatever else you want to see and I'll do my best.  To bring it to you here three times a week.\",\n",

However, it can leave a person diabetic which means that the body can no longer control blood sugar levels and will require intensive.  testing of blood sugar and injections of insulin  The pancreas is an organ located in the upper abdominal cavity behind the stomach liver and colon.  Within the pancreas specialized clusters of cells known as islets produce insulin, which maintain healthy blood sugar levels the pancreas also produces enzymes to help digest food in order to alleviate pain and maintain insulin production. The pancreas is removed from the body processed and the islets are harvested. Once the pancreas is removed. It is placed in a solution and put into a machine where the pancreas is digested.  The islets are then infused into the patient's liver.  Within a short time the islets are expected to start producing insulin.  In 80% of patients the pain from pancreatitis is relieved by a total pancreatectomy. Overtime. Some patients may be diabetic and we'll need to take insulin to maintain healthy blood sugar levels. All patients will take pancreatic enzymes to help digest food after surgery.\",\n",
       " 'zD9aXZY0pdY': \"Angela comes from the Latin and jeer, which means to strangle and pectoris comes from Pectus, meaning chest. So angina pectoris Loosely translates to strangling of the chest, which actually makes a lot of sense. Because angina pectoris is caused by reduced blood flow, which causes ischemia to the heart muscle, or a lack of oxygen to the heart. Almost like the hearts being strangled, which causes terrible chest, pain, stable, angina.  Or chronic angina is the most common type of angina. And it usually happens when the patient has greater than or equal to 70% stenosis. Meaning 70% of the artery is blocked by plaque build up this small opening that blood flows through might be enough to supply the heart during rest, but if the body demands more blood and oxygen like during exercise or stressful situations, the heart has to work harder and therefore needs more blood and oxygen itself.  It's during these times of exertion or emotional stress that people would stable, angina have chest pain since the blood flow isn't meeting the metabolic demands of the heart muscle or myocardium, but the pain usually goes away with rest in the majority of cases, the underlying cause of stable angina is atherosclerosis of one or more of the coronary arteries, the arteries, supplying blood to the heart muscles.  Other heart conditions that might lead to stable, angina are ones that cause a thickened heart muscle wall, which would require more oxygen. This increase in muscle size, can be due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy from a genetic cause or as a result from the heart having to pump against higher pressures. As is the case in aortic stenosis, which is a narrowing of the aortic valve or hypertension. These larger thicker heart muscles, require more oxygen. And if the patient's can't meet the increasing demands, they feel pain in the form of angina.  Whatever the case the heart needs blood. And if we look at the heart wall, there's three layers, the outer most layer, the epicardium then The myocardium in the middle and then the endocardium inside the heart, the coronary arteries start up in the epicardium and then dive down and supply. All the heart tissue, if blood flow is reduced or The myocardium is thicker, blood has a harder time reaching the deeper layer just under the endocardium, called the sub endocardium. Therefore, the classic finding with angina is sub endocardial. Ischemia.  Meaning less oxygen is reaching the region just under the endocardium.  This is Kimmy has thought to trigger the release of adenosine, right? A keinen and other molecules that stimulate nerve fibers in The myocardium that result in the sensation of pain.  That chest pain is usually described as feeling like pressure or squeezing, and it can radiate to the left arm jaw shoulder and back, and sometimes is accompanied by shortness of breath, and diaphoresis or sweating, usually the pain and symptoms last less than 20 minutes and subside after the exertion or stress is taken away. And therefore, the heart muscle isn't demanding so much blood.  Now unlike stable angina which describes when patients have pain only during periods of exertion or stress but not during rest. There's also unstable angina, which is when patients have pain during exercise or stress as well as during rest. It never really goes away. Unstable angina is usually caused by rupture of atherosclerosis or plaque with thrombosis, meaning, a blood clot forms on top of a mound of plaque. Although the occlusion might not block the entire vessel. There's now even less room for blood to Flow by and the  Tissue is starting to feel starved for oxygen. Even while pumping at a normal rate, unstable angina for the same reason, a stable angina involves sub endocardial ischemia, and it should be treated as an emergency. Because patients are at a high risk of progressing to myocardial infarction or heart attack. The key distinction, is that unstable angina means that the heart tissue is alive, but ischemic or starving for oxygen. Whereas, myocardial infarction means that the areas of the heart tissue have already begun to nekros or die.  Now, a third type of angina is vasospastic angina also known as prinzmetal. Angina and patients may or may not also have atherosclerosis ischemia and resulting. Chest pain is due to coronary artery. Vasospasms mean, the smooth muscles, around the arteries, constrict extremely tightly and reduced blood flow enough to cause ischemia.  Episodes of vasospastic angina don't correlate with exertion and can happen any time including at rest.  The underlying mechanism causing vasospasms isn't well, understood, but likely involves vasoconstrictors like platelet. Thromboxane A2.  Unlike both stable and unstable angina, in this case, the coronary arteries constricted. So severely that all layers of the heart wall, being supplied are affected. Therefore it's referred to as transmural. Ischemia.  All right. So if we line these three up side to side, there's some important clinical similarities and differences first. It's super important to remember that in each case. The injury to cardiomyocytes isn't permanent meaning, it's reversible and the cardiomyocytes don't die which is how this differs from myocardial infarction, on an electrocardiogram or ECG both stable and unstable, angina show an ST. Segment depression. Since ischemia is limited to the sub endocardium.  In contrast, vasospastic angina shows ST. Segment elevation due to transmural. Ischemia.  Rest tends to relieve stable angina, whereas unstable, angina and vasospastic angina can happen anytime. Including at rest, in terms of medications. All three can be treated with nitroglycerin, which is a vasodilator that increases blood vessel diameter to allow more blood flow. In addition, vasospastic angina also response to calcium channel blockers.  Thanks for watching.

       " 'ZfSlQJk59Ng': \"I see me a very bad idea. We penis that's emotionally crying mood issues, hyper irritability even psychosis feel a psychotic behaviors, craving sweets, anxiety, depression, different, lower, mood situations, paranoia fatigue fear, how many people have these issues and they don't realize that it could come from a low blood sugar situation. So the  Eagle worst thing you can do when you have hypoglycemia is consuming sugar and I see people all the time. They have a bag of Candy by their desk or in their pocket. I'm like, what are you doing? Well, it's for my low blood sugar because they're thinking logically. Well, if I have low blood sugar need to raise it because the sugar will give me energy, but if you do that, you're just going to continue the process to make it worse. It's going to spike again and drop again. So it might be good for five minutes, but then you have the same exact situation. So you must  Never consume concentrated sugar, if you have hypoglycemia unless it's a real serious situation when your sugars are so so low, you know, you're having a because you're diabetic and it can come up and down that way. So, because in diabetes, you can have hyper, which is high sugar, and then hypo within several hours. So in that situation, you might need a temporary boost of sugar coming up. If you didn't eat in several hours, but most cases you do not want to do this because you're  Going to be able to correct it. So I want to point out some of the hidden carbohydrates that people are not aware of when we say no sugar. We're also saying, no juice. There is more sugar in Juice. Specially, apple juice. Then there is in soda. And I'm not going to talk about the obvious ones like soda, but fruit that's a hidden source of carbohydrates, grains, breads, pasta cereal, crackers, biscuits, waffles pancakes, those things, starches potatoes.  80's french fries, mashed potatoes. All that will are hidden carbohydrates. Even playing yogurt has a significant amount of sugar in it and of course, wine and other types of alcohol. So these are the things that will worsen it. Now. The question is, what do you do to fix hypoglycemia? Number one? There's a really simple, amazing herb that you can take simple. Being you can just  Go to the health food store and get it. It's called berberine and it's an ancient Chinese herb that's been used about 3000 BC. So it's been around a long, long time and even in certain studies. It shows that it mimics the effects of metformin, which is something to control the blood sugars. So, again, this herb, you can get to help with not just hypoglycemia, but hyperglycemia, which is diabetes. And by the way, hypoglycemia, is it?  Precursor for diabetes that comes before it simply because the person's eating too much sugar nutritional yeast. This is a lot of my different, a lot of different videos. This will actually lower and help regulate insulin, because it has the B vitamins in it. Put it in some applesauce or no not applesauce. Put it in, maybe some peanut butter or something like that. You can buy it in Wafers or tablets as well. High potassium foods that you might say.  Should I start eating? Bananas, bananas only have 500 milligrams of potassium. What you really need to do is have the big salads every single day 7 to 10 cups. It's not hard to do that. I just had a salad about a half hour ago and it's not a big deal that has a lot of potassium which will help store Sugar longer and help this situation exercise is a valid form of therapy for hypoglycemia or diabetes because it helps blood sugars and  Most important thing is make sure in the morning, you have protein for breakfast, do not skip that meal. Do not have carbohydrates because within an hour you're going to have low blood sugar. So this is the most important thing. A lot of people have hypoglycemia and the afternoon or in the evening because their breakfast is too much carbohydrate. So in your breakfast, do not consume fruit, Bagels, pancakes, waffles, you want protein, you want eggs.  Eggs, bacon, you know, hormone-free cheese, that would be the best breakfast for hypoglycemia. And I know I'm going to create other videos on this too. But even a hamburger patty that without the bun. If you did some of that or a bison burger for breakfast, I know it sounds weird, but I've done that many times and you'll see that your blood sugar issue, will just completely go away very quickly because it's really good fuel source to help balance blood sugars. All right. So those are the things you need to.  To do, this is the basics. So go ahead and start. I'll see you in the next video. Hey, before you go. I have a quick favor. I'm always looking for good ideas for my next video, but I would really like your advice on what you're interested in it, whether it's a burning question, it confusion some interesting idea that I could do a video on.

       " 'ZHTdmMJtY5E': \"Why treat it and how it affects me. I think, when you have an illness or like a condition, does anybody else do that with a like, have an illness so they don't look it up is that it's actually it's me. I have ulcerative colitis and my mum looks up stuff about. Yeah, all of the time and then tells me, what is PC era. So I thought it was having cysts on your ovaries. And that's how it affects your hormone balance, especially between testosterone and estrogen. Hannah, gonna tell me different. Three main features of PCOS. One is irregular periods. Your ovaries. Don't regularly release.  These eggs so that you don't ovulate excess Androgen high level of male hormones that can then make you have symptoms. So a mask. Yeah, excess facial or body hair and then other things about other fun treatments and then this is the polycystic ovaries bit. Yeah. This is what blew my mind. It says, 'your ovaries become enlarged and contain many fluid-filled sacs, which are called follicles, which surround the eggs. It's important to note that despite the name. If you have PCOS, you don't actually have sis.  I holds, but I didn't know that until literally about five minutes ago. I've always been told I had cyst growing on my ovary. They were permanently going to be there. They could fluctuate between big being big and being small. Maybe go on your way. Anyway, the difference between science that we had 12 years ago. And now I thought it was this that we're going on the outside of your ovaries and whereas this description. It sounds like she's inside your ovaries and the individual eggs inside are surrounded by this Sac which prevents that eggs from getting out which causes  Lots of fun games. So for you, what your symptoms? Okay, so I initially went to the doctor because when I started my period, they were incredibly painful incredibly irregular. I was very worried about it as like a teenage girl would be and they went and they were like, do you have excessive weight gain, even though you do loads and loads of exercise? And I was like, yeah. And they were like looks like you got a beard that and I was like I do. They were like, yeah, so you have cysts on your ovaries. That was the symptom that initially triggers me. Try like getting maybe you do also have  Cysts on the ovaries. Maybe they weren't lying because I did have an ultrasound, which involves by the way, drinking about two pints of water, and then a man, like, pushing down on your bladder people pee themselves during that big. So, I did have a scan to prove that I had PCOS, but I thought they were seeing cysts, but maybe they weren't seeing cysts. Maybe they were seeing bags, but the other symptoms that I experienced. They were just things that I thought were just wrong with me. I genuinely thought I was one of those chubby awkward Harry teenagers, which I could have been. But like one of the symptoms is that like you have a very low level  Insulin in your blood. I'm and so as a PCOS person. I'm always pre-diabetic. I'm not diabetic, but I'm always in that danger zone. So where did you hear that? It's about that you have low levels of insulin and that's the doctor as well. Fuck. You really should be like a game show called. Do you know your ovaries is your doctor lying to you? This is NHS website. Like, I trust this and it says, what causes PCOS the exact cause of PCOS is unknown, but it often runs in families. My mom doesn't have it, but I didn't know any of my grandparents. It's related to  Abnormal hormone levels in the body including high levels of insulin clubs fat, but I've been owned by my own every so it says, insulin is a hormone that controls sugar levels in the body, many women with PCOS are resistance to the action of insulin in the body and produce higher levels of insulin to overcome this. So it's not they don't have insulin. It's producing more insulin because the action of insulin isn't working. This contributes to the increased production and activity of hormones such as testosterone, which is where all of  That the physical things come from being overweight or obese, also increases the amount of insulin your body produces. So you're more likely to increase to produce more insulin. If you are more overweight. The other thing that I found really interesting is the fact that one of the symptoms of PCOS and one of your experiences is that you have a lot of weight gain, even if you are exercising a lot, it's been difficult to shift the weight in this, and then other places online. It was just like treatment for PCOS. Try losing weight. Yeah. So basically, I got diagnosed. I was like 15. And there's, I had this male doctor and he just looked at me.  Very sternly and he was like, you're fat. I remember going into the car and crying and my mom was like, what's wrong. And like, the doctors said that I was fat. I liked that stage me for a long time. I was already a really active kid and I was like running up gantries at 15 because I was working as theater, and I was like, doing quite a lot of stuff. It wasn't like sports, but it was like this is done something. I try and watch as my weight, but it's hard because I think it's also like because it's harder to lose weight. You don't see like a difference for like a year. There was a point in my late teenage years, where I was about maybe at for stone lighter than I am now, but I was doing manual work.  In the desert building Trail for 12 hours a day. And then I was a size 12. You like, this is the smallest. I was drinking four liters of water a day because that's how much exercise I was doing. Like, like, what have you done in terms of treatment? Have you done anything? So when I found out, I was put on the pill which felt very naughty because I was not sexually active, but I was like, I'm on the pill Dorothy. I mean even kissed a boy and I'm not supposed to go on like the normal pills, but it's a special one that's called dinette. I think it's like used for acne a lot. But it's also supposed to treat the symptoms of PCOS. Yeah.  Yeah, it's a tablet taken by women who have severe acne or excessive hair growth. It did also regulate my periods because they were like, really painful and irregular. So I guess that's okay. I took that for about six years without a break, which apparently is quite risky. It gives you the, the blood pressure of somebody who's pregnant came off. It University and just started feeling completely differently about my body as well on the NHS. I was given electrolysis, which is usually really expensive treatment, but it's really, really painful. It's a hot needle in your pour, it kills, the root of the hair.  And it's all around this really sensitive area. So if you want to be a girl, not bad for Hannah's patches where it's quite, it's worked and some patches where I have my say. Yes, you've got says nothing here. Yeah. Yeah, it's really weird. So I had that done for about a year, but it was so painful that it came out of it shaking and crying there. 10 minutes on like it's way more painful than any tattoo. Apparently. I got to that point where I think I was growing up and I was like, I'm telling my body, that's so unacceptable there to put it through all this pain, just to be normal and it was on the NHS of it felt like it was a good thing to do. I felt like I was like sensible and it but the only  Reason, they prescribe it is because obviously hair growth on women. Isn't attractive, not feminine. Yeah, and therefore, it's going to affect you mentally. So that's the way it's described by women that have facial hair. They don't even have PCOS. Yeah. Totally. It wasn't a good enough reason for me to put myself, all that pain, put the NHS through all that expensive. It's fucking really expensive and I just basically just said to them. I was like, I don't want to do this anymore, which means that I now have this weird patchy like hair grow things and I spent a lot of time like putting a lot of acid on my skin to like dissolve. It's you know, like there's nothing you put on your legs to like dissolves.  The hair, I do that, put it on my face and you're supposed to every like six weeks and I do every three days and it was really like not good for my sister's when you're in your early 20s. Yeah, and then like basically, I was like, I just don't care. Like, I kind of like just let go. And then now I just like shave when I feel like it like a man, like a legit. That's pretty funny. Because me and my boyfriend, do it together. And he's like, don't worry. It's fine. Let's shave together and be like, do it. It's kind like in Shrek, you know, when they go on holiday checked, so do that by also like, try and grow it sometimes just because I'm like, remember this is part of your body. It's a thing that's happening to you. Okay? Yeah, so that's  Lately changed me. So, have you also been off the pill since you were 21 now, so then I went on a different pill and that like fucked my head a bit as well and I came off it. Like when I came off the pill, I felt completely differently about that. People are attracted to and like, broke up with my fiance. It really does fuck with everything about you. And it made me feel really comfortable to know when on a coil for a little bit. And that was really painful to come off that and now I'm on nothing. It's not a vice but I don't want to fuck with my hormones anymore. Yeah, and it upset me a lot. So I didn't want it. If you have PCOS you might find it hard to get pregnant. Usually you can live treatment.  But since I've known you, you've always been like, I don't want kids. I fucking hate. And then I was wondering, like, does you not wanting to have kids? Is that coming from you? That's really feeling proper? Yeah, when you were 15, you were told that you wouldn't be able to. And so you've been conditioned yourself into not wanting that. I remember them going. When you have kids, you're going to find it really hard to have them. And then I was also felt really weird, because that's obviously one of the main functions in my brain of a female body and I was told really early on that. I might not be able to do that. And that was like really confusing because feminism Henry  Each country yet. Something that doesn't bother me in later life because I don't really think I want them. Still one of my friends are always like oh and I'll kick in Rio just you away. And I'm like, it's not something that I think would upset me if I didn't want as well. I'm also on loads of like PCOS, Facebook groups of like people who have PCOS across the world. Yes, a lot of people. A lot of people join those groups because they're trying to get pregnant and they can't and they're really upset about is there's a lot of, like, heavy emotional stuff and there's one post. I saw the other day. It was like, somebody was like, comment below to show how many times you've tried to get pregnant. Green was.  Like you lost it and like red was like, you got it and it was like green green green, green, red green, green, red, green, green, Green six kids in heaven. Like, so I'm looking at it, like, you know, it's so heavy. And it's so upsetting, and it's like, yeah, people can get pregnant, but I don't really want to go through that for some people. It's a really key part of their future, and I completely get that and I'm like, yeah, go for it for me. It's not. That's Heavy. Yeah. Sorry. That's that's the reality of it though. I think is yeah. It's really I wouldn't have that without the internet. How do you kind of deal and  In terms of like a mental health way and like a body positive way of like being happy with yourself in the body that you have, knowing that you've got a condition that affects the way that your body looks. I think I forget it, a lot of the time. Okay, sometimes it stops me from holding myself to such high standards because I'm like, have a cake. You've got PCOS, maybe not good, especially if you're pre-diabetic, but it's a thing of like, giving yourself a break, then also remembering that you do have a pre-existing condition that could result in diabetes at any moment. Yeah. I sometimes have a really good relationship with my body.  And sometimes I really don't and it's like this thing of like and I know it's a weird one, but I'm working on it. And I think that I just treated, like his eccentric. Cam like my body hung on like like nobody's business treat me with affection, but also reality. It's like a kid. You're like, okay. Do you have anyone in like your real life, like friends, who also have it, who you can go to? Now? I think I've found out more people have it. So when I was 15, it's really like a lot rarer to be diagnosed that young, a lot of people develop it later in life. So the older I get, the more people around me will have PCOS. So I think now I have more people one in every five women.  In the UK have it and more than half of these women don't have any symptoms. That's crazy. So, I mean, I might have more friends that have it but we don't know. Maybe reading that makes me think how many women don't have any symptoms and they only find out once they try and get pregnant because they have trouble getting pregnant. Like wine. They go into the test and they find out they have. It is definitely a chubby, a kid and I didn't really understand why and I like my friends 8 because I have no idea. Have a little over voice, but I don't know if that's like a thing. I don't know. And then it's also the body had made me feel like I wasn't a gonna be a girly girl.  Like I couldn't be a girly girl. So I was like, gonna be a tomboy. If I was like doing drama, I'd always be picked to play the man, if there weren't enough man or like stuff like that, and I'm like, really. Hey. Yeah. Well like the nature and the mom, I was always playing the mom in like, every single play because I was like, a bit chubbier. I guess we should finish it on any advice you have for people who maybe have PCOS or they have symptoms. And they're like, is this thing that I maybe have Adam, because it's such a common thing. People are currently living their lives and dealing with it, like easily. Never like think of myself as somebody who has a, like a\",\n",

       " 'Zpb2VHgjCQs': \"Hello, I'm Tom Mason of the diabetes, Council.com researcher writer and I have type 2 diabetes. Today. I want to talk about the glycemic index after you watch the video today. I do invite you to check out the description box for my new e-book. This is one of the most comprehensive diabetes meal planning book. You can find anywhere it contains, diabetes friendly, meals, recipes recipes for different goals, such as 800 or 1800 calories. Day meal plans, diabetes meal, planning tips and tricks. There are also tons and tons of diabetes friendly recipes for everyone. Let me State up front that why? I believe the vice emic index is a very important tool for those of us with diabetes. I truly believe. The glycemic load is a better tool but the glycemic load uses the glycemic index in its calculation. Therefore understanding the GI is also an important concept to get the absolute best research.  So for this project, I will be quoting a lot of material from the official website of the international GI database which is hosted by the University of Sydney that web address is www.osemtv.com. Now, this website is an extraordinary research tool with a plethora of information about the glycemic index and I truly invite you to visit this site if you want to know more about this topic, but as I stated all of my research was done on this extensive website,  Not the vice emic index is a ranking of carbs, on a scale from 0 to 100, according to the extent, to which they raise blood sugar levels after eating. The ranking is as follows foods with a GI of 55 or less is considered a low GI food food for the GI of 56. 269 is a medium GI food and foods with a GI of 70, or higher is a high GI food. Now food to the hi.  Hi GI are those which are rapidly digested and absorbed this results in a yo-yo effect. In the blood sugar levels, low GI foods are digested and absorbed in a gradual way. This produces a much more even rise in blood sugar and insulin levels. Now, research has proven this much more beneficial to the health of those with diabetes. Low GI diets have been shown to improve both glucose and lipid levels. In people with diabetes, both type 1 and type 2 weight can be  Much better with a low GI diet. Low GI foods are absorbed slowly, which helps keep you Fuller longer the impact on your blood sugar is minimal. And you will see a reduction in insulin levels and insulin resistance. Now, recent studies from the Harvard School of Public Health indicate that the risk of type 2, diabetes and coronary heart disease are strongly related to the GI of the overall diet, the World Health Organization and food agriculture organization.  Recommends that people in industrialized countries, based their diets on low GI Foods in order to prevent the most common diseases of affluence such as coronary, heart disease, diabetes and obesity. Now, I found it very interesting, how a GI value, for a particular food is determined according to the GI website, quote, to determine a Foods GI value, measured portions of the food, containing 50 grams of available carbohydrate or 25.  Of available carbohydrate for foods that contain lower amounts of carbs are fed to 10 healthy people. After an overnight fast, finger prick, blood samples are taken at 15 to 30 minute intervals over the next two hours. These blood samples are used to construct a blood sugar response curve for the two-hour period. The incremental area under the curve, is calculated to reflect the total rise in blood glucose levels. After eating the test food. The GI value is  Calculated by dividing the iau, see for the test food, by the I UA C, for the reference food, the same amount of glucose and then multiplying by 100. Now the chart on your screen may make that a little bit more clearer. There is now a push by some to have terms like sugars and complex carbs. Be removed from the nutritional label and replaced with total carbs. That's carbs - dietary fiber and glycemic index. The main problem with this concept is that there are  Very few places who conduct legitimate GI calculations the human nutrition unit at the University of Sydney has been at the Forefront of glycemic research for over two decades and is tested hundreds of foods as an integral part of its program. Now, if you watched any of my videos at all, you know that I'm an advocate of the glycemic load, rather than just the glycemic index. But if I seem again decks basically only tells us how quickly a food is digested and gets into the bloodstream. But the glycemic load,  Takes into consideration every component of the food as a whole, it tells us much more about how the food will affect our blood sugar overall with glycemic load. The numbers are a bit different foods to the GL of 10. And below are considered low g l foods with hgl between 11 and 19 are considered medium GL and foods with a 20 GL or boar is a high G L food. Now, because the glycemic load of a food looks at the food as a whole and not just the  The same food can have a high GI but an overall low GL, making it better for you than it. Originally might have been have appeared take watermelon. For example, if you looked at the GI of watermelon, you wouldn't need it at all. Why? Well depends on the type melon actually, but the GI of watermelon can be between seventy and ninety five. So you are told as one with diabetes. You can't eat that. It's G is way too high. There's too much sugar, but the glycemic load of watermelon is between  Six, it has very little impact on blood sugar. So you might not have considered watermelon on the basis of GI, but the GL is so low. It's a great summertime snack and I was very pleased to see the following on the GI website quote glycemic load or GL, combines both the quality and quantity of carbohydrate in one number. It's the best way to predict blood glucose values of different types and amounts of food. Now, that really  We made me feel well validates my hypothesis on the GL. Now the formula to calculate g l is very simple. You take the GI multiply the amount of total carbs, divided by 100. Now the amount of carbs, the total carbs is that - dietary fiber, you take the carbs - a dietary fiber. And this is also specific to an amount of food. So, let's do a calculation. For example, you're told is a person with diabetes. You shouldn't eat white bread. Well, let's look at this, the  I have Wonder, Bread is 70, that's a high GI food one. Slice of Wonder Bread has 15 carbs, one dietary fiber. So our formula would be 70, which is the GI x 14. That's 15 minus 1 divided by 100. This equals nine point eight. Wonder Bread, has very little impact on your blood sugar. A slice of Wonder Bread can be wonderful for you now. I hope this has shed light on the glycemic index and possibly  only a little more about the glycemic load as well. Don't forget to get my new e-book and please subscribe to our channel for many more videos like this one in the future. Thank you so much for watching. I'm time Mason.\",\n",
       " 'zPdwsCTp4gM': \"Of different degrees.  It is more common in Asian and Mediterranean women. And in women with darker head hair.  So what are the causes of hirsutism? There can be many reasons for excess facial hair in women?  One of the main causes is due to the action of androgens, the family of hormones, that includes the most well-known testosterone.  Though androgens elusive cold male hormones. This is misleading.  All adult males and females have biologically active levels of testosterone in their blood.  In males androgens stimulates sexual feelings, but their role in this regard is far less clear in women. All women produce some testosterone. However, women's levels are usually only five to ten percent of men's levels.  Higher than normal levels. In women may increase her sex drive affect the menstrual cycle and produce excess facial and body hair.  Puberty testosterone levels. Begin to rise in both sexes, but much more sharply in boys.  Some of the novel events produce by androgens at puberty are the appearance of pubic and underarm hair while we think of these. As the only places, a woman has body hair, most have some on other areas as well. Lower legs upper thighs between the navel and pubic region on the chin upper lip lower back neck and cheeks.  For a few, the amounts are greater and embarrassment and self-consciousness as a result.  One of the main causes of high levels of male sex hormones in premenopausal women is polycystic ovary syndrome, a condition which causes cysts to grow around the edge of the ovaries, the organs, which produce eggs and sex hormones in premenopausal women, some have increased sensitivity to male sex hormones rather than increased levels.  This means that they can have a greater effect on the body, causing things like excess hair growth and a deep voice, the cause of excess hair growth in women who have already been through the menopause, is use your hormone imbalance resulting from the menopause itself.  Surprisingly, and I've experienced this myself women with hirsutism are often not believed when they turn to their doctors for help.  Some doctors May term women that the condition is hereditary with the implication that nothing can be done about it. While there is no question that some families and ethnic groups have a tendency to more hair. This does not mean that there cannot benefit from treatment women with increased hair, should not be put off by this attitude.  So, how much hair is normal for a woman?  Well, I can tell you this there is no absolute answer.  You may be surprised to know that half of American women remove facial hair at least once in awhile and 10% remove it to on what times a week. And many of the women who have hirsutism remove more often than that.  Some even use a razor once or twice a day because their facial hair grows as quickly as a man's in the media photographs of women, do not show how much facial and body hair they really have.  The result is that women with an average or slightly more than average amount of hair, think they're abnormal.  Feeling like this can create a feeling of isolation. I'm here to tell you. There are millions of the women who have hirsutism around the world reality check, heavy hair growth on women, is not as rare as people think because women with this problem, do all they can do to hide it. Most never discusses problem with friends, because it feels so embarrassed about it.  If you suffer from hirsutism, have you ever found yourself not wanting to sit under a particular light? Because it could show your stubble or do you carry a pair of tweezers and a small mirror everywhere you go and to any opportunity managed to sneak peek and check normal did hairs of appeared.  In our modern world, have you noticed that a woman on TV or in films or magazines never seemed to have any extra her?  The reality is different.  There are some really well-known actresses who have a considerable growth of facial or body hair for the either. Waxes off, all the cameras, kept slightly out of focus. A trick also routinely used to hide wrinkles as we all know, magazines are known for retouching as a rule.  Marilyn Monroe. Shaved, her face Elizabeth Taylor. Shaved her face. If you suffer from hirsutism, it's definitely worth visiting your doctor and finding out about the possibility of having your hormone levels, checked, and other possible investigations into the reason behind the extra hair growth. Do not be put off by our doctors attitude. If the try and fob you off.  Be firm.  If you don't get anywhere with you, Doctor try another one.  There is no cure for hirsutism, but there are treatments to manage the condition. Here are a number of hair removal methods, that may help.  Shaving snipping with scissors tweezing and plucking waxing threading, intense pulse light bleaching and the contraceptive pill.  Tweezing is the worst because it pulls the hair out by the root which injures the skin.  A bumpy look to the skin may occur if this is done over a long period of time.  Sniffing with scissors does not last as long depilatory. Czar. Hair removal. Creams that can be used on your legs under arms and facial areas. Make sure you choose the right cream for the area. You are treating, do not leave them on longer than the instructions say otherwise, there could be considerable irritation.  My experience, I found this treatment works. Well on upper lip and Chin. A razor is an effective way to remove hair but many women understandably, do not like to use this one. Despite widespread belief to the contrary removing Hair by a razor or other means does not make it growing faster or darker.  My experience. Not tried this one.  Facial threading practitioners pull hair out by a thread in a criss cross movement.  This one needs to be repeated every two to six weeks levels of pain do vary between women, but it's generally believed to be less painful than waxing, my experience one. I've not tried yet.  Electrolysis is a well-established method which is permanent. Continuing treatment is often needed for women with substantial hair growth because new follicles become active.  To get a good result. Electrolysis needs to be done by a skilled professional. Using proper equipment.  My experience. I persevered with this treatment for months, even though I found it quite painful. I ended up with folliculitis and gave up in the end.  Laser treatment has been heavily promoted over the years. It is said to offer permanent hair reduction pigments, her changes may occur from laser treatment and it's therefore not suitable for those with very light or very dark skin.  My experience. I haven't tried this method.  There is a possibility of skin can be burned during this treatment, which kind of puts me off. Plus the fact, it can be very expensive.  Intense pulsed light is similar to laser treatment, that uses various light wavelengths as opposed to laser removal, which uses a single wavelength. This is aimed at reducing the risk of burning.  This treatment is not suitable for women with darker skin tones. My experience gosh, really really painful, especially on the top lip area.  I did about nine months treatment and for the pain, the expense, 40 pounds per treatment, which is roughly $60 for lip and Chin area and the results I decided it wasn't worth it.  Waxing is effective. If done regularly around every two to six weeks and me reduce regrowth.  However, it may be painful and can cause redness.  My experience painful and the pain doesn't ease with time.  I found this the only effective way of treating my bikini line without causing irritation.  It lasts about two weeks before regrowth starts.  The contraceptive pill for some women who have not yet started the menopause taking a contraceptive pill May control hirsutism.  My experience didn't make the slightest bit of difference to me other treatments.  There are also a number of unlicensed medications medications that have not been specifically tested for this purpose that are actually known to be effective. A note of warning in some cases treatments can lead to irritated skin or inflamed hair follicles folliculitis.  Folliculitis usually takes a few weeks to resolve itself and May mean that you can't continue removing hair until it clears up.  As the life cycle of hair is around. Six months treatment can take this long to work. So, it's important to start treatment as soon as possible.  Also be aware that new hair, follicles can be stimulated when using treatments.  In my experience over the years, the best trying out different treatments to find one that suits you.  My advice test test test before you treat a wider area, especially on your face.  And remember, do not despair. If you have excessive bodily hair growth, whatever you've been told it is possible to find out what is causing unwanted hair growth and to get effective treatment.  Treatment will not necessarily remove every and wanted hair but can reduce it considerably making removal, much less of a burden and giving you peace of mind. And remember you are.\",\n",

This glow-in-the-dark clock allowed them to watch the pancreas clock tick and while it was while watching,  Watching this clock, the team discovered how well, the clock ticked depended on, how much like the owner of the clock was being exposed to at night in the pancreatic islets of animals that experience, 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark. The clock, ticked, and talked to a regular rhythm. This didn't happen in animals exposed to light at night.  The clock still ticked but not quite as loudly. You can see this year. The clock waves are different. It seems pancreatic clocks tick better when they're put in the dark. Unfortunately, being in the dark doesn't always happen when we climb into bed. We turn off the lights but the lights in the neighborhood don't have an office.  Each being exposed to light at night is commonplace. Does it matter when the team explored further they discovered that insulin release in response to glucose was impaired in the Cox that had lost their Rhythm.

       " 'zU-5GcqzHNM': \"Enough sexism and we see it reinforced through every aspect of Our Lives.  We see it in the government that refuses to punish men for raping women. We see it in advertisements. How many of you have seen an advertisement that uses a woman's breasts to sell an entirely unrelated product or movie after movie, after movie that portrays women, as only love interests. These examples might seem inconsequential and her  List, but their Insidious slowly building into a culture that refuses to see women as people. We see this in the school. That sends home a 10 year old girl, because her clothes were a distraction to boys, trying to learn or the government that refuses to punish men for raping women over and over or the woman. Who is killed because she asked a man to stop grinding on her on the Dance Floor.  Media plays a large role in perpetuating the objectification of women. Let's consider the classic romantic comedy. We're typically introduced to two kinds of women in these movies, two kinds of desirable women. Anyway, the first is the sexy bombshell. This is the unbelievably gorgeous woman with the perfect body. Our leading man has no trouble identifying her and even less trouble having sex with her.  The second is our Leading Lady the beautiful. But demure woman, our leading man falls in love with despite not noticing her at first or not liking her. If he did. The first is the slut, she is to be consumed and forgotten. She's much too available. The second is desirable, but modest and therefore worthy of our leading man's future babies, marriage material. We're actually told that women have two roles so on, but these two  Those have a difficult time existing within the same woman on the rare occasion that I share with a new acquaintance that I study sex. If they don't end the conversation, right? Then they're usually pretty intrigued. Oh, tell me more. So I do, I'm really interested in studying the sexual behaviors of pregnant and postpartum couples. At this point. I get a different kind of response. Oh,  oh, huh. Do pregnant people even have sex. Have you thought about studying sexual desire or orgasms? That would be interesting and sexy. Tell me, what are the first words that come to mind when you picture a pregnant woman. I asked this question in a survey of over 500 adults and most responded with belly or round, and  Cute. This didn't surprise me too much. What else do we label? As cute? Babies puppies, kittens the elderly, right? When we label an adult as cute though. We take away a lot of their intelligence. Their complexity. We reduce them to childlike qualities. I also asked heterosexual men to imagine a woman that they're partnered with is pregnant and then asked women to  That they are pregnant and then tell me the first words that come to mind when they imagine having sex.  Most of the responses were negative.  Gross, awkward not sexy, bod and comfortable. How not worth the trouble not worth the risk. That last one really stuck with me. We might think that because we divorce pregnant women and moms from sexuality. We're moving the sexual constraints, the constraints of sexual objectification. They experience less sexism, right?  Not exactly what happens. Instead is a different kind of objectification in my efforts to explain this to others. One conversation, led to the Venus of Willendorf. A Paleolithic figurine Scholars, assumed was a goddess of love and beauty. Hence, the name Venus, this theory was later revised, though, when Scholars noted, the sculptors obvious focus on the real. The figurines reproductive features large breasts considered ideal for  Arcing around, possibly pregnant, belly, the remnants of red dye alluding to menstruation. Our birth. They also assumed that she was meant to be held or placed lying down because her tiny feet. Don't allow her to be freestanding. She also had no face for this reason. It was assumed that she was a representation of fertility and not a portrait of a person. She was an object in the history of her interpretation. She  From object of ideal beauty and love to object of reproduction. I think this transition speaks more about the scholars who have interpreted her purpose, then the actual purpose of the figurine herself when a woman becomes pregnant. She leaves the realm of men's sexual desire and slides into her reproductive and child rearing role in doing. So she also becomes the property.  Of the community, considered very important, but only because of her, because she's pregnant, right? I've taken to calling this the Willendorf effect. And once again, we see it, reinforced in many aspects of her life. Has anyone here ever been visibly, pregnant?  That's right. So how many of you ever had a stranger touch your belly during pregnancy, maybe without even asking your permission first, or told what you can and cannot eat by somebody who's not your doctor? Your medical care provider or asked, private questions about your birth plan, and then told why those choices are all wrong. Yeah, me too, or had a server refused to bring bring you a glass of wine. This one might give you pause. I know.  Stay with me. This is a huge secret. It is actually safe to drink in moderation during pregnancy. Many of us don't know this because doctors don't trust pregnant women with this Secret.  Especially if she's less educated or a woman of color. What this tells us is this Willendorf effect. It's also classist and racist. Its present when the government reminds when the government reminds women with every new anti-choice bill, that the contents of her uterus are not her own. Or when an OBGYN, says, while it's safe to have sex during pregnancy. Sometimes you never know better safe than sorry, right?  She's denied basic privacy and bodily autonomy. Under the guise of be a good mother. We don't trust her to make her own decisions. She's cute. Remember mmm.  When we tell women that sexual pleasure, sir, excuse me, when we tell women that sex isn't worth the risk during pregnancy or were telling her, is that her sexual pleasure doesn't matter. So we are telling her is that she in fact, does it matter? Even though the needs of her fetus are not at odds with her own needs. So medical providers such as the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology have the opportunity to educate.  Hate about the safety of sex during pregnancy. So what do the experts say? ACOG actually has no public official statement about the safety of sex during pregnancy guidance from the Mayo Clinic is generally positive, but presented with the caveat. Although most women can have safely have sex throughout pregnancy. Sometimes, it's best to be cautious. Some women don't want to have sex during pregnancy and that's okay. Some women do want to have sex during pregnancy.  See, and that's okay, too. What needs to stop is society telling women what they can and cannot do with their bodies.  Pregnant, women are not faceless identity, less vessels of reproduction who can't stand on their own two feet, but the truth is the real secret. Is we tell all women that their sexual pleasure doesn't matter. We refused to even acknowledge that women who have sex with women, or women who don't want children even exist. Oh, it's just a phrase. She just needs the right man to come along. Every time a woman has sex simply because  It feels good. It is revolutionary. She is revolutionary. She is pushing back against society's insistence that she exists simply for immense pleasure or for reproduction a woman who prioritizes her sexual needs is scary. Because a woman who prioritizes her sexual needs prioritizes herself, then that is a woman demanding that she be treated as an equal.  Oil. That is a woman who insist that you make room for her at the Terrace at the table of power. And that is the most terrifying of all because we can't make room for her. Without some of us. Giving up the extra space, we hold.  I have one last secret for you. I'm the mother of two boys and we could use your help even though even though my boys hear me, hear hear me say regularly that it's important for men to recognize women as equals and they see their father modeling this. We need what happens in the world to reinforce. What happens in our home? This is not a men's problem.  Or a woman's problem. This is everyone's problem. And we all play a role in dismantling systems of inequality for starters. We have got to stop telling women what they can and cannot do with their bodies. This includes not treating pregnant women like community property. If you don't know her, don't even ask to touch her belly. You wouldn't anybody else don't tell\"}"

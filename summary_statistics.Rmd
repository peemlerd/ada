## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Download the libraries here
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
library(graphics)
library(dagitty)
library(papeR)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(dplyr)
library(naniar)
library(mgcv)
library(pander)
library(caret)
library(corrplot)
library(tidyr)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
df <- read.csv("/Users/lerdp/Desktop/ADA/summary_data.csv")
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
boxplot(age_at_admit ~ deceased, data = df, xlab = "I(deceased)", ylab = "Age")
boxplot(age_at_admit ~ gender, data = df, xlab = "Gender", ylab = "Age")
table(df$deceased, df$gender)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
